# English-Composition-Generation
An English composition generator based on GPT-2 implemented with Gradio
<br>
This is my final year project for my undergraduate degree. The finetuned GPT-2 model can generate English composition based on keywords defined by users. For reduction of computational complexity, a small version of open-sourced GPT-2 model by Hugging Face is chosen for this project. The dataset of model composition is scraped on a website called studymoose. The final demostration is implemented with Gradio.
