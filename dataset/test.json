"The swift actions taken by Goodell when he said, \u201cthe NFL can help create change in society due to the cases of domestic violence\u201d, he had already created many programs to help with it. Goodell had also partnered with hotlines for domestic violence and within a week, seen an 84 percent\u00a0increase in calls (Goodell). He also said that the punishment for behavior for domestic violence will be consistent, clean, and current consequences (Goodell). These proceedings can enhance the many cases of domestic violence in general."
"The Plan, however, provides no strategy on how this is to be achieved. All it suggests is that \u201clocal labour, particularly graduates, will have to change their mindset so as not to be too choosy in selecting occupations.??? (p.250). In other words, the Government really has no idea on how to reduce the country\u2019s dependence on foreign labour. Hence it has opted for a hands-off policy for fear of disrupting the lifeblood of our economy."
"The pull factors include higher incomes, lower taxes, better weather, better employment availability, better medical amenities, better education services, better conducts among people, family reasons, political stability and religious tolerance. In the United States, there are five myths about emigration, these common myths are historically and typically concerned with the immigrant populations these myths state that: o America is flooded with immigrants o emigrants are taking jobs from the U. S. citizens emigrants are draining the on United States society\u2019s resources o Aliens refuse to assimilate, depriving us of our cultural and political unity o Non-citizen emigrants should not be permitted to the Constitutional rights. In his arguments. Advantages of emigration When people leave heir country and settle in another country, there a rise in the supply of the unskilled labor in that country, this is because many immigrants end up occupy low paying, low skill jobs and therefore their presence is normally complementary."
"Development of children and young people are describe In five deferent areas; physical, cognitive, communication, social ND emotional and moral development. Physical development describes the development of the physical movements. This is divided into fine motor skills, gross motor skills and locomotive movements. Fine motor skills involved skills such as tying shoes laces and gross motor skills involving larger movements such as throwing a ball. Locomotive movements involved the development and learning of movements such as balance and walking."
"In North America it can comprise discrete groups with territorial claims, such as the Native Peoples and the Quebecois, whereas in Europe, groups with such requirements, like the Slovaks or the Scots, are thought of as nations and multiculturalism refers rather to a\u00a0post-immigration urban melange. In addition, while in North America, language-based ethnicity is seen as the major political challenge, in Western Europe, the conjunction of the terms \u201cimmigration\u201c and \u201cculture\u201c now nearly always invokes the large newly-settled Muslim populations which collide with the original Christian civilisation."
"One can\u2019t be too harsh in critiquing a movie when its predecessor is a novel by John Steinbeck. There can be, naturally, absolutely no comparison to the human imagination, but Sinise does it with only a few imperfections and adjustments to the plot. Let me commence with Sinise\u2019s choice of casting. Lennie, played by John Malkovich, maintains the childlike, simple character Steinbeck creates in his novel. Other film critics might disagree with me, but I believe that Malkovich was entirely convincing throughout his performance."
"It begins from six class to eight and also it is not well organized due to the insufficient teaching staffs. In some institution of the government it is based on class 1 to 8, but in this system all subjects are taught to students. According to report of 2012 the total number of the girls were about 44% in government schools."
"They argue that because women now also have the pressure and expectation of working however they also still have the responsibility of running a family, this causes them great stress due to a lot of pressure from society and their families. Feminists believe that any medical issue should be treated with medicines. In regards to the case study this approach does not have a very strong link as Tamsela does not work and neither does her husband. However due to the extra pressure of her parents living with her she will feel more stressed having to care for them, she is also dealing with extra pressure as her husband does not work and there is no money coming in to the family."
"But this is perhaps its greatest weakness. There is much more involved in children\u2019s play than in providing additional playgrounds. Siolta\u2019s Research paper entitled Standard 2 Environments emphasises indoor and outdoor play. It states that indoor and outdoor environment require planning at every level, including type of play, design and layout, compliance with health and safety, and the determination of what is developmentally appropriate for children of different ages. The paper advises that we need to consider the needs of all children and crucially that we provide a range of developmentally appropriate, challenging, diverse, creative and enriching experiences. The setting should become more than a just a place where children spend time but also a place where \u201ctheir initiative is encouraged, their competence is nurtured, and their curiosity is aroused.\u201d Aistear\u2019s Early Childhood Curriculum Framework Learning and developing through play paper is relevant. They point out that children love to play inside and outside, and benefit from both. They say that some are more enthusiastic when taking part in outdoor play and show greater confidence in the outdoor environment. They recommend that it is better if the outdoor play area is directly connected to the indoor area so that it can provide ease of access throughout the day. Much of what can be done inside can also be done outside and in the outdoor type of activities these can be provided on a larger and more expansive scale. However, it is important to remember that most of this research was conducted after this policy document was published in 2004. The plan was innovative in that it gave a voice to children. Only in relatively recent years have we seen a growing awareness of the importance of the rights of children. In 1989, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, introduced a framework or basis for children\u2019s rights. In 1992, Ireland ratified this Convention which provides the first ever framework within which discussions about the nature of childhood and the rights of the child around the world can take place. In 2000, the National Children\u2019s Strategy 2000 outlined a vision for all children. Then the National Play Policy document followed in 2004. Since then we have had in 2007 the Agenda for Children\u2019s Services, a policy document setting out a framework for all children\u2019s services. Furthermore, Aistear: The Early Childhood Curriculum Framework, 2009 sets out the context of enabling principles for all preschool children. The Children\u2019s Rights Alliance seeks to protect all children\u2019s rights. In recent years, we have also seen a wave of Acts and legal precedents providing more protection for children. All of these initiatives have changed how we view children in our society. We now see them as individuals and not part of a system. There is a change in our attitude. We now listen and provide support (Wyness, 2012). The National Play Policy was innovative in that it gave a say to children and more importantly listened to them."
"Although, male friendships tend to lack intimacy, they are less fragile than female friendships. Men are more likely to bond by engaging in shared activities, such as sports (side-to-side), while women tend to bond through the disclosing of secrets, talking, and spending time together (face-to-face). It should be noted, men tend to make friends easier as they do not question the motives of the other person or feel the same pressure to disclose personal information to maintain the friendship as women. While men may not share their inner-most feelings with their close male friends, studies have shown they are more apt to share these feelings with a wife, girlfriend, sister, or other platonic female friends."
"At one point the boy even comments on how she leaves in the morning and does not return until late at night. Similarly, Charles Kikuchi, a youth that endured the internment camps said that his adolescent sisters, \u201cIncreasingly diverged from their parents\u2019 expectations of modesty, domesticity, and chastity. They insisted on wearing trendy dress, dating male peers, and ignoring their chores.\u201d The article goes on to relay that much of the youngsters decline to conformity played out through vandalism, stealing, smoking, gambling, truancy, and general insubordination( Tong, 17). These behaviors, in some ways, mirror the girl\u2019s behavior in the novel. Moreover, the mother soon losses interest in all things related to war. She stops following the news, and often has an unopened book in her hand. She rarely even talks. These are the very things that defined the nameless character in the earlier stages of the novel. From another stance, the characters also lose their physical identities. The mother is initially noticed for her nice and well-kept appearance. In the opening of the novel she is dresses in a red beautiful dress, with new glasses, a handkerchief, nice white gloves, with her hair hanging down. At Lundy\u2019s Hardware, Joe Lundy complimented her a couple times, \u201cNice glasses\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s a nice red dress (Otsuka, 5-6)."
"Like the wine bottles in the past section it could just represent the unhappy times in someone\u2019s life. Many other paintings by Edvard Munch include the same bridge or pier, maybe this is a reflection on Edvard Munch\u2019s life, it could be a place he liked to go when life was getting on top of him, to look back at his own life. The painting can represent many other things, for example the fear in people\u2019s life, perhaps it represents death, or the fact many people are afraid of the idea of death although everyone has to face it."
"The film ended with a wedding- Daphne and Joe\u2019s. Daphne is a groovy mother who is keen on saving her daughter from the prison of loneliness for which she is captive. She proved it by doing the odd and unimaginable- posting a personal ad in a dating site. She used the power of technology and cyberspace in hopes of finding Milly\u2019s knight in shining armor. Milly was aghast at first but later realized her mother\u2019s strong love and concern for her. Without her mother\u2019s effort, she would have not known Johnny who appeared to be her promising husband. In addition, her mother found her great love in the course of finding one for Milly."
"Taking away their freedom is a way of restraining their moral behavior in society. \u201cBecause the wrongdoers had unfairly gained an extra measure of freedom from moral restraint, the natural way to restore a fair balance is to reduce the protection he ordinarily would have gained through moral restraints on the conduct of others. By treating the wrongdoer in what is ordinarily a forbidden way, we strip away part of the protection that moral restraints on behavior would ordinarily have afforded him. Thus, we remove precisely the sort of advantages he has gained.\u201d (Roberts- Cady 3). A punishment is supposed to make the criminal reflect on their wrongdoing and get them on the right path. But why give the criminal the easy way out. Although many citizens believe in the saying \u201can eye for an\u00a0eye\u2026\u201d the death penalty does not necessarily bring closure to the victims\u2019 family. \u201cBecause of the extensive constitutional due process requirements in death penalty litigation, trials are lengthy, and appeals can go on for decades, for families of victims, there is no closure.\u201d(Dellapiana 5). Life sentencing with no parole is a much faster process and ensures closure to the victims\u2019 family."
"One of the writing techniques that the authors explore is the use of rhetorical questions. For example in the story of \u201cThe Gold Cadillac\u201d As the police arrest the father they ask \u201cWhose car is this boy?\u201d this shows the mistrust clearly, it is a rhetorical question because they know that the answer will be \u2018It\u2019s mine\u2019. They then accuse him of lying and take the car. This makes the final decision seem extra harsh as the police are just being cruel to the father."
"It might seem easy to determine one\u2019s own self interest, but do we sometimes take advantage of the choices we are given ? This question brings the case in the light of Deontological Theory. This theory is based on something other then the consequences of a person\u2019s actions. This theory has two approaches: Divine command Thoery and System of duties."
"One of the main arguments against gun control is a statement that it leads to a decrease in the level of crime, as potential criminals fear for their lives and health. To commit a crime in relation to a citizen with a pistol is much harder than to a person without it. In this aspect, the United States is a good example. To see the obvious evil or obvious good in a legal shortcut is somewhat strange: among the leaders by a crime rate, the number of murders and, by the number of criminal use of weapons, both the countries where the weapon is legalized and the countries where it is banned are located. Conversely, in the lower rows of ratings are also both states."
"Even in areas which are far away from their traditional role as a housewife. With changing times, they have risen [ up to the occasion and managed the work both inside and outside the home at her work place. \u2013 such as in industry, media, IT, politics [], technology, administration/ management, armed forces or civil services."
"The author managed to touch here the rotten nerve not only of the American society, which was temporary to him. He went far beyond the problem of the very racism. He explored the overall problem of hatred that ruled the modern societies, the cruelty, blood lust, despising people not only of the different skin colour but also of the different and lower social class and the keen feeling of own perfection. He makes us think why white people were so fond of keeping the black ones in the constant state of fear, confusion and terrible and scaring darkness. There is a great food for thought here."
"One implication that the teacher could find could be with the parents. If the parents refuse for the teachers to help the children with their development as some parents think they always know what is best for the child, which they are and they do know the children the best but not always when it comes to development. A teacher will have a major influence on a child\u2019s holistic development in different ways. They will help with a child\u2019s behaviour by setting examples of what behaviour is right and wrong in their classroom and showing praise for good behaviour and discipline for bad behaviour. A classroom environment can also have an effect on a child\u2019s holistic development. By the teacher understanding the student, they will be able to set up an environment the student will like and enjoy and feel welcome and the teachers can do this by asking the children what they would like in their classroom and using a few of the students\u2019 ideas. This will make the children feel a lot more welcome as they will feel that they have made a contribution to the classroom area. By creating an enabling environment where children feel welcomed they are more likely to use it and develop within it. It is not just the classroom where teachers can create this sort of environment."
"Immigrants play a huge part of the United States Agriculture and Farm Labor. From the Cesar Chavez movement to present day we see an increasing number of farm workers being immigrants and work tiring hours to provide fresh fruit or vegetables to the American household every day. According to \u201cEconomic Impact of Immigration.\u201d American Farm Bureau Federation \u2013 The Voice of Agriculture, Agriculture needs anywhere from 1.5 -2 million hired workers. These jobs are the positions that no United States citizen wants due to the minimum pay and tiring hours."
"\u2013 There is no doubt that the marketing efforts of Toys R Us in the past were certainly effective. The company is very good in letting individuals know that Toys R United States is the place to go to for toys. The marketing effort of Toys R United States was so great that despite the fact that the majority of critiques do not find the stores of Toys R United States as at the minimum appealing and enjoyable, parents and other adults in requirement of toys buck the Toys R United States experience just due to the fact that Toys R Us had the ability to stand real to the message of its marketing technique \u2013 that each and every single toy is found inside every Toys R United States."
"However, even though Monica is the dominant character in the relationship with Chandler, she still fulfills the role of housekeeper and cook, even though she works and her husband doesn\u2019t, for instance in this episode she stills cleans all the dishes, tidies up etc she is still the \u2018housewife\u2019. This is done to add a sense of familiarity and a sense of homeliness to the episode and overall sitcom. This differs from Elaine\u2019s character in Seinfeld\u2019s \u2018the contest\u2019; she attacks the typical gender roles and shows how social context has changed."
"Major cases and causes of infant mortality can be prevented and addressed through public policy. South Africa has a policy of screenings for birth defects in children, but not all women understand these screenings, their impact, the meaning and the follow up procedure. Institutional and public policy can also affect the protective factors and risks for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) for prematurity which ultimately leads to deaths Hitzeroth, et al., (2013)."
"The term \u2018American Dream\u2019 comes right back to our founding fathers because they believed that all people had the right on pursuing their true happiness no matter on their ethnic background. The people that want to achieve the American Dream would have to be hard workers in order to work their way up. Although later on the definition of the American Dream was starting to have a different meaning to people."
"With more opportunities to work, women tend to give birth at later ages. A religious belief is another factor to contribute to lower birth rates in some religions, as they values more a smaller family rather than a large family. In addition, some developed countries may offer free birth control through family planning services, therefore leading to childbearing at older ages."
"Research on animals is important in understanding diseases and developing ways to prevent them. The polio vaccine, kidney transplants, and heart surgery techniques have all been developed with the help of animal research. Through increased efforts by the scientific community, effective treatments for diabetes, diphtheria, and other diseases have been developed with animal testing (Bioethics). There are many reasons given for it to be necessary to work with animals in research."
"I know myself & my children see the world different as other families would also, experiencing life particularly in a broader light, which then indicates the importance of communication skills in my house- hold. Its growth and understanding a family we respect the style of speech we must use to bring together. Togetherness and support I was talking about earlier on. purposeless and positivity."
"Since our daycare/school begins at age six weeks and continues through pre-K (fours), Mildred Parten\u2019s research (1932) in the social interactions between children and play activities is clearly evident throughout the school. Infants engage in unoccupied play, which is making random movements, not really seeming to have a purpose; this is the beginning of play. In the infant and toddler years, there is a lot of onlooker and solitary play, but this can happen at any age. In solitary play, a child will play by himself/herself and will not notice other children are nearby. In onlooker play, children observe as others are playing, but do not attempt to join in. The next stage of play, according to Parten is parallel play, where children play side=by-side, but do not interact with each other. Parallel play lays the groundwork for the more complex stages of play which are associative and cooperative play. These stages occur around ages three and four. In associative play, the children begin to talk to each other and share materials and toys, but they really have no formal play organization. In cooperative play, the children organize themselves intentionally and may play a game with each other or build a structure together. It is very interesting to observe all of these stages as I visit classrooms and see the infants in the very early unoccupied play stage and then notice toddlers as they begin to develop in solitary, onlooker and parallel play stages. It is exciting to go into nursery and pre-k classrooms to actually see the associative and cooperative play taking play and realize how much the children are benefiting from these interactions."
"In this passage, Chanu rejects his wife\u2019s idea of attending English classes and uses the excuse of his wife\u2019s pregnancy and awaiting motherhood as a way of discouraging her. On top of that he also asks questions upon questions which may suggest bitterness towards her idea of going to school and attempting to fit in with society. Not only does Chanu discourage conform into society, he also discourages his daughters from becoming too westernized because he wanted to keep their Bengali culture rooted within themselves. Both Saroj from Serving Crazy with Curry and Chanu from Brick Lane being first generation immigrants demonstrate a common trait of resentment."
"An arm for an arm; a leg for a leg. This is a common theme surrounding the death penalty. While the first recorded death penalty laws date back to the Eighteenth Century B.C. under the Code of King Hammurabi of Babylon, punishments carried out by death have been used since the start of time. In the past, death sentences were carried out by means of crucifixion, drowning, stoning, burning alive, and impalement (Introduction). Nowadays, the most common method is lethal injection."
"Here is a fundamental injustice, which the Government has done very little to address. Genetic Engineering, Friend or Foe?

"My family has always been very close, we always look forward to spending time together. We have mostly gotten along and supported each other. Not to say we never get mad at each other, like the time my sister took my car without asking and accidently wrecked it, we do always work things out. Though we have not always lived near each other, my family has remained close through; the \u201cwonder years\u201d growing up, family holidays, and supporting each other during good times and bad."

"Gillick competence is a term originating in England and is used in medical law to decide whether a child (16 years or younger) is able to consent to his or her own medical treatment, without the need for parental permission or knowledge. The standard is based on a decision of the House of Lords in the case Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority [1985] 3 All ER 402 (HL). The case is binding in England and Wales, and has been approved in Australia, Canada and New Zealand."
"Hence the state ignores and denies the role of the uniqueness while rendering him to an anonymous unit. This phenomenon makes the individual vulnerable to the influence of the authorities and powers to use him as a resource to serve their agendas. He argued that it was the case in Russia then and will be the case in the Western world, as it is prevalently now."
"\u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d is the story of the triumph of true friendship and fellowship. In his short story, Steinbeck, probably like no other writer, brings the life of poor and destitute people to a new, symbolic level. The reader can definitely find in it a deep experience of the tragic feelings, as well as a message to the fact that, contrary to any incidents, life goes on. Through the finest and most sophisticated smears, Steinbeck depicts a verbal picture in which this deep-seated aspiration of the working class of America is veiled to the realization of one\u2019s own aspirations and hopes. The ending of the novel is painfully tragic. Besides this, avoiding dogmatic and formalized forms and postulates, the story reveals the vices that prevailed in that society: racism, sexism, intolerance, prejudices towards mentally limited people. He describes all these flaws within the framework of absolutely natural and human forms."
"As Maya continues her journey, she realizes that thousands of other terrified black children made the same journey as she and Bailey. Traveling on their own to newly wealthy parents in northern cities, or back to southern towns when the North failed to supply the economy it had promised. African Americans descended from slaves who were displaced from their homes and homelands in Africa, and blacks continued to struggle to find their place in a country friendly to their heritage."
"However, the state has interest in the 3 areas: health of its subject, a valid medical standard, and legitimate interest in potential life. They are distinct. Each grows as the women approaches term and at a point during pregnancy, each becomes compelling. In the light of the present day medical knowledge the compelling point begins by the end of the 1st trimester. * The state\u2019s important and legitimate interest in potential life, the compelling point is viability because the fetus has the capacity of a meaningful life outside of the mothers womb at this point. * The pregnancy prior to the compelling period can be terminated by the attending physician in consultation with his patient, and upon his or medical judgment, without regulation from the state."
"It is a very significant shot and creates the feeling of eventual happiness for Derek as he had been liberated from his troubles but in the worst way possible. The sound in a film is another major aspect of cinematography. It compliments the visual images to communicate the meanings of the film. At the beginning of the \u2018Cheerio\u2019 chapter a large crowd of people are seen gathered outside the prison in support for Derek. The screaming and chaotic noises represent how they feel about the case and portray sympathy for Derek and his family. Whilst the family are visiting Derek the tone of their voices are soft, almost whispers."

"And in the past when I got into fights with black kids I was the one who was always let off easily. Sure I might not be white but it shows that there is still a sense of privilege. Because whites see Asians as higher than blacks and not being ethnocentric but it is true. Although whites don\u2019t really have the backs of asian they put us in a position where we are seen as higher than blacks. Even in school today I can ditch my classes and walk around without a pass and not be questioned while the Hispanic kid right next to me will gain negative attention by the administrators."

"Martin (2007), states \u201cthe McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987 is probably one of the most important pieces of legislation passed for those suffering from homelessness or who are at-risk for homelessness, and prior to the passage of this act, the majority of homeless services were facilitated at the grassroots level. This act guaranteed government assistance for the homeless and homeless services. Funding included $180 million in 1987 and increased to 1. 8 billion by 1994\u201d (Current Policies and Legislation, para. 1)."
"In this novel, the experience of intimately and viscerally earthquake results into aftershock through the emotional and physical landscape. Protests take Antigone\u2019s life, the shoot-outs experiences in Attic Highway leaves Maria without a friend. The bonds, the influence, and the bonds are the main purposes illustrating the events that take place leading to their disappearance (Emmerich, 25-35). The layers described of cultural, political and interpersonal suffocation are present to all people. However, Anna breaks a clear conclusion which was told through indirect means of obituaries and clips. They suggest that Maria will never be a victim of circumstance after all. Although she was alone and tried to be in line with what her close people wanted her to be like, she was made to feel inferior during this process."
"However early in the novel Steinbeck uses animal imagery to foreshadow the death of Lennie and the death of the dream, \u201cshoot you for a coyote\u201d, the author highlights his vulnerability and his death in the future to suggest that his weakness academically is what possibly lead him to his death."
"Like stated before Troy isn\u2019t trying to harm his family at all. Troy went through a lot in his past and he doesn\u2019t want his family to go through that same experience he went through. He felt it was his job to be a father and protect his family from his past mistakes. Troy went to jail for fifth teen years for murder. A man he tried to rob pulled a gun on him so in retaliation he stabbed him. Experiences like this Troy doesn\u2019t want any of his sons to go down that path. Lyons is Troy\u2019s son from a previous relationship. While Troy was in prison, Lyons didn\u2019t have a dad growing up and he didn\u2019t really have guidance in the world. Lyons doesn\u2019t seem particularly bitter about any of this. He just seems to accept things as they come. Lyons passion is becoming a musician. Troy however doesn\u2019t see that as a serious thing. He instead sees that as a dangerous path. Troy says \u201cYou living the fast life\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6wanna be a musician\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6running around in them clubs and things\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 (Wilson 1041). Although Troy sounded harsh there, this was probably the most honest and sincere thing he told Lyons. Troy views Lyon\u2019s dream as a risk because he\u2019s not getting any income from this profession. Every time Troy gets paid, Lyon appears asking for a handout. This offends Troy because he never had handouts coming up. From the experiences of growing up in a white society, he believes that African Americans have to work for everything that they want. From the article, Susan writes that \u201cInstead of limitless opportunity, [Troy] has come to know racial discrimination and poverty\u201d (353). He wants Lyons to take on a safer route which is working somewhere with a structure rather than the freelance world of music. He doesn\u2019t want Lyons to get lost in that music world and result into doing the things he used to do that caused him to go to jail."

"It is frightening how those thoughts are similar to Nazism where the Germans believed they were a pure race threatened by the Jews. Even though we cannot deny that racism exists today, I am thankful that we have come this far and rights and freedom are not determined by race."
"Racism is always the serious problem in every country . Although it is 21st century , the racism problem still happened everywhere . Racism comes from different cultural values , ethnic backgrounds , as well as the physical appearances .

Racism have been one of the most significant issues that people have to face and fight for , and it is still occurring in our daily life such as in school ."
"WW2 came to an end, Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxemburg came to an agreement in London which aloud free transport of goods within their borders. Later on in 1951 Netherlands went on to join other countries in forming the European coal and steel community which played a big impact in economic growth as it rebuilt the countries from WW2. The treaty of Rome was then signed in 1957 by these same countries in which thus treaty guaranteed free trade within the region. Netherlands is one of the largest exporters of agriclutural products thanks to the EU\u2019s development of agriculturak policy which started in 1958 when agricultural minister Sicco Manshors was made European Agricultural commissioner."
"Having seen Willies bruises and realising he came from an abusive home Mister Tom puts in great effort to give him a happy, healthy life. He acquires warm comfortable clothing for Willie, unlike his current threadbare garments and gives him nourishing food, such as specially cooked breakfasts and tea. He provides Willie with books and reads to him each night much to Willie\u2019s enjoyment."
"In addition, she balances between the two worlds separately as she is one of the few black children. Starr struggles balancing her two worlds that of Williamson Prep and Garden Heights, police brutality, and unfairness treatment of the media towards her unarmed friend, (Khalil Harris), who was killed by a white policeman. For minorities, like Starr, they struggle because it is unfair for them to be treated differently than other people."
"As the North gained power over the national government, the northern Free-Soilers and the Abolitionists pressured the South on the issue of slavery. In a world where \u201cCotton is King\u201d the institution of slavery grew at the crack of a whip in order to fatten the pockets of the social elites. Their entire economic system was based on the institution of slavery. That is why they were so fanatical about it and that is why they refused to let it go. When the North went against the Constitution by allowing fugitive slaves to reside in northern states and not returning them to their owners, as was their duty under the Fugitive Slave Act, the South threatened succession."
"The fact that \u201cThe Strange Career of Jim Crow\u201d had no close substitute for an in depth analysis of the civil rights movement at the time it was published; benchmarking it is a problem and hence so is finding fault. The book also serves as a nucleus for further dwelling, as it is broad in scope, incorporating a vast majority of influences and time scales."
"Apart from that Hercules\u2019 twin brother, Iphicles was excluded in the storyline. Greek mythology portrays Hercules as a character with \u201clow intelligence and terrible temper\u201d(Royalty. nu, n. d. ). Although there was much difference from the original Greek myth, Hercules\u2019 character as half-man half-god hero with weaknesses was still portrayed. Hercules\u2019 character in the animated film was a bit naive but he was not quick to loose his temper. Audiences were also given a taste of Hercules\u2019 famous battles with calamities and creatures."
"This quick reaction to the lies fed to him by Don John makes plain his temperament and emotion driven mentality. Moreover, the fact that at that moment in time there are three layers of deception occurring simultaneously typifies the amount of deception there is in the play. Claudio is further deceived, along with Don Pedro, by Don John when he shows them Hero\u2019s apparent disloyalty and \u2018immoral\u2019 nature. In Act 3, Scene 2 Don John approaches Don Pedro and Claudio in order to \u2018warn\u2019 them of Hero\u2019s disloyalty."
"Many people overcame a change during this movie. Gerry, being the main character undergoes the most change and life-changing events. Gerry changes his opinions towards \u2018black\u2019 Americans becoming very close to Julius, who is often referred to as his brother. Gerry also lost the ability to use his legs, thus having to overcome that grief/despair and look for a new path for his life to take."
"I was bullied in art class by peers, and I was told I was demented for creating such pieces. It goes without saying I stopped doing my art. In retrospect, I wish that I continued just not at school. I feel an artistic soul that burns within me. I have been shutting it out for years. I have tried to quiet the inner voice, and it just always poured out. I wanted to try and reconcile with my happiness in this endeavor. I wanted to see if art and I could work things out. I wanted to see if the happiness I felt and the passion that burned within me could be reignited that\u2019s the pivotal moment I wanted to recreate. I wanted to be successful in my artful endeavors but also wanted to recreate the spark I once knew that existed. I was beyond successful in my aspirations!"
"Functionalists believe that the family have specific or traditional functions within the family. One function of the family would be reproduction or having children as this is imperative for the world as they will be the future workforce. For example family businesses will need to pass down the factories/shops to the next generation in the family for the continuing of the ancestors business. Other functions include economic maintenance this is where the family provides necessities for all the family members for example shelter, food and clothing."
"The speech starts to develop tension because there are a lot of negative and violent words used. For example, Alfieri uses terms such as \u2018Machine Gun. \u2018 The effect of using a term like this is to create tension for the audience, as they now know that something bad is going to happen later on in the play. As the play progresses the audience realise that this is the only time when Alfieri uses negative and violent language. So his words take on a deeper meaning when the audience realises this. I am now going to look at Eddie\u2019s language in the first act."
"Elon musk is known to be basically a genius. He created tesla and is a millionaire. He was the first person to launch a car to space to land on mars. Elon Musk believes that artificial intelligence is humanities biggest threat. He explains why and how things might end up in the video above."
"Some of these financiers and industrialists termed \u201ccaptains of industry\u201d made unimaginable fortunes during the Gilded Age (\u201cThe Gilded Age | Boundless US History\u201d, 2019). Andrew Carnegie owned U.S. Steel and companies involved in constructing bridges and railroads and also extracting and selling oil. J.P. Morgan was a successful financier and banker who reorganized the U.S. railways, bought the steel company from Carnegie and had interests in railroads, shipping, and steel. He was extremely successful due to his ability to monopolize entire industries. John D. Rockefeller invested in the oil industry, created a monopoly, and established Standard Oil (\u201cThe Gilded Age | Texas Gateway\u201d, 2019)."
"The third chapter is this book is titled \u201cFeng Shui Finance\u201d. In this chapter, Chatzy talks about how to take control of your finances and the less stress you will have because of good money management. Chatzy encourages us to take hold of your financial situation even though there will be moments when it feels like we have absolutely no control. I love the quote in the book on page sixty-one, \u201cGrant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the thigs I can, and the wisdom to know the difference\u201d (AA serenity prayer). This quote teaches and rectifies that not everything can be changed but many times we\u2019re are afraid to step up and change the situation that are in our control. I also learned that it is important to not tackle all your bills at once; take littles steps like these: toss the junk mail, organize the mail, file away what is done and take a little time of your day every day to do this process. It is easier to make habits when they seem easy to accomplish the same is applied to finances."
"My skills would certainly help me to face the industry as a well-equipped professional. Yet the completeness in being moulded as an engineer would be manifested in its totality, only after a post graduation with a specific area of expertise. It is this context that I came to the conclusion that \u00b7. (give specific names of the institute) will be the ideal place for me to take up my further education. I am impressed by the broad and deep experience of your faculty, your modern and flexible curriculum which is tuned to the changing technological times and your links with industry which will give me an education grounded in practice."
"It can be assumed that the reliability of Griffin\u2019s work is quite substantial. He had an insider perspective due to his covert observation and participant observation. His information was derived from a large population across more than one state, while still focusing on the southern parts of America. All the persons mentioned in the diary shared the same belief; whites were limiting the black potential. Then it must be asked whether the diary was biased or not. Since it was, in reality, a diary, the information published could be selective. This then questions the validity of the\u00a0research. There is no doubt that Griffin had opinions on the topic before it was investigated. However, the research was also very generalizable. This should help to alleviate many of the doubts towards the ethics of the means of research. Since human behavior is very complex it is difficult to narrow down the independent variable. All doubts on validity aside, the research was conducted in a method of sociological nature. It was a combination of participant observation, covert observation and unstructured interviews."
"Based on family size, most of the respondents plan to have a small family mainly composed of one or two offspring. In a matter of authority in the household, it\u2019s divided into two opinions: the father being the head is the majority followed by being equal of authority both of the mother and the father. Based on the residence most of them plan to have their own home to reside their family to start anew."
"Many of us might have contributed to the \u201c$59 billion worth of software stolen\u201d in the year 2010, even though we knew that it is not morally correct. While we the \u201cinstallers\u201d are considered as unethical, one may say that the \u201cuploaders\u201d are too equally the culprits as the installers. Many uploaders hack through the software to remove private information like certain security programs that blocks hacking, and installation crack. They later sell the so called pirated software to different websites for money where we \u201cinstallers\u201d can download from free."
"Practitioners can then plan the right type of education depending on the child\u2019s diverse needs. Again this relates to Froebel and Montessori\u2019s theory of planning and record keeping and gives the practitioner an insight into what the child knows and can do. More importantly it can help identify children who may have special educational needs. However, the practitioner was not the only influential adult in the child\u2019s education. Both Froebel and Montessori regarded the child\u2019s parents as playing an equally important role in the development of the child."
", railways, tourism, farming and mining. I think it is important to mention that the workforce from abroad had a huge impact and were a dynamo in the U.S. economy during the nineteenth century. Also, I should add that no matter the discrimination to which they were exposed, immigrants had an established goal to better their quality of life. The boom of industrialization in American at the end of the 1800\u2019s set the wheels in motion for the massive influx of immigrants. There were many factors that contributed to the exile of Europeans to America; among them we can enumerate the terrible famine, and the rapid growth of the European population. The Chinese got their initial entry into America during the gold rush. Chinese immigrants faced discrimination much harder than those of Europeans from racial slurs, even insults because of their appearance. The Chinese Exclusion Act was created to block further entrance of Chinese citizens to America."
"Pain and Panic, failed in their mission and only succeeds in making Hercules mortal. No mortal beings are allowed to dwell in Olympus, which leaves Hercules in the care of Alcmene and Amphitryon, the childless mortal couple who found him on the bushes. Hercules later grows into a misfit adolescent because of his extraordinary strength that always gets him in the center of chaos. His adoptive parents later tells him of his past and a medal found with him that is a link to Zeus, his father. Hercules then journeys to the temple of the gods."
"Nevertheless, that is still not enough since it does not specify my individuality. Ahmedabad is a fundamental part of my identity due to the fact that I was born in Ahmedabad. My moms and dads and I can speak its local dialect. Just put, my ethnicity is Western Indian and Gujarati. Also, I can speak English and Hindi and I am a Hindu."
"What Harris is expressing is that a woman may have the right to do what she wishes to her own body, but it would be wrong of her to exercise that right. The question then is; does the value of ownership of your body take precedence over the value of the foetus? Property is sometimes commandeered during war, and this action is usually justified because national security is thought to take priority over an individual\u2019s right to ownership.[8] Another compelling, and I think decisive, argument comes from Mary Anne Warren. She states that ownership does not give me a right to kill an innocent person on my property, furthermore, it is also immoral to banish a person from my property; if by doing so they will undoubtedly perish.[9]"
"Tastes were changing, but the product was still of high quality. Like many companies they offered a fresh new product and for Thorr Motorcycles this attracted younger consumers. In spite of this, they did not totally scrap efforts on the Cruiser Thorr and worked on revamping the image. Product Life Cycle The impact the product life cycle has on marketing is that businesses need to plan their products around the product life cycle. Knowing where the product is on the cycle, marketing strategies can be adjusted to maintain profitability. A particular firm\u2019s marketing mix usually must change during the product life cycle\u201d (Perreault, 2009). In the simulation the Cruiser Thorr was in the decline stage of the life cycle as their sales were declining rapidly. The declining sales were because the older audience\u2019s tastes were outgrowing the Cruiser Thorr and younger consumers were irritated by the high price. Cruiser Thorr was in decline stage, so a new motorcycle, the RRoth was introduced to the life cycle and aimed at a different target group to revamp sales and consumer perception. Conclusion"

Stephanie Russell-kraft\u2019s web article, \u2018The Right to Abortion- and Religious Freedom\u2019 published on March 3, 2016, states the \u2018U.S. courts have claimed to decide women\u2019s health cases based on privacy, but they\u2019ve often favored one particular faith\u2019s conception of when life begins.\u2019 Stephanie Russell. K argues women have the freedom to privacy under the Due Process Clause of the 14 amendment. She states cases of the court trying to draw boundaries after a woman has the freedom to do so at the time. There have been cases where women can\u2019t abort because of the importance of a state is to protect life, or potential life, of an embryo.

"It\u2019s no secret that raising a child requires mass amounts of money that many women who get pregnant don\u2019t have, especially if they have no partner to help them out. Poor and low income women account for more than half of abortions in the United States. Without the option to get an abortion, there would be many more children suffering because they have to live their life in poverty."
"Indonesia was also one of the organizers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1967, designed to promote regional integrity and collective welfare in Southeast Asia. In the United Nations, Indonesia has consistently voted with the developing countries. Its relations with China have been strained since 1965. The year of a pro-Communist rebellion in Indonesia, and the two countries do not have formal diplomatic ties. Relations with neighboring Australia also were weakened by Indonesia\u2019s occupation in 1976 of the eastern half of Timor, then a Portuguese colony."
"Attempts are made to present an \u201cidealized\u201d version of the front, more consistent with the norms and laws of society than the behavior of the actor when not before an audience (35). Information dealing with aberrant behavior and belief is concealed from the audience in a process of \u201cmystification,\u201d making prominent those characteristics that are socially approved. This legitimatizes both the social role of the individual and the framework to which the role belongs (67). Goffman also explores nature of group dynamics through a discussion of \u201cteams\u201d and the relationship between performance and audience. He uses the concept of the team to illustrate the work of a group of individuals who \u201cco-operate\u201d in performance, attempting to achieve goals sanctioned by the group (79). Co-operation may manifest in the assumption of differing roles for each individual, determined by the intent of the performance. Goffman refers to the \u201cshill,\u201d a member of the team who \u201cprovides a visible model for the audience of the kind of response the performers are seeking,\u201d promoting excitement for the realization of a goal, as an example of a \u201cdiscrepant role\u201d in the team (146). In each circumstance, the individual assumes a front that is perceived to enhance the group\u2019s performance."
"Gun control in the United States has been a controversial issue over past years, especially in light of the recent events of the Sandy Hook Elementary school shootings. Gun control is the regulation of the selling, owning, and use of guns. Americans have many reasons for owning and using fire arms, both positive and negative. The second Amendment of the Constitution gives the rights to American citizens to keep and bear arms."
"Throughout this novel, Lennie and George display a friendship unlike any other. It is so dysfunctional and rare it makes the reader wonder why these two are friends. For example, the boss says \u201cWell, I never seen one guy take so much trouble for another guy.\u201d \u201cI just like to know your interest.\u201d In this quote found on page 25, the boss is trying to make sense of their friendship. Even though this quote highlights the rarity of George and Lennie\u2019s bond, this causes the boss to suspect wrong- doing on George\u2019s part."
"1.3 Describe the potential impact of speech, language and communication difficulties on the overall development of a child, both currently and in the longer term. Speech, language and communication needs in children will vary from child to child including its nature and severity of the individual\u00a0difficulty. Early intervention is vital for all children with speech language and communication difficulties because it can have a profound effect on the individual\u2019s life."
"Gilho\u2019s first meeting with Wuseong was complicated by Wuseong\u2019s grimy goose, which offended Gilho and made him think of the term \u201cgoose father\u201d. A goose father was usually a Korean man who stayed at home and worked so he could send money to his family in another country. The occasional traveling to see his family was signified by the goose. Gilho denies being such a father and understands Wuseong to be spiting him by bringing the goose. This is a bad way to start a relationship, and Wuseong tries to remedy this by addressing Gilho with the term \u201cajeoshi\u201d. Gilho gives the two a chance, as long as the goose isn\u2019t too troublesome. Wuseong is grateful and tells Gilho to have a \u201cGoodnight, my ajeoshi\u201d, to which he responds with a shake of his head."
"After the initial meeting, the person starts to evaluate them and determine whether or not they think they should be his/her friend. However, to find the potential friend you need to learn the social skill, there are few people who are naturally this way, but before you get deeper in the process you must have known some personal information on the potential friends as everybody believes in personality typing ."
"Piggy is heroic too when he offers his smart suggestions, tries to organise the littluns, stands up for Ralph, democracy, law and order by confronting Jack, but he is also sick as he is lazy, jealous and very racist despite his intelligence. In Piggy\u2019s most heroic moment, Golding reveals his sickness when he says, which is better to be a pack of painted niggers like you are, or to be sensible like Ralph is? not allowing him to be too heroic as he believes that that we are suffering from the terrible disease of being human and that man is a fallen being and is gripped by original sin as told by him in Fable. Additionally the boys require masks to liberate them, suggesting a sense of shame. Like the concept of the other and the contextual use of savages, the boys also use masks to justify and allow them to give into their savage nature without guilt as you can hide behind it as Jack, hid, liberated from shame and self-consciousness. They also have painted faces of red, white and black which are Nazi colours; Golding clearly showing they are acting like savages just like the Nazi\u2019s who committed war crimes."
"Symbolic interactionism is the third social perspective on family. As the name suggests it focuses on the connection between symbols (i.e. shared meanings) and interactions (i.e. verbal and nonverbal actions) and communications. It is about understanding how humans create symbolic worlds and how those symbolic worlds shape human behavior. Symbolic interactionism emphasizes on families as social groups and on individuals to develop a concept of self and identity through social interaction and family activities. It helps understand the different types of personalities and the way they interact with each other to build and maintain social order, and how any change in this interaction can lead to disruption in that social order or at least a change in that order. It focuses on how self and society develop through interaction with others and helps explain and analyze many social issues as inequalities and dynamics of families. Thus, symbolic interactionists focus on interpersonal relationships between family members and emphasize the means to maintain them."
"In fact it is a very mistaken idea to remove children from the view of human love because mutual love is culminated through the fruit of love itself and is authenticated by giving service towards another.\u00a0 This unity is the basic cell of society which we call family.\u00a0 Today families are being threatened to decline because of the current problems regarding labor practices and housing decline due to economic crises."
"Across all suicide attempts not involving a firearm, less than 5 percent will result in death. But for gun suicides, those statistics are flipped: approximately 85 percent of gun suicide attempts end in death\u201d (Gun Violence in America pg 1). \u201cCWLA\u2019s National Blueprint points out that children and youth exposed to chronic trauma can experience inhibited brain development, producing a lasting impact on life outcomes\u201d(The Impact of Gun Violence on Children, Families, Communities pg 1). \u201cTragically, more than 35,000 people, including nearly 3,000 children, die from gun violence each year in the United States\u201d(Gun Violence Threatens the Health of Our Nation pg 1). \u201cAccording to a 2013 Kaiser Family Foundation health tracking poll, African Americans are far more likely to know a victim of gun violence or be personally worried about gun violence than white respondents. The poll found 42 percent of African Americans personally knew someone who has been the victim of gun violence, compared to only 15 percent of white respondents."
"This question is succinct but frankly more than most people want to tackle. After days of research, much thought, reflection and many moments feeling dumbfounded an adequate amount of information has been found to form an opinion. On the surface the answer seems obvious, right? From the beginning of time, every human has had friends therefore they must be essential to life. This argument can be misleading. Prehistoric Man needed each other because there was strength in numbers. In the last few centuries, the sheer number of humans and the close proximity to each other has forced bonds to grow between them thus creating friends."
"Sometimes alienation is self-imposed because there are circumstances where a person will feel like they do not fit in. The state of self-alienation\u2014 that of not being one\u2019s real self \u2014 is so predominant that its symptoms are not conspicuous. You miss noticing them because they are so general that you assume them to be \u201cnormal.\u201d For instance, Anzaldua feels this way when she says \u201cI remember the singing-type \u201cwesterns\u201d of Jorge Negrete and Miquel Aceves Mejia. When watching Mexican movies, I felt a sense of homecoming as well as alienation. People who were to amount to something didn\u2019t go to Mexican movies or bailes, or tune their radios to bolero, rancherita, and corrido music\u201d (Anzaldua 35). In other words, her feelings were ambivalent because she feels good, she feels like home but also at the same time she feels bad when watching Mexican movies. She feels this way because her new environment is different and lacks the aspects of her culture that she is used to. In addition, Cofer stated, \u201cI often felt humiliated when I appeared at an American friend\u2019s party wearing a dress more suitable to a semiformal than to a playroom birthday celebration\u201d (Cofer 104). She feels angry at herself and self-estrangement when she should not feel this way because she is an outsider. Both authors show a different cause of alienation which is self-estrangement in relation to society."
"African-Americans as well as Native Americans were affected by this discrimination. People could purchase the Native- and African-Americans and treat them however they wished without being reprimanded or punished. More and more people began to follow in these people\u2019s footsteps and purchase slaves as well. African Americans had a rough life during the revolution. Mary Postill is a prime example of the hardships that an African American slave had to go through. After she fled to Charleston, the military gave her a certificate of freedom. At the time, the military was controlled by the British."
"When I ask if Kyle, a shy, awkward boy, ever goes out and plays with his friends at the coastal nature preserve located two blocks away, his mother explains that \u201cwe don\u2019t let him go anywhere that\u2019s not safe\u2014what with the snakes and strangers and all.\u201d Kyle\u2019s mother is not alone when it comes to parents worrying about the dangers of children playing outdoors and such free-form fun having a negative impact on their studies. According to the results of a recent survey by the advocacy group, Make Time 2 Play, nearly two-thirds (63 percent) of parents believe it is more dangerous to play outside now than when they were children. \u201cParents should try and step out of their comfort zone to strike the right balance between safety and encouraging children to play outdoors,\u201d states Make Time 2 Play director Dr. Linda Papadopoulos."
"I feel wicked sleeping in a warm bed, while my dearest friends have been knocked down or have fallen into a gutter somewhere out in the cold night. I get frightened when I think of close friends who have now been delivered into the hands of the cruelest brutes that walk the earth. And all because they are Jews!"
"Miami is considered to be more dangerous than many other city of size. New Orleans is considered the most dangerous of all, followed by Camden, New Jersey. In 2008 the City of Miami Gardens was ranked as the thirteenth most dangerous city with a population in excess of 75,000 out of all cities in Florida. The expansion of the prison system by an additional 1,865 beds will be needed to handle the influx over the next five years. Official projections; however, suggest the number of beds that will be needed is far from adequate."
"These stakeholders will ensure the well-being of young men, women, and children whose lives have been affected by domestic violence are promoted through increased services provision, education, and awareness. Stakeholders play a critical part of how a business is run. Stakeholders have a true interest in helping an organization to prosper. When it comes to accountability it does not just come down to being accountable to themselves. Accountability lies with the customer, suppliers, government, community and employee stakeholders )BusinessKnowledgeSource. com, 2003-2010)."
"It is possible for anyone to experience an unexpected emotional or psychological side effect following an abortion. Women often report that the abortion procedure affected them more than they expected. It is also possible for some individuals to experience some type of emotional or psychological troubles. Those who believe that the fetus inside of you is not a baby until it is born are less likely to experience these symptoms but those who believe that it is a baby are more likely to experience the negative effects that encompass having an abortion."
"With the ability to respect others, he finds out who he wants to become. Steven has more of an understanding of himself. He is analyzing what he thinks a poet should do about love. Love means commitment and real poets don\u2019t commit themselves, not to no body. Steven is relating himself to what a poet would do, not to what he thinks is best for himself. He also experiences a wide awakening of who he thought he was. Steven was questioning if he was really a poet. Steven made an adult decision realizing he was not a poet because he actually loved her."
"The heat island effect, especially in summer, can lead to convective activity (showers, thunderstorms, hail) over large cities. During unstable atmospheric conditions rapidly rising air may trigger periods of heavy rainfall and even thunderstorms. Cities with tall buildings can also have a slight orographic effect (similar to hills) causing air to rise."
"Throughout the novel, Martine tries to fit her daughter into a perfect frame and be a certain person that Sophie tries to break away from. Although this is yet another way of bringing Sophie closer to her, Martine only pushes her away even further. When Marc asks Sophie what she wants to be, she says, \u201cI want to do dactylo, be a secretary\u201d (56). Martine, however, insists that, \u201cShe is too young now to know. You are going to be a doctor\u201d (56), indicating the tension between mother and daughter. Sophie and Martine are different people with different intentions. Even though Martine wants her daughter to grow up to be a doctor, Sophie never establishes the connection in which she takes into consideration being a doctor. Martine never seems to understand Sophie because she is too wrapped up in having the ideal daughter who doesn\u2019t go astray. Without explicitly saying it, it is obvious through the narrative voice that Sophie knows what she wants\u2014she ends up being a secretary. When Sophie returns to Haiti, Louise asks her, \u201cWhat do you do in America, Sophie? What is your profession?\u201d (99) to which Sophie responds, \u201cA secretary.\u201d (99)."
"Thirdly, some children develop anger and hatred towards the parent that\u2019s committing the adulterous act. They often feel that the cheating parent is responsible for the negative changes in themselves and for putting them on an emotional rollercoaster. This causes the child to isolate the erring parent even harboring resentment toward their parent for disrupting the family structure. The erring parent may feel the loyalty of the child has shifted but in reality, their actions have not only affected the innocent spouse but their child as well. Some children have even used the guilt of the erring parent as a way to gain material possessions from that one. Others have placed the blame squarely on the innocent parent trying to convince that one that because of some shortcomings they were the cause for the unfaithful mate\u2019s actions."
"Charles Elton is considered a pioneer in the field of invasion ecology. The diversity -invasibility hypothesis published in his book \u201cThe ecology of invasions by animals and plants\u201d (1958) had a great impact on future research (Richardson & Py?ek 2007) . Therein, he theorized that more diverse communities tend to be less invasible by alien species, as high species richness results in more effective use of the resources and an occupation of more niches which could potentially be invaded by exotics (Richardson & Py?ek 2006) ."
"Outside of curriculum, in 2014 I was selected to participate in the 23rd World Scout Jamboree to Japan in 2015, it enhanced me as a young adult. At the age of 14 I was given the task of fundraising ?3500, which propelled my independence and self-management. By learning how to communicate with 40,000 other people from all over the world I was able to adapt to language barriers by using different forms of communication. I regularly volunteer at scouts for younger people, this has allowed me to organise social events for families in scouts, conveying my man management. My volunteering attributes allow me to observe and manage behaviour. Helping alongside the leader with a child who needs extra support has openly exposed me to differentiation and the understanding to adapt to different scenarios. The need for health and safety and safeguarding in scouting has propelled my understanding of children\u2019s safety and how important it is. This understanding helped me to deduce my attitude in my work experience, by working in a private nursery for a week and two other infant schools for 6 weeks. I learnt that every child is different and requires different needs and it\u2019s up to the carer to provide those resources and support. This leads to my interest to study law, every person is different and obtains different goals and needs. Law is an imperative structure of society which needs to be addressed to every individual."
"Newly married couple can learn a lot from these teachers. According to the western concept, Family is an Institution where as our Indian concept believes that family is a way through which every one can perform their Dharma.. Dharma is supreme and it is the path in which mankind can do their duty and attain the salvation. In modern society the basics of a family is questioned and there are numerous problems are aroused."
"The 2011 Libyan civil war is an ongoing armed conflict in the North African state of Libya being fought between those seeking to depose Muammar Gaddafi and hold democratic elections, and pro-Gaddafi forces. Muammar Gaddafi has been the de-facto ruler of Libya since 1969 and has ruled the country without any election or a constitution. In late January, Jamal al-Hajji, a writer, political commentator called for demonstrations to be held in support of greater freedoms in Libya. He was arrested on 1 February."
"The family does have many strengths when it comes to helping with Son B. As stated in the Family Listening Project, the family works together when taking Son B to and from school, but they also have made a good strength at taking Son B to and from other places. When talking to the mother, she said, \u201cOur oldest son is good about helping us run to the store and get groceries if I am working or my husband is busy."
"If we said about racism , the first places that people will think is Europe . From the institutionalized racism , especially in colonial times , when racial beliefs were not considered something wrong , to recent times where the effects of neo-Nazism is still felt . Europe is a complex area with many cultures in a relatively small area of land . So that , people in Europe can have a conflict easily . Mostly , the conflict about racism such as racist other races ( think that his races is better than others and insult other races ). Besides that, European is divided into two level which are the rich and the poor. The rich discriminate the poor. For an example, there are high-class restaurants specially for the rich only. The rich would not have a meal with the poor. The rich had prejudice that the poor have high potential of committing crime and that they basically looked like criminal."
"Authors are able to make an impact on their readers and influence the way in which they comprehend and conduct themselves in the world. They achieve this by incorporating into their writing, themes that withstand the tests of time and hold true through generations. A theme is a message about life that an author wants the reader to understand. Author, Louis Sachar, brings to light the theme of friendship in his novel \u2018Holes\u2019. Friends have the ability to keep us mentally and physically strong, they help us weather lonely times and they improve the quality of our lives."
"While importing skilled workers could depress the wages of the native workers, the increased availability of their services would benefit the rest of the population. In the case of highly qualified migrants, it is apparent that they find it easier than the low skilled migrants to find employment but (Haque, 2002) argued that the job opportunities are better for those who speak English regardless of the skill or qualification level. (Dobson, 2001) found that from 1994, the annual net gain of professional and managerial foreign migrant workers in Birmingham was consistently above 25000 and from the year 2000, there are higher proportions of foreign-born workers in the more skilled occupational groups."
"Theodore Palivos has published 78 papers, most of which are about economical matters. The main purpose of the article is to show how illegal immigration is good for the host country by contributing to said countries economic growth and increasing their holdings of capital. By coming up with two equations that analyzed heterogeneous labor, wage, unemployment, and labor force to show that illegal immigration raises the welfare of domestic citizens . He also brings in many factors such as that there is less governmental control for such low paying factories so profit can grow more, and that the people working in these conditions do not strive for more because they cannot get a better job in their country."
"Finally, the episode ends with Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Address. On November 19, 1863 Lincoln delivered one of the most memorable speeches in American history. Lincoln declared the love he had for his people and his unwavering pursuit for equality in just 269 words. I never realized that this speech was just a \u201cside speech\u201d at a dedication ceremony. It is almost unbelievable that Lincoln thought that this was a failed speech considering that even today most Americans know at least the first line of the Gettysburg Address. It is a shame that the photographer was not able to capture him delivering his speech, it would have been a great image to reflect upon today."
"The connotation of childhood is ignorance and innocence although that innocence is corrupted with the last two lines of the first stanza in which the speaker mentions that the \u201chasty pits were filling with bulldozed corpses\u201d. The use of such harsh terms are employed by the child because that information was obtained from the newspapers. By having read the newspaper and discovering the reality of a dangerous situation, childhood ignorance has been put aside and terrifying reality is put forth. Atwood further demonstrates in what manner reading the newspaper is dangerous when she refers to the game of \u201cstepping on the cracks\u201d but instead of \u2018breaking your mother\u2019s back\u2019, it \u201cdetonated red bombs\u201d."
"The current project identified nine major supporting characteristic\u00a0competencies. The research study has six major characteristics but nine competencies that reflect the need for marital and family therapists to be skilled proficiently in core. Marital and family therapy service providers were suggested to be prepared to use large ranges of clinical tactics within counseling with couples and families. The study specifies the common influence in change of therapeutics, understanding empathy and listening (Hovestadt, Fenell, & Canfield, 2002). The author says the six major characteristics are as follows: (1) Effectual proficient skills in Marriage and Family Therapy, (2) Small town understanding, being thankful, and Enthusiastic response, (3) Personal Characteristics and Flexibility, (4) Generalist a Non-specialization Organization, (5) Education, Training, and Skills in Marital Family Therapy (MFT) and (6) Using Formal and Informal rganization Resources ( Hovestadt, Fenell, & Canfield, 2002)."

"Thorr Motors Simulation Heather Sanchez MKT/421 July 20, 2011 Theodore Framan Perceptual maps help to improve a company\u2019s current product on the market by mapping consumer expectation of the product. The motorcycle company Thorr Motors perceptual maps were used to create a marketing plan to aid in maintaining a high brand image of their motorcycles. This paper is based on the three phases in the Thorr Motors simulation. The situation, recommended solutions, and result for each phase will be discussed. Lastly, the different marketing components addressed in the simulation will be summarized."
"Officially there is no racism in the United States in the sense that all kinds of racial discriminations are prohibited by law. But racism still exists to some extent in the hearts of the people. In general, there is a reduction in the prejudices people have about others based on their race or other similar social background. But these prejudices have not completely died down. A large portion of US citizens still appear to have racial prejudices to different degrees."
"Because, the parents of both kind of children are one , so both kind of children inherit same bad traits of their parents, and both got rebellious nature and polluted souls then they both will be treated equally. But it does not happen and illegitimate children are treated discriminately, which is truly wrong to the essence of justice. At one side in Islamic ethics the good nourishment of children is considering as an obligatory moral action, and on the other hand the factors which can play supportive roles in the better nourishment of illegitimate child are prevented and forbidden to him/her."
"Although slavery greatly restricted the ability of Africans in America to practice their cultural traditions, many practices, values and beliefs survived and over time have incorporated elements of European American culture. There are even certain facets of African American culture that were brought into being or made more prominent as a result of slavery; an example of this is how drumming became used as a means of communication and establishing a community identity during that time. The result is a dynamic, creative culture that has had and continues to have a profound impact on mainstream American culture and on world culture as well."
"He explains this to his children, \u201c\u2018I want you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It\u2019s when you know you\u2019re licked before you even begin, but you begin anyways and you see it through no matter what.\u201d Atticus respects Mrs. Dubose for her courage as much as Mrs. Dubose respects Atticus for his wisdom and good advice. Atticus thinks when Tim Johnson had shot that rabid dog that does not make him brave. Also, Atticus wisdom never gives up during the trial. During his closing statement he says to the jury, \u201cA court is only as sound as its jury, and a jury is only as sound as the men who make it up. I am confident that you gentlemen will review without passion the evidence you have heard, come to a decision, and restore this defendant to his family."
"Homosexuality has been around and recorded for a very long time. Even though today, there is more leeway about homosexuality., this does not mean that society has approved of the LGBT community, presently or historically. Even in the United States, we still see the LGBT community terrorized almost every day. Up until the 1970s, it was against the law to identify as LGBT. If you were caught often times you were institutionalized, and some were even found to be lobotomized. One doctor famous for performing lobotomies on the LGBT was named Dr. Walter J. Freeman. He became famous for his perfection of the \u201cIce Pick Lobotomy,\u201d and it is believed that out of his 4,000 patients he performed these lobotomies on, 40 percent were homosexuals."
"The research done in this article shows that men or women with low income jobs and less resources are more likely to be violent in their home as a means to gain the lack of power in their life. Men who have fewer resources then there female partners will be more likely to commit domestic assault than the men with resources equal or greater than their female partners (Anderson, 1995). We can see for the research done by Anderson that she focuses on the reporting of violence. I would have like to have seen some numbers on education and or employment in ration to domestic violence."
"If the criminal kills someone and then he is killed afterward for his crime then it means that we, as the community, have failed to recognize his value as a human being. Marshall says that killing someone is just wrong. Regardless of their crime, putting someone to death is just a \u2018cruel and unusual punishment. \u2019 We human beings are made from flesh and bone and neither one of us has the right to take away anyone\u2019s life. Whereas, Leiser thinks that if a criminal takes away someone\u2019s life, then it should be done to them also."
"The other perceptual error apparent in this study is the halo effect. The Halo effect occurs when one general impression toward a person\u2019s characteristics distorts our perception of other characteristics of that person. This error always occurs when someone is focusing only on one information and not looking for other information. We use general information of the person to fill in the missing information. In this case, when Mr.Gilman offers her a vacant position of market research coordinator and increases her salary. She declines his offers because she only knows the general information regarding the market research coordinator is the technical support of the organization, a \u201cbackroom\u201d job, far removed from the company\u2019s bottom-line activities. Furthermore, she thinks that Mr.Gilman is trying to downgrade her as a woman that could not go any further to work in top-level management. She also has experience with her previous employer of brand management and stated that the women could not take the heat in brand management and placed women in technical support in brand management."
"Securing information systems in the last decade has become more apparent and malicious than ever before due to the ever-expanding internet. Cyber-crime is any type of crime that involves a computer or a computer network used for malicious or harmful purposes. Cyber-crime comes in all shapes and sizes and can cause different problems ranging from not being able to access resources to the entire computer network crashing. There has been a spike in cyber-crime on the internet due to the loose regulations, lack of laws governing internet and computer use, and growing popularity in online markets posing a risk for millions."
"The problems all start with stereotypes. Many people still believe the horrible things people said about black people in the past century, many view them as illegals, stupid, dangerous people. These stereotypes all play into what happens with police brutality. Groups are even starting to form to go against this, including groups like \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d or other groups trying to get their message out about the injustice of police brutality."
"Considering one of his studies conducted at a public elementary school with 800 children, children who claim to have imaginary friends concentrate better in school. Although all of the above is true, children\u2019s intensified relationships with their imaginary friend could be a cue that they need reassurance from the people who are the most important to them. Children need reassurance from the people that they will continue to be a part of their life and that the people can help the children with them problems."
"It can be seen that Iago is to blame for the tragedy however; he just played the part of the devil\u2019s advocate. Iago is to blame but he could have not achieved his plan without remaining reliant on the others to play there part in his game. It was his manipulation and somewhat integrity on others which caused the distrust between the friends. The plan succeeded with a twist, as the other characters did not try and prevent suspicion or jealousy because there was no communication amongst them besides talking to Iago, who turned them against one another. This tragedy could have been prevented by talking to each other and prevent stirring up any unwanted lies."
"In William Shakespeare\u2019s play Romeo and Juliet, Juliet is shaped in a positive way by external forces as well because the encounters that she and Romeo have because they cause her to go from a na\u00efve, obedient girl to a mature, self-assured woman. In the opening act of the play, Lady Capulet asks Juliet if she can accept Paris\u2019 love. Juliet responds that she\u2019ll try to \u201clike if looking liking move,\u201d but she won\u2019t fall for him more than her mother\u2019s \u201cconsent gives strength to make it fly,\u201d showing us that she is still too immature to make her own decisions and immature overall (1.3.99-101). She also shows us that she is childish in the way she thinks when she says that marriage \u201cis an honor\u201d that she doesn\u2019t think about (1.3.66). But after encountering Romeo, we see her adopt a more adult persona. For example, during the balcony scene, Juliet says that the love they have for each other is \u201ctoo like lightning\u201d and that it is a \u201cbud of love\u201d still under \u201csummer\u2019s ripening breath\u201d and the next time they meet, the flower will be beautiful, showing us that Juliet is mature enough to recognize that she is going too fast and recommends that the both of them take things slower."
"An example might be that you will hear from the majority of young adults, \u201cl want to make a lot of money and retire early\u2019, but an older adult might say, \u201cMoney is not everything; as long as you stay healthy you will be happy. Another phrase that I hear quite a bit is to enjoy my youth and to see the world efore I get old. My Grandmother still tells me that to this day. Her belief is that once you reach a certain age when the aches and pains of aging begin you will lose your desire to be more active. Older people seem to get set in their ways and typically resist change. They get comfortable with a certain pattern in their lives and do not like this pattern disturbed. They have no tolerance for anything new. My Grandparents are a good example of how change is very difficult."
"Lives of African Americans between 1877 and 1928 and Effects of Industrialization The lives of African Americans between 1877 and 1928 were marked with sufferings as well as attempts to liberalize themselves and achieve civil rights. The era of reconstruction ended in 1876 and so the period between 1877 and 1928 marks the period after reconstruction and also includes the period during the First World War. It is an era marked by inequality and injustices against the African Americans as well as efforts by the African Americans to achieve equality and bring an end to injustices."
"Of course, the British responded in haste and with a touch of anger; they \u201cdrafted a sharp note to the U.S. government[\u2026] they demanded the release of the commissioners and an explanation. A seven-day limit was set for reply\u201d (\u201cTrent Affair,\u201d 2007). Such an outcome would have proven critical to the Union. Furthermore, Britain \u201cdecided to ostentatiously make war preparations and announced an embargo on exports of saltpetre, the main ingredient of gunpowder, to America\u201d (Putnis, 2004) so it was obvious that the British meant to take the incident quite seriously."
"Dodgson, author of the children\u2019s classics \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland\u201d and \u201cThrough the Looking-Glass.\u201d Carroll wastes no time in introducing the first character in this strange, yet satirically familiar world.\u00a0 In the second paragraph of the book, as the youthful Alice passes the time lazily in a world of seemingly perpetual springtime, she sees the White Rabbit, a hurried and nervous figure who consults his pocket-watch and determines aloud that he is late.\u00a0 Clearly, the characters of Alice, the child, and White Rabbit, the adult, lie in stark contrast to one another. One has nothing to do but laze about and daydream, the other in a frenzied rush to be somewhere.\u00a0 The fact that Alice follows the rabbit is a simple ode to childish curiosity.\u00a0 The fact that she falls down a dark and deep hole could be symbolic of how children often get in over their heads when they give in to curiosity.\u00a0 However, once Alice realizes that she is not falling quickly, rather floating in a slow descent, she takes the time to closely examine and consider her new surroundings with impressive presence of mind.\u00a0 So, here we have a young girl, in the midst of complete chaos, using her reason, remaining calm and displaying a more mature sense than the supposedly elder rabbit.\u00a0 Alice\u2019s trip down the rabbit hole, though it only encompasses four pages, is a telling introduction to the novel\u2019s heroine and the beginning of a wild ride."
"Dana and Rufus\u2019 kinship starts to dwindle we progress throughout the story, and it hits its low point when Rufus tries to exert absolute control over Dana. When he sells a slave out of jealousy for simply having a conversation with Dana, it shows that Rufus wishes to enforce his growing love for Dana on her and their relationship shifts from one belonging of a parent and child as mentioned before to one formed over Rufus\u2019 lust for power and dominance. Alice, Rufus\u2019 mistress and the mother to his child Hagar, confirms his love for Dana when she notes that he likes \u201cher in bed, Dana out of bed, and people say that they look alike\u2026guess that means they\u2019re two halves of the same woman, in his crazy head\u201d (206)."
"to look at poverty from a world-wide perspective. Mahatma Gandhi said, \u201cPoverty is the worst form of violence.\u201d All across the world, this violence is real, and to many, a way of life. The poverty line is much lower in some other countries due to an uneven distribution of wealth. In the USA, the wealthy middle class brings the median up and causes the poverty threshold to be higher. However, different factors such as the level and trend of poverty and inequality amongst nations, along with considerable detail on the sources of market incomes and public policies are used to compare poverty levels from nation to nation (Smeeding, 2006, p. 69). With that said, absolute poverty is much more rampant in some other countries than it is in the United States."
"Hallena was born just a few days before my birthday, and in some ways it felt like I also had the gift of a little sister to play with. I noticed one hand behind my mum\u2019s back and thought, finally, the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for. I closed my eyes tightly as the gift was placed in my hands. \u2018Hmm, something soft and fluffy\u2019, I opened my eyes, looked down and saw the most adorable little teddy bear ever."
"Individual get a greater sense of accomplishment in the activity, being focused upon ,resulting in heightened self worth. Provided that drama is a social art form, active engagement in dramatic activity can result in positive social outcomes like sense of belonging to a group. A major problem encountered in any discussion concerning special needs is that of terminology. By categorising young people under the heading of special needs\u2019 we are in danger of implying that they are in some way similar, whereas, in truth, the specificity of their needs may make them a wildly disparate group or individuals, and that their needs are grounded in some deficit on the part of the individual, rather than resting in the educational system . Most usually, this occurs as a result of one, or a complex combination of any of the following:"
"They burnt objects and threw them inside the inn, where many of the police men were. The multitude acted in outrageous ways and fought against the members of the police. The police had never been confronted by the gay community, they were not used to that, so they were running away and asking for help. Members of the LGBT community jumped on cars and protested for their rights and against the violation of them."
"Coming from nothing I do not carry much on my body just my dagger and my white purse. I do not indulge in spending my wealth on personal belongs, I prefer to spend it on things that cause greater pleasure in life. Though, gold and cloaks may seem nice for someone\u2019s appearance along with getting respect from others based on looks. I choose to spend my wealth on things that come from the world to nourish myself along with others and bring true happiness. I made a name for myself by working my way up in status starting as a sheriff."
"There is only one success\u2026 to be able to spend your life in your own way, and not to give others absurd maddening claims upon it. This quote by Christopher Morley describes what is really meant by personal success. Personal success has to do with being happy. One can only be truly happy if they are happy and secure with themselves. Personal success is about being yourself and not being afraid to do so. It is about not letting others dictate your life or make you feel that you have to change who you are. It is about gaining self confidence and maintaining it."
"There are many ways to show communication between people. From verbal to non-verbal types of communication, Junior displays these traits throughout the book. He has a special connection with Rowdy that they don\u2019t have to have a verbal conversation to understand each other. They both understand what they each other are thinking just by a look. During the basketball game, they both knew what each other were playing for and what the game meant for them."
"This will, in turn, enable operations run more smoothly, hopefully avoiding police abuse problems in the future. Methods must be implemented which effectively deal with police who tend to cross the line, from simple situations to serious firearm use or prejudice. Some of the solutions, particularly the policy changes, will be met with controversy and will be difficult to implement. Keeping track of police actions is the next step in self-protection. There have been thousands of reported incidents of police misconduct in the countless cities throughout the nation, and probably thousands more that transpire without any mention. Law enforcement officers in the United States have been granted powerful authority to assist them in serving and protecting the people of this country."
"If any school had dared to use an African American as their sports team mascot, it would bring massive controversy. To prove this, a group of students at the University of Northern Colorado nicknamed their team the \u201cFightin\u2019 Whites\u201d. This was quickly deemed extremely inappropriate, just as the use of any race in a nickname should. If one is against racism, they must be against it in all types, regardless of if it\u2019s about African Americans or Native Americans, and the use of a mascot in this way is incredibly racist."
"Obama at the Wakefield High School speech in Sept 2009, said that his biggest inspiration came from Mahatma Gandhi. It was when a question posed on him as \u2018who was the one person, dead or alive, that he would choose to dine with?\u2019 and his quick reply was \u2018Gandhi!\u2019. He continued and said that \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019s somebody I find a lot of inspiration in. He inspired Dr. King with his message of nonviolence. He ended up doing so much and changed the world just by the power of his ethics\u201d."
"It is important as a practitioner that you ensure the children you work with are learning and playing in an inclusive environment as they all have a right to a broad and balanced curriculum. They also have a right to have equal access to the curriculum regardless of background, race, culture, gender, needs or disability. It is also imperative that you ensure you are aware of the needs of all the children you work with for example if they have EAL or SEN, if they are new to the school, if they have a different culture or ethnicity or if they are in foster care. You need to allow children to have equal opportunities as it is part of their human rights \u2013 all children have a right to play and learn together. It is important that all children are not discriminated against in any way \u2013 if this happens you need to make sure that the correct measures are used to deal with the problem and prevent it from happening again. It is essential that all children are allowed to participate in activities that will broaden their horizons i.e. school outings."
"My favorite part about Halloween is wearing costumes! It\u2019s the one day of the year where you can really express yourself and just be happy, or so I thought. This year I decided to wear my awesome Rainbow Dash costume, hoping to spread some kind of message. However, when I walked into class, hardly anyone was wearing a costume! It felt so awkward sitting in class with a ridiculously colorful costume, with brightly colored wings while taking a math test! It just felt like an embarrassingly ordinary school day! On the other hand, there were a lot of stories on the news about people wearing inappropriate costumes ruining their career or studies."
"However, this was tough time for the black African American community and the catholic community as extremist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan were created as they openly racist towards these groups. Segregation got to the point where black people weren\u2019t even allowed in the same restaurant or bus, making this so difficult for the community to live their lives. Showboat was not shown in the south during this time as it would not have been accepted with the amount of racism during that time."
"In a context of American multiculturalism, Portes and Rumbaut did a longitudinal survey from the early to mid 1990 \u2018s on 2nd coevals immigrant young person from a assortment of groups, crossing Asiatic, Latin American and Caribbean states. From their findings they developed the theory of metameric assimilation. They theorised that because of assorted factors, groups either assimilated downwards into poorness, into the mainstream \u201c white \u201d in-between category, or upwards but within their cultural group."
"It has been reported that both had gone into an altercation, which led officer Slager to shoot Scott eight times from the back. The controversy is that officer Slager claimed that Scott had taken his taser. There was an eyewitness, Feidon Santana, who was present at the shooting and claimed that Scott did not grab the police\u2019s taser."
"For our ideas about global diversity to become a reality, it is imperative that we recognize that global diversity is more about a global way of behaving and thinking and less of a personal definition of diversity. Globalization is quickly changing the landscape of the corporate and business world. For long term success, the way we assess and define diversity and inclusion should drastically change because diversity in a global context focuses on finding shared ideals and values and implementing them into our personal and professional lives."
"Each race has not only specific distinguishing body features- skin color, hair texture, nose shape, and so forth- but specific character qualities that cannot be erased; they may be suppressed, but eventually they will come out. These qualities are cultural aspects, such as language, citizen, religion, child rearing practices, food habits clothing, and so forth. (Paul Spickard, Race and Nation, 2005) Language One finds the word, \u201clanguage\u201d used to refer to a complex and dynamic system of conventional symbols that is used in various modes for thought and communication (qtd in COMA 104 notes)."
"In recent years, by the development of science, the 3rd sex, homosexuality, is found, beside the traditional concept of sex is only 2 sex, female and male. They are known as LGBT which symbols for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, respectively. The marriage of these kinds of people is called \u201csame-sex marriage\u201d which is becoming the hot phrase in the searching tab. In theoretical definition, Same-sex marriage is also known as gay marriage or a homosexual marriage which is a ceremonial union of two people of the same sex; a marriage or marriage-like relationship between two women or two men (US Legal, I."
"Kids often want to know whether you studied hard or not and why you did it, for them your answer is going to be the way they want to do it. From my point of view there are many people who can teach your children, but no one can do what parents can. Nowadays parents have to take their roll, and realize that whether they want it or not, they are teachers. I have a teacher that always says \u201cmonkeys see, monkeys do\u201d I would like to ask you ?what kind of education do you want to give to your children?"
"3 Here are guidelines to help you play the interview game to win: 4 Present yourself as a winner. Instantly, the way you dress, speak, and move gives the interviewer more information about you than you would think possible. You doubt that this is true? Consider this: a professional Job recruiter, meeting a series of Job applicants, was asked to signal the moment he decided not to hire each applicant. The thumbs-down decision was often made in less than forty-five secondseven efore the applicant thought the interview had begun. 5 How can you keep from becoming a victim of an instant \u201cno\u201d decision? * Dress appropriately. This means business clothing: usually a suit and tie or a conservative dress or skirt suit. Don\u2019t wear casual student clothing. On the other hand, don\u2019t overdress: you\u2019re going to a Job interview, not a party. If you\u2019re not sure what\u2019s considered appropriate business attire, do some spying before the interview. Walk past your prospective place of employment at lunch or quitting time and check out how the employees are dressed."
"They share their hard times and the good, their victories and their defeats, but most importantly they share a common dream. That dream is of having \u201ca little house and a couple of acres an\u2019 a cow and some pigs an\u2019 live off the fatta the lan'(14), where Lennie can take care of the rabbits just as George has been taking care of him over the years. Lennie is constantly thinking and worrying about the rabits."
"The only reason Jefferson was arrested was because of his upbringing. On the day Jefferson was in the store and was arrested, he chose to steal the money and whiskey. He knew he wasn\u2019t supposed to but he was in shock and did not have any money to his name."
"The problem of identity theft has become one of the fastest emerging phenomenal crimes in America and has inevitably been increasing exponentially worldwide (McDonald, 2006). It is a fraudulent act of acquiring the legally certified personal identifiers and other personal information essential to carry out impersonation to obtain merchandises, services and crimes (McDonald, 2006). And being a high-reward low-risk activity and an equal-opportunity crime, it could victimize anyone regardless of age, class and race (McDonald, 2006)."
"To conclude the point whether \u2018The World\u2019s Wife\u2019 shows no sympathy for men , it is undeniable that many poems in the collection portray men in negative lights; often through both their personality and looks. Duffy wrote \u2018the World\u2019s Wife\u2019 in order to give women who have been metaphorically silent in both history and stories a voice; and by doing so she had to undermine the status of the male characters in order to elevate women."
"Still people believed this is the best suitable way to control their children. This has been used continuously because they agreed that this is part of their culture, traditions and religion. They have a lot of rules. In addition, such rules apply to every aspect of their child\u2019s life and behaviors. For example, telling and forcing their children to do certain things that they don\u2019t wish to do or force them to study subjects that their children do not have pay any interest.Therefore, most children who grown up under the authoritarian style of parenting suffer from low self esteem and inferiority issues. Since their opinions are never valued or acknowledge at home, they become afraid of sharing their feelings, ideas and opinions. Since their behavior is never rewarded but punished. This causes problems in building emotional relationship later in life since they see everyone around them as being similar to what they see at home. These kids consequently end up having a higher chance of being more susceptible to drug use.In some countries like North America by some parents who have been raised by very controlling or Authoritarians style may adopt their kid by Authoritative parenting. They may adopt their child with a parenting style that is very chilled and easy on kid. This is called Permissive parenting style. They want to be more friendly rather than being a parent. They may feel that control and discipline may harm their relationship with their children. This kind of parenting style lack structure, and the parents usually do not use schedule to go inorder like systematiclly. This style is typified by parents having a very friendly attitude with their children. The parents do not behave like parents; on the contrary, they behave more like friends with their kids. It is also involving minimal or no parental control over the children. The parents have low or no conflicts with their children. Instead they give much freedom to the children and adored by their kids in their kind of parenting style, and thus they agree to whatever their kids say or demands. They don\u2019t want their kids to get upset.Furthermore, in Southern African countries like in South Sudan, the parents seem to not give their child a good care as their parents have to go for work in order to survive. If they did not go for a day the whole family is going to starve. In some cases, parents may be so wrapped up in their own problems for instinct being overworked, coping with depression, struggling with substance abuse; that they actually fail to see how uninvolved they are with their children or are simply unable to provide the emotional support that their children need. Due to the lack of emotional responsiveness and love from their parents, children raised by uninvolved parents may have difficulty in later life. The complete lack of boundaries in the home makes it difficult to learn appropriate behaviors and other social situations, which is why children with uninvolved parents are more likely to misbehave.In addition, there is another type of parenting which is known as Helicopter Parenting. It is a style of parents who are over focused on their children,\u201d says Carolyn Deitch, Ph.D., director of the Center for the Treatment of Anxiety Disorders near Detroit and author of Anxiety Disorders: The Go-To Guide. Rearch have shown that one out of three hundred college students suffer from dispersion and anxiety due to excessive worry the parents hold for their child. We can see the backlash from parental guidance affect the child\u2019s behaviors.SolutionsIn this paragraph I will be mentioning about how to prevent the negative effect of parenting. These are some ways that can be used: Have faith in your parenting skills Trust your child\u2019s basic good nature Allowing any experience to be acceptable (Deborah Godfrey, Mar 25, 2014)Uncertainty in your parenting will lead to inconsistent this is because the parent does not have confidence in their skills of parenting. If parents have problems of setting limits or helpless please don\u2019t harsh your children, if you think you are being this kind, you can solve these through classes, books or even research using internet. Nobody on this planet has perfect parenting skills but still if your parenting skills are just good enough then most problems you are having with your kids will be solved.All kids are born to make you happy and proud which is their basic nature however most parents do not realize that they are training them the exact opposite. When children are young and love to help, do you encourage them and allow for age appropriate achievement to be good enough or do you expect more from them then to work more? This is what happens when they get older for example at TEENAGER. You cannot force them to do things that are not capable for their age such as telling them to study certain subjects in school. If you want them to do what you want you have to explain why, and then if they tend to have lack of interest let them be. They will choose their own path.What the child needs is a space to do the right thing! (Debbie Godfrey, 2019, Positive Parenting). So, if your child makes or about to make a mistake don\u2019t stop them or pull them unless it\u2019s a life dangerous situation, just let them go with a flow this will teach them a life lesson. WE ALL LEARN FROM OUR MISTAKES (Liliana Daza). This is the quote that is always bared in my mind and will never forget it because it\u2019s very true in my own view.Final ConclusionIn my personal perspective, I believe that children behaviors vary due to different parenting styles. Throughout my entire life, I have experienced that children\u2019s social, emotional, and academic behaviors alters as a result of parental guidance. My parents seem to use authoritarian style which was awful but as soon as I started to work on this project, I realized the techniques that will improve our relationship between me and my parents. The thing I did was I presented to them and show them why am I behaving like this with a solution to it. I also showed that how is done by a video about parenting styles effects on the child. As a result of that, they then know and slightly start to be an authoritative parent; therefore, I can see the difference between then now. I now talk to them openly and discuss about and can see a lot of improvements in test results. Finally, in my perceptive I think different parenting gives different outcomes and affects the child\u2019s behavior in several ways. This is the end of the report as mentioned before please, please do not smack your kids or shout. There are a lot of solutions to solve"
"As a first time father he was very overwhelmed at first but he began to realize that his wife needed him the most for emotional support. He become involved by going with her to her doctor\u2019s appointment, rubbing her feet and cooking when she became very tired to stand on her feet. Involvement during pregnancy are very important to development."
"The word \u201calbinism\u201d refers to a group of inherited conditions. People with albinism have little or no pigment in their eyes, skin, or hair. They have inherited genes that do not make the usual amounts of a pigment called melanin. One person in 17,000 has some type of albinism. Albinism affects people from all races. Most children with albinism are born to parents who have normal hair and eye color for their ethnic backgrounds. Albinism is found on the eleventh chromosome, section q, loci 14-21."
"Course of action in Gray and Black No. 1 was likewise an intense creative explanation, particularly to the eyes of Victorian watchers. At the point when the depiction was first displayed at London\u2019s Royal Academy in 1872, gatherings of people were bewildered. Contrasted with the exceedingly completed surfaces and thick, beautiful arrangements more common of Academy works of art, Whistler\u2019s picture is significantly pared down. To nineteenth century groups of onlookers, Whistler\u2019s depiction looked incomplete, and the setting appeared to be unimaginably vacant. Indeed, even today, the room in which Whistler represented his mom is striking in its exposed state\u2014and its geometric normality. It is all straight lines and right edges: striped floor covering, box-molded stool, dim wood framing, and surrounded prints (of Whistler\u2019s own etchings) on the dividers."
"Later on, Aunt Alexandra is entertaining the Maycomb Missionary Society at the Finch home and they are debating the harshness of the \u2018squalid lives of the Mrunas\u2019 led by Mrs Meriweather. There is irony in the ladies\u2019 conversation in that there are blacks in their own society living in similar conditions. Harper Lee brings this to the reader\u2019s attention by Mrs Merriweather\u2019s use of alliteration in \u2018sin and squalor\u2019 which is then repeated for effect. This again shows social prejudice on blacks because the \u2018s\u2019 is harsh sounding which suggests that the blacks have low morals which the whites think are not even worth knowing of."
"A slight beat of his heart then suddenly formed in his mind, it were like memories of him and the girl in front of him, how that happened, he didn\u2019t know. A zombie wasn\u2019t supposed to remember or feel anything. Knowing that he was a zombie, he was also not supposed to feel anything but he knew he did. Villaruel regained his human like with the help of Faith. Not medicine, not knowledge, but love; it was love that make him feel a bit again, not fully but a good start for him. Only later then he found out that the man\u2019s heart that has been used in his operation was Faith\u2019s boyfriend who loved her so much. Maybe that explained why Villaruel felt something for her, the love of her boyfriend collided with his present memories, making him see and feel that thing he called LOVE."

", 1990). Some may conjecture that regardless of how great parents social displaying is and regardless of how sustaining and steady guardians are, ecological hazard components may exceed great child-rearing for the kids to even now create conduct issues. Even though we know about India\u2019s high recurrence of savagery and vicious violations among young people, we don\u2019t realize in the case of child-rearing, family and school condition assumes a job in the advancement of such results and if it does, to what degree it might be."
"In my opinion if the Christian concerned was a Church of England Christian then there would certainly be times when they could justify an abortion. Although they would never see it as good, it could be justified in some occasions. It is seen as a sad and tragic fact of life, which should be minimised as much as possible. In the C of E\u2019s view abortion could be justified after rape, to enable the victim to recover, when the foetus is severely damaged, because its prospects are immense suffering and usually an early death, or if the mother\u2019s life is in danger. Here abortion is justified under \u2018the lesser of two evils\u2019. Meaning that it\u2019s not a good thing to kill the foetus, which may not even be alive, but it is better than killing the mother, who is definitely alive."
"Most of the African employees were repeatedly disciplined for not meeting the production necessities. Eventually, they were fired; non-African workers were not subjected to the same criticism.

"We have acknowledged through many texts and the experience of our fellow officers that police work is a very mundane profession.

Unfortunately, police interventions in domestic violence cases still lack a proactive response."
"Also the name of the character you must take note of Pumblechook it brings to my mind a picture of a clown or someone who is not entirely competent at what ever he is doing. All theses ways are ways in which Charles Dickens has made you feel right from the start something odd about uncle Pumblechook even before you met him and heard what he had to say. This is how through exaggeration of description Charles Dickens shows distain for a character."
"In the year 2013, the most important lesson I learned in my life is to gain happiness. Despite of all challenges, trials, past memories, unexpected thing, random people you met in your life that leaves a mark and to the people who leaves you, always remember that some people go but some people replace in your life. There is one person who will change your poor attitude, accepts all your flaws and still love you whatever your past is."

"As a consequence of this act, many Chinese were criminalized and suffered immense racial discrimination and violence. In the face of the American public, the Chinese were seen as inferior and unworthy. Because of this, thousands of Chinese immigrants, as well as Chinese owned businesses and residences were assaulted and expelled from various towns. In only two years time since the Chinese Exclusion Act had been enacted, the population of Chinese immigrants had dwindled to the number of 75,000. Additionally, American-born Chinese were no exception to the prejudice that resulted from the Chinese Exclusion Act. Many born Chinese-Americans as well as the Chinese immigrants who remained post-exclusion worked hard to assimilate and better themselves to fit into American society, but they were no match for how deeply the consequences of the exclusion act would affect their lives."
"The rise in the abortion rate as seen in the U.S is an indirect indicator that women have gained power. An unwanted pregnancy no longer stops a woman from pursuing her education or career. Most of all, she has control of her sexuality and identity. The medical practitioners are also winners in this debate as they have a major influence on abortion decisions. \u2018The abortion debate is, and always has been, defined by the changing connections between the issue and other social and cultural divides in the American social fabric. It is in the end, a surprisingly empty vessel into which movements, politicians, and regular Americans have poured their anxieties and concerns.'(Ziad Munson). More research should be done to identify perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors of people towards the abortion debate. The constructed dichotomous approach should break down to let other viewpoints be incorporated or allowed to spring up."
"A forced marriage differs from an arranged marriage where the arranged marriage will be done with the consent of both spouses to involve a third party in it while forced marriage does not. In this matter, it clearly can be seen that most underage marriages are forced marriage. This statement is strengthened by Miller\u2019s (2015) explanation that child marriage could be claimed as forced marriage since they are minors and presumed unable of giving informed consent. She further explained that extreme involuntary marriage may include other things such as abduction, threats, rape, imprisonment, and even death."
"While western societies marked the end of childhood at a certain age. In western societies childhood is from birth until one reached the age of majority which differs from country to country. In Africa, children go through various rites of passages before attaining adulthood. Although most African societies practice rite of passages others do not by the marked the end of childhood at a certain age, for example, South Africa and Zimbabwe. According to Unicef (2005) defined childhood as, \u201ca time for children to be in school and at play, to grow strong and confident with the love and encouragement of their families and extended community of caring adults\u2026 space between birth and the attainment of adulthood."
"Another great way to try and be more optimistic is to create an imaginary \u2018movie\u2019 of your life in your mind. Think about how you feel, how you look, what accomplishments you have, what you do, and what your life is like. Then set aside a few seconds each day to play this movie in your mind. This is a simple but effective mental training exercise which will instantly boost your mood and change the way you think about yourself and your future."
"Hence respect can be called as a behavioral component. A person inadvertently judges the other on the basis of the expressed behavior and qualities possessed by him. Respect is also an expression of accepting a certain trait or set of traits demonstrated by that person. The qualities or traits that we appreciate, we tend to respect those who own them. So, respecting a person or not comes naturally. Every person has his own standards of judging people. Yet, there are certain set of qualities that are common and popular to gain respect in the society. An individual who possess high moral values and shows compassion and solidarity towards other human beings is respected by a large section of society. Then there are other traits like general behavior, reaction, response and a personal growth etc. All these factors contribute to effectively comprehend the term \u2018respect\u2019. It is a natural response or reaction towards an individual."
"During the Hellenistic period, women, such as Hypatia, obtained honorary recognition for their skills in expressing their thoughts and opinions through poetry. Most of the time, the contents of their literature were related to their desire to possess equal outlook on both genders. The presence of Hellenistic monarchies provided the new outlook played by monarchical wives \u2013 the Hellenistic queens. The upper-class women society enjoyed the vast newly opened opportunities since they were the ones who can avail the new places in society, such as education, political career, etc."
"We need to be saying what are we teaching our children? But in the end these children are going to end up with a lifetime full of jail time and crime abuse. But how do we prevent this? Many programs have arose in the last ten years such as The boys and girls club, Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, Ameri Corps, D.A.R.E, and school activities such as athletics, drill teams, drama, cheer teams, academic clubs, etc. All of these contribute to kids getting and staying off the streets, prolonging drug abuse, and minimizing gang affiliation."
"Some serial killers and other violent individuals believe that they will never be caught. Others think that they are doing God\u2019s work, or they cite other \u2018important\u2019 reasons for the killings and violent acts that they partake in. Sometimes this is due to mental disorders, but there are other reasons that people commit acts of this nature."

It was \u2018lection day, and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn\u2019t too drunk to get there; but when they told me there was a State in this country where they\u2019d let that n[ ] vote, I drawed out. I says I\u2019ll never vote agin \u2018(Twain 28). This displays a factual part of history."

My mom deserves this.\u201d Mountains weren\u2019t tall, The roads weren\u2019t long, and the Sun wasn\u2019t bright. When I requested my mom to collect the prize, I was the best son in the world."
"Opponents of immigration often claim that immigrants, particularly those who are unauthorized, are much more likely than US natives to commit crimes and they pose a hazard to public protection. However there is little evidence to reinforce those claims. In fact, studies overwhelmingly indicates that immigrants are much less likely than similar US natives to execute violent crimes, and that regions with more immigrants have similar or lower fees of violent and property crimes than areas with fewer immigrants. There are enormously few research particularly of criminal behavior among unauthorized immigrants, however the limited research shows that these immigrants additionally have a lower propensity to devote crime than their native-born peers, although in all likelihood a better propensity than prison immigrants. Evidence about legalization packages is consistent with those findings, indicating that a legalization software reduces crime costs. Meanwhile, accelerated border enforcement, which reduces unauthorized immigrant inflows, has mixed outcomes on crime rates. A legalization application or other similar initiatives no longer currently below serious attention have greater capability to improve public safety and protection than numerous other regulations that have recently been proposed or implemented."

"It should be noted the special role of Community Service, it acts as one of the most common ways to attract students to socially useful work. The organization of public works has certain advantages over other methods of combating environmental pollution. First of all, the amounts that people employed are significantly higher than benefits. It is also important that the moral and psychological state of people performing public works is much better than that of those who are not at all busy. Certain benefits in this form of employment are for enterprises. The funds were spent for our socially beneficial activities for the benefit of nature. Consider further what constitutes our social work.What we learned during the project, is that every human being has to treat our nature right. Most of the ways in which a person harms the environment develop over several years, some events can occur in an instant, but this instant will have far-reaching consequences."
"When I was growing up she constantly made sure I had everything I needed for school, even if she couldn\u2019t afford it because she had three more children too.

"Endo\u2019s novel on the other hand does convey strong racial themes but to the reader there are also issues relating to ethnic bias which in some parts tends to overwhelm the intentional matter of racism.

We regularly took part in charity for orphanage, support disabled people of our school, entertained people that had oncologic diseases, and conducted some events."
"The first is original black culture which is followed at the home and the other is European culture gifted by the white-skinned Americans which is followed at the school or college or workplace.

"My primary education has always been in French and Arabic, but I was able to catch up to my peers after completing three English language development classes over the course of a year and a half. Although disappointed that I was behind, I am now grateful that my middle school had such courses set aside for newcomers. If I had been placed in a regular English class at that moment, I would not have had any idea what the instructors were teaching. There was not only a language barrier, but also a cultural one that I had to overcome. I was shocked, not only because my peers could not understand my world and teased me about it, but also because I could not understand theirs. Everyone looked, dressed, and behaved differently than at my old school, but I was reassured by how caring, respectful, and understanding my teachers always were. In addition to having the necessary classes at John Muir, I was very fortunate to meet Ms. Kaye, an academic counselor that changed my life and helped me identify UCLA as my dream school."

"However, in the recently years, people pay more attention in the human rights. Some of people start thinking that the death penalty should be abolished.

"Anytime that any of the Tyrones tries to speak up for one of their concerns or about what goes on in the family, they are either silenced, reminded that those are one of the forbidden topics that they shouldn\u2019t speak about, or are told not to listen. \u201d Now, now, lad. You better than pay attention\u201d (O\u2019Neill, 112). It seems that the only way the Tyrone family knows how to deal with problems is by avoidance, and the images of light and dark used throughout the story convey the difference between truth and \u201chiding in the shadows\u201d. A Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night\u201d is a metaphor for how the family\u2019s once great and bright past leads into the misery that is their present. Maybe the family\u2019s despair comes as an effect of their escape from reality by means of morphine, alcohol addiction, and self congratulatory delusion, or maybe because each persons isolation from each other and lack of family bonding experiences (notice that they don\u2019t even eat dinner together). What they haven\u2019t realized is that by totally ignoring their present and trying to hide all their pain they are only blinding themselves to the good in their lives and jeopardizing their future happiness as well."
"The chances of these women having a pregnancy in the tube increases up to 4 times. Premature delivery increases up to 50% and when one realizes that prematurity is the commonest cause for infants being mentally or physically defective, having cerebral palsy or other difficulties, then one realizes that those doctors doing abortions in great numbers south of the border or across the water, even in Canada may not be doing the women and her family a service. They will tell you that abortion has almost no complications. What most of them will not tell you, is that once the abortion is done they may refuse to see the women again and that she must take her post-abortal problems elsewhere. Those seeking repeal of the present abortion law will rapidly point out that nevertheless, it is safer to have a legal abortion than illegal abortions, safer for the women that is. This I don not dispute, but here is the real rub. Liberalized abortion laws do not eliminate illegal, back street abortions and in some cases, the overall number of illegal abortions actually rise, usually stays stagnant, and rarely falls. There are still people who would rather try it themselves or go somewhere they will be completely anonymous. Another factor enters the total number of people seeking abortion, legal or illegal rises. The overall pregnancy rate rockets and people become careless with contraception and a women can have 3 or 4 abortions during the time of one full term pregnancy. Are doctors really being kind to the girl to allow her to choose life or death for her unborn child? In aborting a 16 year old this year with so-called informed consent, we may be preventing her from having even 1 or 2 children 10 years later when happily married. No, repealing the abortion law does not make it possible for every women to safely eliminate, what is for her, an unwanted pregnancy. Would limiting abortions to accredited hospitals make it safer? Yes, safer for the women, not for the fetus and it would jeopardize the continued well being of all of the members of the community with the gross misuse of the medical manpower, hospital facilities and money. With almost 31,739 abortions performed in Ontario in 1989, the cost to OHIP is about 9 million dollars. Yet to do as has been done in the U.S.A and the United Kingdom \u2013 namely to make legal, abortions is to turn so-called \u2018backstreet butchers\u2019 into legal operators. Patients now go into the office through the front door instead of the rear. I have heard it said that is abortions became available on request, many less children would be born and we could use the pleasant delivery suites and postnatal beds for abortions. As I have pointed out, however, before today, liberalization of abortion does not reduce the birth rate. There would be little increase in available facilities or indeed doctor\u2019s time. By the very nature of the operation and because the longer pregnancy lasts, the more difficult it is, patients for abortions are admitted as urgent cases or emergencies so that all other members of the community must wait longer for their hospital bed or the surgery they need. Who will pay for there abortions? With medicare, of course, it is you and I. I know one full tern pregnancy costs most than an abortion, but not much more. And it does not cost more than 3 abortions and that is what happens when the climate or choice for life or death of the unborn child changes. Let us use this money for constructive purposes, not destructive."
"A bit later in the 1930\u2019s, The Dust Ball also occurred in Texas, this was a large amount of dust was lifted off the ground and placed on another part of the land, ruining all soil causing problems once again for people, especially farmers with poor soil, meant no crops. This got so bad that people\u2019s homes were covered in thick layers of soil, dust and sand, farmers were blamed due to poor farming, and bad weather was also to blame. Once again families had to leave, again to California, but California already had enough employees and no space or people to live as people were living in shanties, homes made out of hay and other things."
"On the grounds of religion, each religious belief has its views on the concept of abortion, In Christianity abortion is considered a bad omen, an evil practice and non-acceptable by God, the Roman Catholic Church teaches that abortion is wrong and any member of the church found involved in the practice can be excommunicated from the church."
"If there are necessary sacrifices to be made for human progress, is it not essential to hold to the principle that those to be sacrificed must make the decision themselves? We can all decide to give up some- thing of ours, but do we have the right to throw into the pyre the children of others, or even our own children, for a progress which is not nearly as clear or present as sickness or health, life or death?"
"How did Patricia play her role of being a mother? How did her parenting style shape and aspire Trevor? His mother was an exceptional role model to Trevor and showed him traits of being resistant, strong-willed and also receptive to incidents that are not easily accepted by others. like treating women with respect and equal rights which was not taught in their culture before these traits later result shape Trevor into a fine, successful man with great manners and shows astonishing quality."
"Canada was the very first country in the world to introduce a multicultural policy (Satzewich, 1992). In 1969, the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism heard many ethnic spokespersons argue that Canada should adopt the idea of a \u201ccultural mosaic\u201d, where different cultures would each contribute to Canada, making the country unified through each culture\u2019s uniqueness."
"Social hierarchy, in other words, was losing some of its ideological viability. In one cultural arena, the concept of \u201csensibility\u201d blossomed into a new ideological centerpiece, a new way of justifying hierarchy and inequality, wherein elites earn their role not by birch but by showing a sublime sensibility surpassing that of this under-lings. As the concept of \u201csensibility\u201d grew into a form that could offer ideological support to a hierarchy that was otherwise losing its ideolog-ical viability, so the concept of \u201crace\u201d came to give \u201cslavery\u201d a new kind of ideological support Neither \u201crace\u201d nor \u201csensibility\u201d was invented in the eighteenth century, but each of these concepts was remapped into the cultural gestalt with a new significance that ended up outlasting the immediate political needs it served."
"This shows that Edward has had a proper upbringing and has learnt to share but Mickey is more independent and shows he has to stick up for himself. This is shown when Mickey explains to Edward that he has to do something like lick his eldest brother\u2019s shoes just to get one sweet let alone the whole bag. The pair of them try to impress each other when sitting down. First Mickey pulls his jumper over his knees and then so does Edward. This is showing that they are starting to form a friendship by mirroring each other\u2019s actions. This also reinforces the ages of the boys as they have grown up."
"Another possible underlying ground in finding friendship and love can be characters complementarities. If one person is introvert, his soul mate is likely to be extrovert. In this way, the former one will encourage his friend to open up emotionally to each other while the latter will give motivating spur to be more communicative and sociable. The identical rule can be applied to the way how women or men choose their Mr or Ms Right."
"In the 1930\u2019s it was especially hard for black men to find work but as Crooks was disabled and black, it would have been very hard for Crooks to be accepted. Steinbeck wanted the readers to see how Crooks had to put up With the abuse to secure his place on the ranch as he really had no choice. The only choices he had were: deal with the abuse and have a place to stay, eat and earn a little knowing that if he left, a crippled man like him will not be accepted anywhere else."
"Culturally responsive teaching is guidance that recognizes and benefits from social decent variety, It endeavors to do this in different ways. Tolerating and esteeming social contrasts, pleasing distinctive examples of social connection, and expanding on understudies\u2019 social foundations. There was an instructor I had from my elementary school that was a culturally responsive educator. She constantly ensured each culture felt \u2018safe\u2019. A couple of things I could remember her doing was she made her classroom a nonjudgment zone, becoming greatly acquainted with her student, dependably assessing her conduct, adjusting her instruction (to ensure all students comprehended the material), and incorporating all cultures into her educating. Conveying that we perceive and esteem"
"a. don\u2019t feel that crime punishment should be imposed based on age if it is a crime that resulted out of deliberation. b.If an eleven year old was malicious enough to plot murders of his parents or peers that same eleven year old should be punished as if he were 35. c.Perhaps is youths were exposed to the physical consequences of their actions the desire or idea to commit such crimes would lessen."
"America was a far more racist community than it was now. I know this from the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) this was (and still is) a white supremacist organisation, which has an aim of striking fear and intimidation into black people. The KKK believed that blacks were like animals and had little rights due to the fact that they are black-terrible, but true- black people were routinely dragged out of their homes and beaten, raped, castrated (cutting off penis and testicles) or possibly murdered. Slavery was abolished in America; it was very strong in the southern states. This is why Crooks says that he isn\u2019t a southern Negro \u201cI ain\u2019t a southern negro\u201d this shows that Crooks was born a free black. Crooks (as far as we know) hasn\u2019t suffered from the KKK but it could still effect him because he know in theory what will happen to him."
"In William Shakespeare\u2019s plays, the moms of a portion of the real characters are missing; they are only here and there referenced and here and there isn\u2019t even any passing reference to them. Shakespeare has forgotten the maternal figure in a considerable lot of his plays including King Learand Taming of the Shrew."
"At the Cabot home, Jean tells Rick she wants the locked changed in the morning, because she believes Daniel is going to give the keys to all his \u201cgangbanger\u201d friends. Meanwhile, Farhad hires Daniel to fix the lock to his store, and Daniel informs him that his entire door is broken. Farhad\u2019s limited English and mistrust of others leads him to believe that Daniel is trying to \u201ccheat\u201d him. Later, Farhad\u2019s shop is broken into and ravaged. Since Daniel had warned Farhad about the broken door, the insurance company denies payment, claiming negligence. He blames Daniel, and seeking revenge, he waits for Daniel at his house, and shoots him just as his daughter runs out of the house."
"Amir thinks of Hassan as less worthy human being even though he is jealous of him, this mix of jealousy and resentment leads to a guilt that Amir handles unethically. Amir treats Hassan much like a dog. He believes that he can treat him as roughly as possible, but the animal will be forever loyal. Amir does not believe that he needs to defend Hassan, since Hassan is ultimately there to sacrifice himself for Amir. Amir is jealous of Hassan because of Hassan\u2019s approval earned by Baba, and this causes Amir to search for other ways to expand his ego."
"The new laws gave juries guidance for making this decision. (1,2,3,4) Following the case of Furman v. Georgia in 1972, the Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty systems were unconstitutional violations of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prevention on \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishments. After this case many states changed their death penalty laws. Four years later in Gregg v. Georgia (1976), the Court reaffirmed the death penalty as constitutional. Troy Gregg had been found guilty of murder and armed robbery and sentenced to death. He asked the Court to go further than it had in the Furman case, and rule the death penalty itself unconstitutional. The Court refused to do so. The Court found that Georgia\u2019s system for applying the death penalty was \u201cjudicious\u201d and \u201ccareful.\u201d Gregg had gone through two trials \u2013 one to determine guilt and one for sentencing."
"Congress was limiting more Southern Europeans than Northern because they were poorer and could not bring any benefits to the country. \u201cWe need three generation to educate, to crossbreed with Western strains and to assimilate a large number of those that we have here now\u201d (Document F). This suggests that inferiority is would not last forever but the bulk of the argument indicates clearly that the effort to \u201cAmericanize\u201d the new, particularly the \u201cnew immigrants\u201d will exhaust America\u2019s resources had ultimately prove impossible."
"This sense of characterisation which occurred as result of her emotional ties to her place shows how the bird\u2019s environment has shaped her identity. On the contrary, The Death of the Bird shows that identity cannot fully form when it is unable to identify with significant others as she is \u2018Alone in the bright host of her companions\u2019. This oxymoronic line highlights the bird\u2019s incapability to connect with others beyond a physical realm."
"\u201cIn 1991, 8.3% of children in two-parent families were likely to live in poverty; 19.6% of children living with father in single parent family; and 47.1% in single parent family headed by mother\u201d (\u201cPoverty in the United States,\u201d 2012). That means that an average of 33.35% of children coming from a single parent family are likely to live in poverty compared to a mere 8.3% of children living in the traditional, two-parent, family. Another great factor leading to poverty is the level of education of the head of household. \u201cStudies have shown that people who invest in their education or skills can expect higher incomes\u201d (Iceland, 2006, p. 70-71). Obviously, income has"
"Denham blushes, showing that Braithwaite changed his rebellious attitude. Braithwaite\u2019s thought: \u201cSomeday Denham may be a dependable and hard-working man, working in H.M overseas\u201d shows the high expectations he has for Denham, as Braithwaite believes he changed, and he has some inner vivacious qualities, embedded in him. In Weston\u2019s case, the offering of a cigarette shows that they were ready to make amends and to put all the bad events, which took place in the last term, aside and commence a new, fresh beginning."
"The Mexican migrant, also known as a \u201cWetback,\u201d who only violates the immigration law does not consider himself a criminal or lawbreaker. He is playing a game, trying to outwit the authorities, in hopes of bettering himself. To be sure the stakes are high (his survival), but there are few sanctions. If he stays clear of the drug traffic, stealing, drunkenness, fighting, etc., that is if he does not violate local, state, or other federal laws, the worst that can happen to him when apprehended is a trip to the closest detention center. He is held there for a short period of time and then he is taken back to Mexico. This procedure seems a rather inconvenience because, more than likely, the immigrant heads for the United States once again, in hopes of returning to his job. Knowing the life in the U.S. as compared to the one in Mexico will keep him going back, regardless of the inconvenience. Becoming a wetback has been more the role of the male, since it entails long journeys, working with groups of men, hard labor, and a dangerous undertaking. A small percentage of the aliens who are apprehended are women and children. Unskilled women can work in a variety of jobs in agriculture, as dishwashers in restaurants, as hotel maids, as housemaids, or in custodial jobs. Nevertheless; they are most likely treated like the slaves of our history."
"to understand what happened to societies in the past and help know what will affect today\u2019s day.. When studying history, you do not only study an event, you also study everything that had to do leading up to the event, as well as the society\u2019s culture, religion, politics, and economics. In this essay, I will be analyzing the history of the death penalty."
"All of us have experienced moving to another place and adjusting to new surroundings. It is always an experience that fills everyone with insecurities and sometimes dread. We ask ourselves whether we would fit in, or if we could ever regain the friends that we\u2019ve lost when we were plucked from our former places. Although I still have a homeland to always refer to, I too sometimes ask myself questions that make me question who I really am. Questions that make me question my roots and reminisce about the experiences of my family."
"The author recommend that apprehension for the occupation of therapy which encourages making sensible choices is defined in terms of avoidance, development, and health (Myers & & Sweeney, p 483, 2008). According to Lawson (2007) \u201cThe health of a counselor has a direct effect on the quality of services that the customers get\u201d. The health of the counselor thinks about the therapist\u2019s psychological, physical, social, psychological, and spiritual health."
"Personally, I really enjoyed this book, but that\u2019s because I\u2019m not easily affected when it comes to talk of drugs and alcohol. A lot of people I know am and they wouldn\u2019t want to read this book if they knew how much drug and alcohol talk there is. This story does mention drugs and alcohol in the beginning of the book, but that\u2019s in the prologue and nobody that I know takes the time to read that. They go straight to the story part. If I were someone who is easily affected by drug and alcohol talk, especially if I was under 14, I would definitely want to know that there is that type of talk in the story before I read it."
"This quote in particular shows Devi\u2019s lack of determination and commitment in achieving her goals to complete tasks and achieve what they want. In the first sentence, Malladi describes Devi\u2019s failure being quite continuous when she states \u201cyet again\u201d. When she states that \u201cshe was not going to be able to change her life\u201d (Malladi, 1) this displays Devi\u2019s lack of commitment and\u00a0determination in accomplishing her goals because once she fails, she no longer has hope and decides that her fate will never change thus cancelling out any possibilities for improvement. The idea of not improving and changing what she thinks could be her fate leads Devi to think that the only choice she has is to end her life, which shows her lack of enthusiasm and determination to fulfill her ambitions and desires."
"Her opinion is that apartheid benefits no one. On the other hand, Julio Polanco writes about a social issue. In his poem he says, \u201cI\u2019d rather be a tall ugly weed\u201d (Polanco). This is an extended metaphor used to show how the narrator prefers being strong and free while suffering hardship as opposed to being under the rule of another. Julio Polanco shows that he believes in the right of freedom. By the same token, Evanescence\u2019s style in their lyrics voices their opinion on hypocrites. They think these kinds of people go from fooling everyone to becoming \u201ceveryone\u2019s fool\u201d (Lee). In conclusion, these artists use the theme to express themselves."
"Therefore Steinbeck portrays Curley\u2019s wife as a woman who is dangerous and disliked by linking her with words that supports the point. John Steinbeck points out many flaws in Curley\u2019s wife. For example, he does this when he writes, \u201cshe leaned against the door frame so that her body was thrown forward\u201d (Page 51). In this statement, Steinbeck is pointing out that Curley\u2019s wife always tries to instigate something. He also describes her body image and how provocative she is, always looking for attention. Steinbeck says many more things to condemn Curley\u2019s wife, but that is not all that he says about her."
"Last but not least, Othello\u2019s marginalization by the whole society makes him reflect about his own social status and understanding of himself. The process of being marginalized brings about Othello\u2019s insecurity and destroys his inner defense, which eventually leads to his downfall. Firstly, Othello\u2019s marginalization comes from him having a different social status. Othello\u2019s position as a general should have given him a high social status but because of his Moor background, Othello is made to be an outsider. Iago states that:"
"In order to test whether infants do indeed understand anaphoric reference, the Intermodal Preferential Looking Paradigm was used to test 24 infants who were selected to participate. They were given a video clip to watch with the screen divided into two, as well as an accompanying audio. The test was divided into two phases \u2013 the Familiarisation Phase, and the Test Phase. During Familiarisation, the children were shown a yellow bottle in alternating sections with an accompanying audio that named the object \u2013 \u201cLook! A yellow bottle.\u201d This was repeated thrice."
"My mother has many jobs through the years. Having me, she had to start work at sixteent She never made good money, and her life was not very good for some years She finally found a job in banking that she likes, Since getting this job, she has transferred out of one company and moved to another, which she has been working at for seven years. She went from a normal worker at minimum wage to a supervisor at her work. She is a very important person at her work and her work wouldn\u2018t be able to function if it weren\u2019t for her, so for this I truly admire her. I love my mother to death with all my heart, and always will Even if she wasn\u2018t my mother and I did not know her, I would still admire her for all she has been through and where she has worked herself up to today, She is a great caring loving person and is definitely someone I can look up to."
"The story is constructed to tell a tale that allows the reader to relate and empathize with characters as well as watch them from a distance. Gift of the Magi is written in third person omniscient format. Although the narrator does not take place in the story but rather has the ability to read and relate the emotions and drives of the characters. The setting in this story is transcendent. This version of the story takes place in a small apartment; however, and it is easy to imagine that this particular story be told from any setting."
"Jin Wang\u2019s negative experience story is also another way Yang used to connect his audience to the book. Jin constantly struggles with his Chinese background and the American Culture. He desperately wants to fit in with the American students in the school, but he is constantly reminded about the Chinese stereotypes that are keeping him form fitting-in. \u201cMy momma says Chinese people eat dogs. \u201cNow be nice, Timmy! \u201d -I\u2019m sure Jin doesn\u2019t do that! In fact, Jin\u2019s family probably stopped that sort of thing as soon as they came to the United States! (Yang 30-31) Jin tries his best to fit-in with the other students, but everything he tries backfires because he is constantly criticized. He changes his hairstyle, dates an American girl, and tries to act \u201cAmerican. \u201d"
"Even though I didnt understand why I received the punishments I got when I was growrng up, now | see that it was all for the good. I commend her on her hard work for 17 years raising me alone. She put my needs before hers and one I day would like to repay her. Because she was raismg me by herself, my mother was not able to get a college degree in business, which she always wanted. I would like to ultimately thank her by givmg her my college degree. Since she didnt have the chance to earn one I would like to, when the time comes, accept my degree in her name."
"Professors and administrators should not be allowed to carry a gun on campuses because they are not trained for how to respond to active shooting situations. \u201cA concealed carry class is a permitting class, not a training class.

"Consequentially, this generation speculates that some of us in social media aren\u2019t \u201creal\u201d, that we all have this made up character, but this is really because we are afraid to show the world if we are good enough for the viewers eyes. This means, that we are constantly re-creating ourselves, changing, because at a point we just care about what the audience think of us. Thirdly, social media has a big impact on self-esteem, it often shows these models with those great bodies and that has a great effect on people\u2019s self-esteem leading to depression and anxiety. For that reason, viewing other people\u2019s selfies lowers self-esteem, because users compare themselves to photos of people looking their happiest."
"Curley\u2019s wife is introduced by Candy as a \u201ctart\u2019 who \u201cgot the eye\u201d (page 31). Lennie and George have a childhood friend who is in prison \u201con account of a tart\u201d (page 63). Also their own troubles result from a tempting attitude of two women: the woman in Weed and Curley\u2019s wife. Being called \u201ctart\u201d, \u201ctramp\u201d and \u201cjail bait\u201d from the first time when they are seen or mentioned in the story, it is a sign of prejudice. Men judge them from the first sight without knowing them well. Men assume that Curley\u2019s wife is a \u201ctramp\u201d. \u201cJesus, what a tramp\u201d (page 35) says George when he sees her in the bunk house."
"When people from different walks of life with varying opinions come together to work on a project, there is always going to be a butting of heads. During that initial shock period, the members of the group adjust to the influx of different thoughts and ideas before eventually settling into the situation. Although it takes time, diversity is beneficial in strengthening the societal bonds and mindsets of those involved. During the period following the diversification of the organization, the clashing of ideas can make things frustrating; with diversity comes the challenge of old ideas that worked in the past when there was no diversity. News ideas that present solutions to the problem differently and more efficiently will receive push-back. Accepting them will take some time, but this rough adjustment period is worth it. Without the introduction of these new ideas, \u201cwe will never understand the other perspectives\u2026 And therefore lock ourselves into a\u2026 The closed-minded ideology that has only led to hate, prejudice, and tragedy throughout history\u201d2."
"Recent scandals have brought into focus the need for business ethics. The US firm, Enron, filed bankruptcy due to business ethics being ignored and Deadwood had the same fate for South Korea. Corporations have adopted codes of ethics to repair their image to the world. \u201cAmong four people-centered core values, human-centered management/human resource development and knowledge sharing were the values preferred by the managerial group. Managers placed more importance on accountability values, among which obedience to the law was significantly emphasized by the managers. With respect to the social responsibility values, the managerial group scored higher for the value of disclosure with no significant difference."
"\u2018Unfortunately, the murderer has deprived his family and friends of a loved one. Their grief begins with the murder. It may not end with the murderer\u2019s execution, but the execution does engender a feeling of relief at no longer having to think about the ordeal\u2014a feeling which often fails to arise while the murderer still lives on.\u2019(Manzano, 2017). It is show that the death penalty can make a positive to the family members of victims. \u2018Many victims desire and demand revenge, vengeance, and retribution.\u2019 (Lifton & Mitchell, 2002). If the law can\u2019t give criminals the punishment they deserve, the family members may take some measures to punish the criminals in their own way. Although the death penalty is not enacted to revenge, but can make the family members of victims feel more comfort. In Japan, an 18 years old boy raped and killed a woman and killed her son who was only 11 months old. The criminal except said sorry one time, he had no confession to the victim. When he was sentenced to life imprisonment (because he was young, he is protected by law, he may just stand in prison only seven or eight years), the husband felt painful. The husband of the victim continuously appealed, and the end of the events, the boy was sentenced to the death penalty. The death penalty is not only to remove a frenzied person from society, but also to reassure family members and let the dead get the respect they deserve."
"While white people are given opportunities and benefits, dark colored skin people may be at a disadvantage to these opportunities and benefits. \u201cMany analysis of white privilege interpret whiteness as an intangible economic good\u201d ( Black Reconstruction in America: W. E. B. Du Bois. ). White privilege is the original form of racism that has existed throughout much of American history. Race has been used to define cultural categories of \u2018white\u2019 and \u2018non-white\u2019 human beings. Whites were defined as being the superior species and blacks were considered inferior and incapable of advancing themselves."
"Through this essay I have demonstrated my understanding of equality and diversity and how it affects the policy and practice in my setting. I have made reference to current legislation to support my discussion. Legislation I have referred to includes Equality act (2010), Human rights act, Employment equality act, SEN and disability act, Race relations act, Sex discrimination act and the Warnock report. I have discussed areas of discrimination in the early years practice like language and terminology, stereotyping and anti discriminatory practice and the diversity in early years settings."
"They will cry to communicate their needs with their parents starting to understand the different types of cry indicating the different needs. A baby will starting to recognize the parents or careers voices and may calm when they hear this and will be noticeably trying to focus on the face of the person who is holding them and are able to focus at a range of 20 \u2013 CACM. As a baby progresses to about 3 months old the child would have grown in both height and weight. Babies may have learnt the difference between night and day and may be able to sleep through the night."
"The results you gain from expanding knowledge into the world of nursing is extremely significant as it allows individuals like me to gain an insight to how and why the healthcare system is organised and run in a specific manner. Commencing from when I was younger, I aspired to become a nurse as I enjoyed the thought of helping people, regardless of background and/or culture. The art of Nursing is beautiful in terms of the kindness, understanding and generosity expressed through the healthcare of each and every individual."
"Scholars contend that during this age important industries were metalworking, pottery making, glassmaking, and tie-and-die weaving. About the turn of the Millennium A.D., some families from surrounding island kingdoms set sail in boat and establish their communities along riverbanks or on deltas. Which is the period of trading relations with neighboring island, mostly by asian traders. These early wooden watercrafts iin the country were called balangay. The balangay was basically a plank boat. It was driven either by a sail or by paddling. Malay was the principal language of Southeast Asian commerce during those times. It is not surprising that a number of Malay loan words to Philippine language pertain to commerce. At the height of the Sri Vijaya power around 1000 A.D., the Sri Vijayan merchants conducted extensive trade with China and India. In the 12th century the Sumatra based kingdom of Sri Vijaya had also expanded as influence In the Philippine archipelago. According to Sulu tradition between 900 and 1200 A.D., immigrants from Champa, an indianized kingdom in Indochina, established a trading colony with the Buranuns of Sulu. The men of Champa were called Orang dapuans who were then vassals of the Sri Vijaya Empire. The Orang Dampuans settled in Taguima. They became the ancestors of the Yakans."

According to Critser, this saying that the American family is a problem to childhood obesity but later says parents aren\u2019t to blame. Critser uses a strawman tactic saying pressure causes tension by Diamonds. This is true in a sense, but the way Critser uses this saying is that he leaves it at that. He says no more. He doesn\u2019t mention anything else about pressure causing tension. He just quotes Diamonds and what they have to say."
"Ideally, I would like to work in either Illinois or New York Certain areas in Illinois and New York have a good need for forensic scientists, normally located close to a large city. Illinois has an employment of 450 and a location quotient of .69. New York has an employment of 840 and a location quotient of .81. These numbers are higher than the average for the United States."
"The success of these companies is attributed to all the successful mergers and acquisitions that have taken place throughout J&J history. Many of these companies were opened due to successful mergers that allowed J&J to develop new products and offer them in different markets throughout the world. The successful organization of the products J&J offers allows J&J to successfully merge with other companies to gain additional control over the industry."
"In closing the other hand, the government will constantly be in the business of marriage and families for several reasons having private relationships open doors for polygamy, incest, there may be an increase of child exploitation, the courts would overwork with divorces, custody battles and other family issues. Many taxpayers will be putting out more funds due to state and federal government is involved with family issues of crime, drugs, teen pregnancy, school issues, and mental health. So, no matter how we look at it the political perspective of the government will always be involved in family matters. The political perspective includes passing laws, mandate specific rules and regulations that will interfere in one\u2019s life so no one will ever live an absolute private life in America."

"Several economic or political emigrants shift collectively with their own families towards the new countries or regions where they are likely to can find employment opportunities or peace that may not be in their available country of origin. Right through history a bug number of the emigrants go back to their countries of origin, mostly after earning and saving satisfactory money from the other country."
"Younger children are the most affected by the TV violence because they spend most of their time watching. Children between the age of 2 and 5 spend about 28 hours every week watching TVs. The number of hours reduces as the age goes up. At a normal life span, a man would have watched for 10 uninterrupted years, day and night without a break viewing thing and programs that he has no control of and are not of his choice. According to the research that was done US news, 91% of the people interviewed revealed that TV violent programs contributes to real life violence."
"The death penalty is the easy way out for criminals. They won\u2019t be able to feel the guilt for the person they killed. A person should be able to carry all the pain and guilt they have suffered to the other person\u2019s loved ones. Not only does the law kill people who may be innocent but also people of color. Why have a law that kills a big amount of innocent people or that discriminates against people?"
"There are many factors that victims consider in their decision not to report it to the police, but the greatest reason is the fear that threats to kill you or your family will become reality. Other reasons include embarrassment, shame and hopes that his promises to change will come true this time. There is an assumption in our society that there is a clear relationship between anger and physical violent behavior. However, anger is a human emotion and studies have shown that physical violence or abuse is a learnt behavior and the perpetrator is more often than not, going to repeat this behavior."
"According to Elizabeth T. Gershoff (2013) \u201cspanking consistently predicted increases in the child\u2019s aggression over time, regardless of how aggressive children were when the spanking occurred\u201d (p.134). According to Gershoff, the researches show that \u201cspanking is linked with the same negative child outcome as abuse, just to a slightly lesser degree\u201d (as cited in Suneson , 2016, para. 6). The New findings in psychological science, shows that \u201cthe children who have been spanked by their parents by age 5 show an increase in behavioral problems at age 6 and at age 8 as compare to other children who have never been spanked\u201d(Elizabeth, 2017, para."
"This directly shows her status in society, and how her authority is affected by her husband. She is not given her own name in the novel, instead taking Curley\u2019s name \u2013 becoming a sort of extension of Curley. She is not independent, as she does not have her own separate name, and shows that her position of authority is lower than Curley\u2019s \u2013 he is the dominant one."
"Another aspect of criminal law that I found interesting is the exclusionary rule. This rule that is embedded within the fourth amendment was established to prevent evidence that had been obtained through illegal search and seizure by law enforcement or any government entity from being admissible in court. It mainly serves a deterrence to stop law enforcement from participating in illegally obtaining evidence. Another interesting fact is that if any evidence that lies within the guidelines of the exclusionary rule contributed to the discovery of other evidence, which would have otherwise not been located, then the newly discovered evidence is protected under the exclusionary rule. This is what\u2019s known as the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine. Although these practices are a sure fire way to get incriminating evidence excluded from the trial; the courts have established many ways to obtain exceptions. The first one is the good faith exception. According to the good faith exception, evidence does not have to be excluded if the officers relied on a search one that turned out to be invalid by chance. This exception was created in 1981 through the ruling of Herring vs the United States. The Supreme Court ruled that it is constitutional for the police to arrest on the grounds of another warrant in anther jurisdiction that may or may not be valid. Another exception to the exclusionary rule is the independent source doctrine. According to this exception, any evidence that was firstly gathered during an unreasonable search, may be used in court if it is later obtained through a legal search and seizure. This particular exception was created as a result of the ruling of Murray Vs the United States. Another exception to the exclusionary rule is that of inevitable discovery. According to this exception states that any evidence that was found using illegal search and seizure methods may be used in court if eventually the evidence would have been found anyway. This doctrine of the exclusionary rule was created in response to the Supreme Court ruling of Nix Vs Williams. For example, The last exception to the exclusionary rule that I will discuss is this attenuation doctrine is exception calls for despite obtaining evidence illegally the evidence may be utilized in court if the connection between the illegal act and the evidence provides that despite the illegality in obtaining evidence, such evidence may be admissible if there is no viable connection between the illegal search and the evidence that was obtained."
"Nurturant Parenting Approach: It is also known as slow parenting. It does not mean that parents are very slow in doing things for their children. But on the other sense doing qualitative rather than quantitative things. Create meaningful connections with your kids and being present for them in every situation. Nurturing good habits in them and do not focus on results and competition but focus on their life as a process or journey. Allow your child to take risks to know themselves their strengths and weaknesses. Let them be creative and use their mind to grow them better and make their own decisions."
"Every generation faces new challenges and new problems. What do you think is the b suggest difference between your generation and older generations? How do you think these differences will affect the future of our country and/or your career choice? Every generation is different in so many ways, but at the same time, we\u2019re exactly alike e. We, as teenagers, are unsure, insecure, and confused about who we are and what we want t o do with our lives."
"This act of the UK parliament defines the ways in which members of the public may gain access to government held information. The act creates a right of access when requested by an individual to information held by public authorities, promoting openness and transparency whilst minimising the risk of harm to any individual entity."
"Lives are lead with anxiety over certain issues and with apprehension towards certain events. This play, Fences written by the playwright August Wilson deals with the progression of a family through the struggles of oppression and the inability to obtain the American Dream. The characters in the play develop throughout the story and can be viewed or interpreted in many different ways, but one man remains constant during the play and that is Troy. Due to certain events that transpired as he was growing up, Troy is shaped into a very stubborn yet proud man."
"Sarfraz Najeib.Najeib along with his brother Shahzad and three friends, then students at Leeds Metropolitan University had been attending the the Majestyk night-club club when on leaving the club an argument took place with the then Leeds United player Jonathan Woodgate and Lee Bowyer.Bowyer was cleared of attacking student while Woodgate received 100 hours\u2019 community service for affray."
"In Ecuador gender roles are so delineated. Men are expected to work and women are expected to stay at home raising the children. It is not common for females to work outside the home. Most females graduate from high school and after high school they start raising families. My cousin knows both cultures but since she was born and raised in the United States she identifies more with the American culture. When her baby gets older she expects to go back to work and even go back to school so that she can be able to provide a better living for both."
"The insurance principle refers to the guarantee secured by the State that any loss incurred by a registered land resulting from reliance on the conclusiveness of the land Registry by a land purchaser will be compensated through a statutory indemnity system. The curtain principle, on the other hand, is the concept that land registration may allow certain equitable interests attached to the land hidden from a purchaser\u2019s view. This \u2018curtain,\u2019 however, does not affect the validity of any transaction on the registered land so long as the details of the registration reflects the validity of the title."
"The city of Greater Dandenong is one of the most diverse communities in Victoria. The city has a long history of welcoming new and emerging communities, including migrants arriving through humanitarian programs. More than half of these residents were born overseas with 55% from non-English speaking countries. Many of those who have migrated to the area have origins in parts of the world with recent histories of conflict, violence and displacement (City of Greater Dandenong 2014b)."
"Computer Security risk can be classified into two main categories which are computer crimes and cybercrimes. Computer crime involves knowingly interfering with computer security which involves a deliberate act against the law and cyber crime is defined as \u201cTraditionally, crime has been defined as an intentional violation of the legal code that is punishable by the state\u201d. (Vermaat, 2010) Cybercrime has become a serious crime and the FBI as include this into their top three priorities. The perpetrator of cybercrime and computer crimes has fall into seven basic categories which are hacker, cracker, Script Kiddie, corporate spy, unethical employee, cyber extortionist, and cyber terrorist."
"The table of contents in a grant proposal is a structured layout for the reader to be able to find the information they are looking for. It should be clear, concise, and provided enough details to refer to the proper section in the proposal. For PEACE Domestic Violence Agency, the table of contents will also serve as a checklist when writing the grant proposal. It should not be more than two pages. It is one of the first sections to develop during the grant proposal process and the last step to complete. SPECIFIC AIMS/BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE/NEEDS AND PROBLEM STATEMENT In this section, a brief overview of PEACE Domestic Violence Agency is written. It will include the overall rationale and basis for the development of this program."
"This is seen to be relating within both of the texts but mainly within \u2018Snow Falling on Cedars\u2019 in that there is a clear distinction between the races: there is the Japanese and the Whites. In \u2018The Sea and Poison\u2019 however there are many different races such as the Chinese, the American, the Germans and the Japanese. Within Endo\u2019s novel the reader can find representations of racism in ways that are not really expected. There is the major theme of racism towards the US, but what is even more obvious are the racist ideas and actions that the Japanese have towards their Asian cousins."
"Radical Feminists consider that because society is so malestream that it results in the oppression of women in society, and they call this Patriarchy (Bilton et al, 1996). At the other end of the scale, post feminists believe that women are now freer than ever in society, and that feminism is no longer necessary, they believe that patriarchy has been reduced on such a large scale (Kidd et al, 2003). This has had an enormous effect on the family and is another one of the reasons why Murdock\u2019s ideal is becoming so much harder to achieve."
"The closure of Planned Parenthood will have many women take on an abortion of their own. According to Stephens (2016) \u201cThere was an estimated of 119,000 searches of the exact phrase \u201cHow to have a miscarriage or self abort, how to get methods of performing an abortion, such as with the coat hanger methods, how to retrieve contraceptives online of aborting oneself\u201d."
"Most of the information provided by the mass media especially the radio, television and internet is unsuitable to children. It may contain violence, obscenity or strong language. Since these are harmful to the children they don\u2019t have a right over them and so their parents or guardians have to protect the children from such by deciding on what is good or bad for them. The parents also have to protect on what their children browse on the internet since they can access pornography or sites with violence which are harmful to the child (CRC)."
"On the opposite hand, the problems may be associated with long operating hours of workers which might have Associate in Nursing adverse impact on their performance. This additionally has been noticed within the case analysis within which in line with Nick Greenhalgh, an excessive amount of operating hours might lead to unhealthy, unproductive, and rancorous workers which will once more become a key issue. Excessive hours of operating might have negative consequences on employee\u2019s health. It will cause the fatigue, depression and anger within the workers. Moreover, the longer operating hours escort them to low morale, state of discontentment and discomfort with their jobs. Moreover, some corporations might face difficulties in implementing the changes created with relevance geographical point diversity (Patrick & Kumar, 2012)."
"The purpose of a toy is not only for the user to get enjoyment out of it, although this is the main aim. Toys are also important for preschool and during school education. Playing is the most effective way of getting a child to learn. Small children learn by doing, seeing, hearing and talking ive found that out by a book for Childs needs. One of the things a child does whilst playing is testing their ideas about the world. Because there is so much to learn in such a short space of time the learning has to be fun, as long as the child is having fun he or she will go on learning and finding pleasure in his or her knowledge."
"Luckily he has his family and friend who come and see him to keep him company, and he is very grateful for them. He tells the reader to not worry about him and tells them to \u201cbelieve things are good with [him], and even when they\u2019re not, they will be soon enough\u201d. This shows that he\u2019s got hope for the future and that he is trying to be positive, even in a tough situation"
"Chinese mothers if you ask gatekeepers wherever all through the world, what they wish for their children, most by far of them would answer that their children should have a happy life. Does it suggest that gatekeepers direct every single movement for their youngsters to take. At the point when an adolescent become acclimated with follow orders from his/her people continually and doesn\u2019t have any kind of chance in his/her additional time, wouldn\u2019t this overbearing adolescence and zero opposition toward the child lead to frail concentrations and slip-ups all through child\u2019s life."
"Although going through that experience with my best friend was one of the hardest things in my life, knowing that there were numerous attempts to seek help from law enforcement to only be ignored angered me more. As I discussed before, police officers are not concerned with victims of domestic violence. At least that\u2019s what many victims say including my best friend. Victims are not taken seriously because the misdemeanor crime is not taken seriously. Regardless of your race, being a victim of an intimate partner relationship continues to get the back seat. Studies have shown that certain characteristics do play a significant part of how a police officer will act to an individual call for service. In cases of domestic violence police attitudes towards women, different races, and even sexual preference has played a detailed part between making arrests and telling an abuser to just take a walk and cool off."
"There were many more reasons why reconstruction was a failure but these were the most impactful. Like all things in life, reconstruction had to come to an end, the resulting outcome was both a success and a failure. The Ku Klux Klan was a group of white males that would rally their views and opinions about African Americans. They were completely against the idea of them being freedmen. Congress\u2019 reconstruction efforts to have equal rights for freedom failed because the KKK would intervene in the wrong ways."
"After that Algernon thinks that married life is an unpleasant experience as he has to spend more money, and the champagne isn\u2019t as high quality. Later on in the play, towards the end Algernon stands up to his Aunt Augusta (Lady Bracknell) by saying that he doesn\u2019t \u201ccare a twopence about social possibilities\u201d, so Algernon is saying that he doesn\u2019t mind if he looses respect by marrying Cecily because he loves her. He has also killed off Bunbury by this point, I think maybe because he has never been in love properly before, and he always thought that marriage was a bad thing, but his family would expect him to get married, therefore he created Bunbury so he could still leave a bachelor style life on the side."
"The Immigrants were constantly treated immorally and blamed for the disorders in the country. They were first accused of poverty. Indeed to citizens, the ghettos were altogether alien territory associated with filth and crime. American social scientists approached their subject through the analysis of specific disorders such as criminality, intemperance, poverty, and disease. Everywhere they looked, they found immigrants somehow involved in these problems. They concluded that immigrants were responsible for every evil that falls upon the country: pauperism, economic depressions, and the low birth rate of natives, class divisions, prostitution and homosexuality, and the appearance of city slums. A violent anti-Chinese movement had developed in California in 1873 and categorized Chinese with Blacks and Indians, which led to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882."
"It is apparent, just with the studies mentioned earlier, that a person\u2019s environment affected a person\u2019s intelligence and performance in life. While my interview with Lauren also showed that a person\u2019s upbringing and culture contributes to a person\u2019s personality and attitude. Lauren\u2019s traits-such as her kind, helpful, forgiving and considerate nature- and behavior toward others are formed and developed by her parents. While her culture played a part in her attitude and relations toward older people. However, her motivation for doing any task comes from within and her interactions with people are based on how she feels toward them."
"The Face Negotiation Theory is established by Stella Ting-Toomey, which discusses the way by which people with different cultures communicate and manage conflict. In 1985, Stella Ting Toomey explains in her theory that disagreements and conflicts are usually brought about by identity management on the individualistic and collectivistic levels. The different facets that characterizes the identity of an individual or group is referred to as \u201cfaces\u201d."
"It is difficult to make a decision to whether to let a person live or die. It is difficult from a moral point of view and ethical too. Perhaps that is why in most countries the death penalty is abolished and does not apply. Maybe because it\u2019s easier. Maybe because it\u2019s running away from responsibility. Maybe because it should. Maybe if the command of Christ \u2018Love Your Neighbor\u2019 is at the head of everyone at any time then there will be no need for these decisions. Perhaps then there will be no crimes."
"In examples female genital mutilation which is common in Nigeria, Togo, Egypt and Somalia is existed which is the female will undergo a surgical remove of clitoris (Boyle, 2002). It is the means of social control that shows the selfishness of men. The reason some of the female perform this kind of surgical is husband hope their wives be virgins before marriage and remain sexually faithful after marriage. In my opinion, the virginity of a female should not control by using surgical method that had restricted women\u2019s rights."
"The really first method of subjugation against the Aboriginals was the remotion of their ownership of land and belongingss. when the white colony foremost began. This lead up to the maltreatment of Aboriginal labor and hapless on the job conditions. The attempt to \u2018protect\u2019 and \u2018integrate\u2019 indigens into white society with the Assimilation Policy during the mid 1800\u2019s is perchance one of the most terrible methods of subjugation used in this issue. Even throughout the First World War. Aborigines were banned from fall ining the ground forces to contend for their rightful fatherland."
"The 2nd component of RBAC theoretical account is hierarchal RBAC. In any organisation ( In this instance MPS ) staffs often has multiple occupation duties and privileges and nonspecific operations exist that all staffs should be able to execute. This sort of function distribution is highly hard and administrative operating expense ; in order to avoid such unpleasant event function hierarchies are used. It defines that it have alone properties and that may incorporate some other functions and that is \u201c One function may include the operations, constrains, and objects those are associated with another function \u201d ."
"with drugs primarily. Though Philippe Bourgois book is not about the problems of racism and ethnic discrimination, but about the underground economy of El Barrio with its effect on life of the rural inhabitants of East Harlem, the underlying foundation for the development of this type of economy was the social prejudice about Puerto Ricans and their abilities to function in the modern civilized society of whites."
"Parental divorce affects children\u2019s physical health and longevity (Physical Health). Those who experience parental divorce or separation are more likely to have health problems. Often in spite of maternal remarriage, such as a significant increase in injury rates, an increased risk of asthma, and increased risk of asthma-related emergencies.Children whose parents divorce are also more likely to contract cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract, the esophagus, anus, pancreas, lungs, and cervix. Researchers Kari Hemminki and Bowang Chen state, \u201cThe results show that offspring of divorced parents have increased cancer risks at tobacco-related, alcohol-related and sex-related sites.\u201d A Swedish study showed that young men with divorced parents had a slightly heightened risk of hospitalization and significantly increased risk of mortality."
"This means that this shooting was clearly influenced by hate and is also a sign of domestic terrorism. Allen also urges all Americans to support legislation and funding that will deal with the gun violence epidemic as well as the hate epidemic that is plaguing our country. On February 14, 2018, another mass shooting took place in Parkland, Florida. This shooting was caused by Nikolas Cruz and resulted in 17 deaths and 14 injured and 5 facing life-threatening injuries. In Peter Burke\u2019s article 17 killed in shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Burke goes on to quote one of the parents that was waiting for her son who said, \u201cI\u2019m so angry,\u201d \u201cHow many times does this have to happen?\u201d. This goes on to show that many of the parents are also urging for gun control laws to go in order because of the many recent school shootings. Many of the parents are wanting protection for their kids and to do this they want gun control to be more strict."
"Another study done by Berry and Sabatier ( 2007) compared the second generation immigrant youth in Paris, France and the second generation immigrant youth in Montr?al, Canada and their acculturation strategies and its effect on self-esteem. Researchers concluded that youth who preferred integration scored higher on self-esteem than those who preferred marginalization and this pattern was more prominent in Canada than in France. Berry et al. (2006) found that youth who prefer marginalization reported the highest amount of discrimination, whereas youth who prefer integration reported the least amount of discrimination. Youth who prefer separation reported moderately high discrimination, whereas those who prefer assimilation have reported moderately low discrimination. A comparison of different acculturation strategies at the individual levels of immigrants, second-generation, and third-generation Canadians with south Asian background has not yet been done. It is not just the psychological well-being of first-generation immigrants, but also second and third generation Canadians, who are impacted by four types of acculturation strategies and by achievement motivation."
"[22] A compensatory mechanism has also been used by courts.[23] When the Magistrate does not follow procedure with respect to entertaining complaint of custodial torture, it calls for interference by the High Court under Sec. 482 of the Code.[24] Another significant provision with respect to custodial torture leading to deaths is Sec. 176 of the Code where a compulsory magisterial inquiry is to take place on death of an accused caused in police custody. Sections 167 and 309 of the Code have the object of bringing the accused persons before the court and so safeguard their rights and interests as the detention is under their authorisation."
"A study conducted by Warn (2009) using Kolb\u2019s (1976) Learning Style Inventory concluded that there is no significant association between the students\u2019 learning styles and their academic performance (cited in Corbin, 2017). Researchers such as Garner-O\u2019Neale and Harrison, (2013), and Mlambo( 2012) have also explored learning styles and academic performance at the tertiary level. They reported that there was no significant or predictive relationship between learning styles and academic performance (cited in Corbin, 2017). In contrast, Abidin et al. (2011) conducted a study using Dunn and Dunn\u2019s (1986) Learning Styles Model and concluded that there is a significant relationship between learning styles and academic performance (Corbin, 2017). Recent research done by Khanal, Shah and Koirala (2014) indicated that students learning styles and approaches to study may have a significant bearing on their academic success."
"This quote, to me, represents a good mind-set of the idea that giving is better than receiving or getting. We all know giving helps others, but it\u2019s also good for the giver! A wealth of research proves that giving not only puts a big fat smile on your face but also triggers significant physical and psychological rewards. Here are some science-backed reasons on why giving is good for the mind, body and soul."
"A patient may fall and break his hip because he was not restrained despite poor mobility. Another reason nurses tend to use restraints is because of lack of support from management. As the nurses reported, even if they do their best, issues on short-staffing can still push them to use restraints as an aide to keep patients safe. (Lai, 2007) Another reason mentioned by Lai (2007) in her study is the constant pressure that nurses feel from management. Often it is the culture of the unit that dictates a nurse\u2019s willingness to restrain a patient. A ward that strives to keep fall incidents at a low would be happy to apply physical restraints on patients to achieve that goal."
"The way that society and the people in my life have defined race and ethnicity, social class, and gender have greatly affected how my life has developed thus far. They have shifted the way I view my roles as a mixed race, middle class, female. The things that I have experienced and learned have affected and will continue to affect the way I live the rest of my life. Society has a huge impact on our lives and will continue to change and shape the way we live throughout time. Our experiences in the social world are what make us who we are."
"As earth gets warmer, its consequences are evident, as shown in fig. 2 and 3, melting of ice allows for the rise of sea-levels, and if all of them were to melt, the world would be submerged in water, destroying habitats. Animals also suffer. Some move to cooler areas of the earth, while others experience a huge decline in numbers. For one, the habitat loss of the Ad?lie penguin in Antarctica allowed for its population to flunk up to 90%. This crisis is universal: it deals great damage to all, which means immediate action is needed."
"Autonomy means the right to have a choice without any external influence or interference by another person or institution, but also the moral responsibility. The moral responsibility does not interfere with freedom of choice but rather it is the approach to freedom. Freedom without responsibility is egoism, but responsibility without freedom is force. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution Guarantee this autonomy by introducing the concept of due process of law. This is the foundation upon which the court embarked upon when the court said that the right of privacy/autonomy is broad enough to encompass a women\u2019s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy."
"After identifying and reading the law sources I decided to approach the question in the following method: The very first thing was analysing the history and development of the registration Acts and Status since 1862 until 2012, with talking about the advancement of each Act and the objectives behind it."
"This means that people are starting to have to go through tests to make sure that they are not getting married just for the purpose of citizenship. However \u201cthe UK immigrants Advisory Service has already begun proceedings against this rule in the European court, on grounds of both racial discrimination an its attack on the right to marry according to choice and to live in the country of citizenship\u201d. (Jacobs 1075) There is much controversy over the issue but the one thing that is certain is that an extreme amount of racism and sexism is being used when dealing with these people. This reference is of value to my research because it shows how even though we might be trying to get non-citizens out of the country, we will never be able to do it properly until we are able to put aside the sexism."
"girlfriend who want it all , but don\u2019t blame her blame me because I was the stupid one who never knew wrong from right like I said I was still a little kid, but now that i am all grown up i realize my mistake for letting you go I should have fight for you, for us because back then I never realize how much you meant to me until you left, because each day that you were gone and not by my side I felt really lonely even my girlfriend and family could bring back the joy and happiness that we had, but I never meant to hurt you I just thought because no one could see you I could treat you any how I want, and since you were on my head I never thought you could leave me, and\u00a0am really sorry for that."
"According to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, the total number of illegal immigrant in America increases by 275,000 annually\u201d (Hayes 2000). United States is host to an illegal population of whom the vast majority are Mexican or Hispanic in origin. These illegal and uninvited guests help themselves to jobs, education, welfare and"
"The mental health of a woman is very important when it comes to raising a child. The process of pregnancy, childbirth, and even raising a child can cause a drastic decrease in a women\u2019s mental health because of the challenges they will have to face. Having a child is a life changing moment, and having a child they are not ready for can be very detrimental to a woman\u2019s health because it can cause regret, and anger. However, if a women is able to legally get an abortion, she will be much more likely to feel a sense of relief. Studies have shown that about 95% of women who received abortions believed that it was the right choice when asked about it a week later (ProCon, 2018). Mental health is a very serious topic, and if a women\u2019s mental health is declining after the birth of her baby, then this could drastically affect the care that the baby receives."
"Having the freedom of choice in clothing Shahana chose to wear a skirt, which is an article of clothing that exposes the legs. When Shahana walks past a group of boys they turn around \u201cShe looked at them and cocked her head. Nazeen wished that Shahana had her trousers on\u201d (Ali, 217). Choosing an article that exposes body parts strongly goes against the typical Bengali culture which proves that her choice in clothing is affected by the western society\u00a0that she lives in. Both authors use characters to inform that the first generation attempts to protect their cultural values while the second generation lets go of it, demonstrating their clashing ways of adjusting to changes due to immigration."
"Due to the difference in wealth African Americans are more susceptible to shock and are be unable to capitalize on certain opportunities making the next generation inherit less to. The cycle continues, and at it\u2019s core is the racially segregated neighborhoods most of us call home. African American homes do not grown as fast in value as white homes do. This is because people looking for a home generally look for amenities that would be found in white neighborhoods such as, parks, good schools, and nice views."
"Awareness is the key to stopping gang activity, many parents are not aware of the child\u2019s gang involvement. Most youths are reluctant to discuss it with their parents. This is why the community should learn to recognize the signs of gang activity and to take appropriate action. The first step is to recognize there is a gang problem. People who recognize the problem are better equipped to address the issue with their child, as well as not becoming victims of gang crimes. Communities must recognize the problem and work together to solve the problem. Structured after school activities, employment, awards for good grades, community outreach and organized youth activities help lessen gang activity."
"A rocky relationship what changes with the surroundings. In the young couple the relationship changes as the family become more involved in Cathy and Naraian\u2019s relationship. In \u201cThe Young Couple\u201d as the story progresses it becomes clear that the husband will not be able to find work without the help of his parents. Though the culture is still traditional and affectionate as families still provide \u201cplenty of pocket money (to their relations) to spend in restaurants, cinemas and record shops\u201d."
"This will require deliberate efforts from the company\u2019s management. Empowering the staff is vital in improving customer services. Zeithaml, V. (2000) asserts that investing in adequate human resource frameworks that increase the capacity of the staff is considerable in improving customer service relations. Training employees on the most proficient ways of serving customers are instrumental in developing viable communication links. This will consequently improve the company\u2019s relationship with its customers, who are imperative external stakeholders. Of importance still, investing in a highly empowered human resource will enhance the company\u2019s corporate identity by meeting its goals and objectives. Meeting the clients\u2019 needs by availing quality services will greatly help\u00a0in establishing a cohesive business relationship."
"It becomes a crime when a person persistently abuse substances to get a natural high or \u201cdrink away\u201d the pain hoping that all of their problems will just fade away. They begin to take them every time they are going through something and that leads to addiction. As a result, the teen will continue abusing drugs and they will began to commit more crimes."
"Their mission is similar my campaign which is to advocate for abused women and children and to ensure their safety by working locally and nationally to: offer support and a place of safety to abused women and children by providing refuges and other services, empower women affected by domestic violence to determine their own lives, recognize and meet the needs of children affected by domestic violence, promote policies and practices to prevent domestic violence and also raise awareness of the extent and impact of domestic violence in society."
"Racial profiling is not only an ineffective method of law enforcement, but it is also very dangerous and harmful for the minorities that are being unreasonably targeted. Many Americans who do not suffer from racial profiling themselves may ignore the effects of racial profiling and write them off as trivial annoyances. The truth is that racial profiling can cause severe psychological, emotional, and physical to those that are experiencing it directly. According to the Ontario Human Rights Commission \u201cThe American Psychological Association notes that research psychologists have studied the psychological effects of racial profiling and found that \u201cvictim effects\u201d of racial profiling include post-traumatic stress disorder and other forms of stress-related disorders, perceptions of race-related threats and failure to use available community resources.\u201d"
"Although I have partaken in numerous volunteer activities in previous years, I often found myself dreading service projects this year. Continual pressure and stress concerning my academics, my college applications, and my future heavily burdened me. I still volunteered and aimlessly rushed from activity to activity, but I did not receive the fulfillment that I hoped to find. This was when I decided to make time for one of my biggest passions: animals. Whether I am walking dogs, feeding cats, or entertaining birds, I feel radiant when I am around animals. Therefore, I decided to volunteer at the SPCA, a place I used to work at and a place that feels like my second home."
"We are also told that Roosevelt had introduced \u2018unemployment assistance and old age pensions, and he banned child labour. \u2018 This is in most peoples view a great step forward for America. We know that these issues are used in our government today, over 70 years on, which shows us these issues were obviously liked and continued to be liked up until this very day. It also explains how during Roosevelt\u2019s presidency the government had strengthened and expanded with its \u2018activities to help people. \u2018 One of the main oppositions to Roosevelt was on the grounds that the government had too much power."
"In addition, on page 6, Scout mentions, \u201cMen\u2019s stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning. Ladies bathed before noon, after their three-o\u2019clock naps, and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum.\u201d In this quote, Lee is implying that in Maycomb\u2019s society, men were busy and always at work. Women, on the other hand, did not work, so they slept, had free time to shower, and always stayed clean. This, again, restrained women from doing outdoor jobs and defined their role in Maycomb\u2019s community. It reiterates the stereotype that men go out and work hard, while women stay at home and take care of the house. This stereotype is still in place in our world today. The theme of femininity progresses throughout the novel, as shown on page 108, when Scout says, \u201cAunt Alexandra was fanatical on the subject of my attire. I could not possibly hope to be a lady if I wore breeches; when I said I could not do nothing in a dress, she said I wasn\u2019t supposed to be doing things that required pants. Aunt Alexandra\u2019s vision of my deportment involved playing with small stoves, tea sets, and wearing the Add-A-Pearl necklace she gave me when I was born; furthermore, I should be a ray of sunshine in my father\u2019s lonely life.\u201d This shows that girls in Maycomb were expected to be neat, elegant, and wear jewelry and dresses, not pants. Also, they were not supposed to play outside where they would get messy but rather play inside the house with tea sets. Scout is being pressured to act and dress differently, which is preventing her from being her true self and doing things she enjoys. Lee is showing that not only were women forced to act a certain way but so were young girls, who should have been enjoying their childhood. Aunt Alexandra\u2019s character portrays the ideal female in Maycomb and represents the expectations women and girls were required to meet. Aunt Alexandra\u2019s comments regarding Scout show the reader that girls had constraints everything from their clothing to what they did in their free time. The same stress put on girls for meeting their expectations of being female, is still pertinent in today\u2019s society, especially in teenage girls. For example, countless high school girls are pressured to look perfect and be skinny out of fear of being judged on their physical appearances. Along with gender roles, other aspects of life were also accentuated in Maycomb\u2019s community."
"She is someone I can lean on to at times of trouble. One whose fervent prayers have kept me safe from harm or sickness. She steers me from wrong, and leads me towards right. She has instilled in me the values of family life. And taught me to be a caring person."
"Now, onto the next scene of Mel Brook\u2019s film relating to race when the old lady tells Bart \u2018up yours n****r!\u2019 It is definitely towards his race. She is also standing above him and looks down on him as if he is nothing. As we do look at the scene we tend to notice that she is a racist white lady. It may also be because she is older and is used to how African-American people were used to be slaves during her time, even in the movie that is how they are portrayed as. She may have not been used to seeing a black man as her sheriff, and that is why she may have said what she said. As for the other scene that has the old lady in it, she states \u2018Sorry about the \u201cUp yours, n****r.\u201d I hope this apple pie will in some small way say thank you for your ingenuity and courage in defeating that horrible Mongo.\u2019 The old lady tries to apologize with a pie for her racist remark. Therefore you can tell that she ends up grateful for having a sheriff even if he is a black one."
"The sale of preowned games- customers get to enjoy the opportunity of buying pre-owned games from Game Stop. This is an offer that one can rarely find in other game shops in the US. The above-mentioned techniques are some of the reason why Game Stop shops are always flowing with customers. The trick used here is keeping customers happy to maintain good sales rates. From your shopping experience explain if the discounts you received on your purchase you feel was a bargain deal or do you feel you overpaid."
"At the beginning of The Road, when the man first woke \u201che\u2019d reach out to touch the child sleeping beside him\u201d to confirm the child\u2019s well-being. The man will \u201cread me [the boy] a story\u201d (McCarthy 7) and \u201cheld the boy close to him\u201d (McCarthy 29). The boy demonstrates great maturity as he cares for the man by reminding him to \u201cpour the hot water back [\u2026] and pour some of the cocoa into his own\u201d (McCarthy 34) and constantly reminding the man to take heed of his health."
"Capital punishment was used back in medieval times, ancient history, and the middle ages. In medieval and early modern Europe, before the development of modern prison systems, the death penalty was also used as punishment. While Henry VIII of England ruled, nearly 72,000 people were executed. In early modern Europe, great panic regarding witchcraft flooded Europe and the European colonies in North America. Widespread claims that Satanic witches were operating as an organized threat to Christendom to hurt Christians. As a result, thousands of people were executed for witchcraft and executed through witch trials during the early modern period. In Nazi Germany, there were many forms of capital punishment. Hanging, decapitation, and death by shooting, gassing, etc. Military organizations employed capital punishment as a discipline technique to soldiers that disobeyed laws. One method of execution has also been firing squad once guns became common amongst soldiers in Nazi Germany. More than one million Soviet citizens were executed during the Great Terror of 1937 to 1938, nearly all were executed by a single shot to the head face or neck. The Jewish citizens that lived in Nazi Germany at the time of Adolph Hitler faced various forms of capital punishments after being placed into concentration camps. Many were taken away from their families and as soon as they reached the camp were killed."
"However he has misinterpreted Biko\u2019s philosophy and political agenda at the outset. Biko\u2019s black consciousness means he wishes to end the perception of blacks that they are inferior to whites. However when he \u201cput some of these houghts down on paper\u201d he was immediately banned by the South African government merely for expressing a desire for equality."
"Another sociologist called Roseneil (2005) develops the idea of chosen your own family. She uses the term hetronorm to refer to the intimate relationship between a heterosexual couple is seen as normal. Cheal (2002) notes that many gays and lesbians are legally allowed to adopt nevertheless many want to retain status of difference because they may feel that by adopting a child they are being shaped or moulded to portray a heterosexual family. Another main reason in why same- sex families increase is the decline in secularisation because some religions condemn homosexuality and now less people are religious in the UK they are more acceptant of homosexuals. Another type of family is singletons; this means that when someone lives by themselves. About 3 in 10 household contains one person. The reasons for\u00a0these changes are the increase in separation and divorce has created more 1 person households especially with men under 65 because children are more likely to live with their mother. Also the decline in marriage and the trend in marrying later because people are living longer hence there are more people that are single. Stein (1976) argues the growing number of people choosing to be single is a deliberate choice."
"The Great Depression was a time of hardship for everybody especially ranch workers. It prevented people from living the life they desired. Many people lived in poverty switching between jobs. Eventually people, like Lennie and George, began searching for jobs in California, in fact \u201cthousands flocked to California\u201d. People were in search of jobs as migrant workers for fruit and vegetable fields. When there was an opening for one man, there would be at least ten men competing for it. They were willing to work for extremely low wages, even just for food."
"The structure and style of John Steinbeck\u2019s Of Mice and Men contribute to the conclusions which can be drawn from this novel, and this can be seen particularly in the novel\u2019s introductions, where it can be seen that the conclusions drawn are inherent. Two introductions in particular express the novel\u2019s conclusions: the introduction to the bunk house and its inhabitants, and the introduction to a death on the ranch, where conclusions about identity, loneliness, hope, and the inevitability of the failure of the American Dream during the Depression years are reflected."
"The death penalty should be eliminated because it does not allow for fair trials for the mentally ill. The mentally ill depending on the severity of their mental illness do not have fair trials when it comes to the sentencing of capital punishments. Many of these people are unfairly sentenced to death because of the mental illnesses that they suffer from. Instead of killing these people options to help them should be offered. For example, Vernon Madison was sentenced to death for the murder of an Alabama police officer in 1985 but due to his dementia, he was unable to recall the crime he committed and therefore that sets up an argument for if the death penalty should still be used. There is constant discussion about whether or not a prisoner\u2019s mental illness should give them protection from execution. The mentally ill are many times incapable of controlling themselves due to their mental illness so instead of putting these people to death for the heinous crimes they committed, they should be helped to deal with their mental illness. There is no way to account for one\u2019s mental illness and its effect on the crime committed therefore the death penalty should be all in all eliminated because it serves no purpose and it and is an unjustified end to the means."
"Discussing the next historical period, or it will be better to say during the World War I, the flow of Mexicans in the U.S. has increased in several times. Mexicans compensated the lack of American labor and became the main working force in the southern states\u2019 economy sector of the northern neighbor. In this case, some of them (immigrants from Mexico) were in the U.S. illegally. Then the status of illegal immigrants has not yet been officially established, and the Americans considered them \u2018fugitives\u2019 from Mexico. In 1924, was created the first in the southern U.S. Border Patrol, which was used to control illegal border crossings, and Mexican \u2018fugitives\u2019 officially acquired the status of illegal immigrants."
"I remembered there were times that I wanted to cry, to share how stressful I was with my mother, but then realized our unwell relationship. There were times that I fell and hurt, but it was my dad who bandaged for me. There were times that I even fought with my classmates, but it was dad who patiently listened to my reason. Home in my eyes became a place just to shelter from sun, cover from rain, rest from exhausting days. Joining as many clubs as I could be a way to avoid returning home."
"The Duke represents the traditional male and his attitude towards his late wife mirrors the attitude and expectations of a patriarchal and Victorian society towards women in his monologue. The society of that time expected women to simply obey. She should only reserve her charms for her husband. She must not even try to be beautiful in her own painting. The mere act of being happy, pleasant to anyone regardless of rank and stature in life, and to love the simple pleasures in life as watching the sunset or riding a mule in the case of the Duchess, were all considered acts of unfaithfulness."
"In a world with 95 million extra people per annum and with 35 million refugees, our immigration program can only help 1/10th of 1% of these people and then only at the expensive of our quality of life and environment. Foreign aid, not immigration is the logical way for humanitarian relief. Only genuine refugees in fear for their lives, should be granted temporary entry into Australia and then returned to their country of origin when the danger is passed. Economic illegal migrants, whether arriving in leaky boats or through our airports and falsely claiming refugee status, should be immediately deported."
"Overall, both stories express the motivation and strength that a brotherhood can give. Despite their similarities in overall theme, the two stories are different regarding the symbols that connect the brothers. In \u201cSonny\u2019s Blues\u201d, the factor that allowed Sonny and his brother to break the barrier between them was his music. Living in Harlem, there isn\u2019t many ways to express yourself or let yourself be heard, so music was an escape. Through Sonny\u2019s infatuation with music, his brother was able o see beyond his drug addiction and begin to start the re-birth of their relationship."
"As a result the most effective method to ensure that our own attitudes and beliefs do not hinder our work is to learn if we haven\u2019t done so already. Learn about one another\u2019s beliefs system, communicate not hate and through this understanding we can learn to respect one another as individuals. 2. 1 One particular learning activity that has greatly improved my understanding and as a result increased my productivity at work was time management training. A few years back I worked for an independent property management firm, I quickly recognized whilst working in a busy environment that managing time was a weakness of mine."
"A problem that can be rephrased into a need for a person of disability would be a person using a cane. Just because you have one doesn\u2019t mean that they are not able to walk it can mean that their foot might be sprained (Snow, 2009). However, if they have a physical disability like paraplegic we need to treat them with respect and ask permission if they require assistance."
"Sexual, physical and psychological violence causes as much illness and death among women aged 15 to 44 as cancer, while child sexual abuse is more common than teen pregnancy, pediatric cancer or childhood obesity, according to the Minnesota Coalition Against Sexual Assault. Given all the press lately about the issue of childhood obesity, we should remember there are many hidden issues facing our children today \u2014sexual violence is one of them. The American Medical Association has called it \u201cthe silent violent epidemic.\u201d"
"The second way is you can change your lamp with compact fluorescent bulb. According to a research in America, replace three frequently used light bulbs with compact fluorescent bulbs can save 300 lbs. of carbon dioxide and US$60 per year. A standard compact fluorescent bulb will save around one third of a tonne of greenhouse gas, along with the cost of six or more incandescent globes. You can use compact fluorescent bulb even more in your houses or offices and if you want, you can give them as ifts to family and friends. It is better if you can donate a set to a local charity to refit their office with compact fluorescent lights. In other hand, you must remember that compact fluorescent light bulbs do contain small amounts of toxic mercury. Therefore, proper disposal (recycling) is necessary to prevent any additional landfill contamination. In addition, you can also start looking into light emitting diode bulbs (LED light bulbs) which have started to crop up recently because they are even more efficient."
"The intent of this study is to understand the current state of affairs of racism within football. and look at what is get downing done to assist free the game of it. With legion regulating organic structures contained by athletics. it is cardinal to understanding what the chief organic structures choose to make to assist back the battle against racism. It seems as though it is going more and more of a human rights issue."
"At the time education progress, which had been increasing ceased and remained level for more than a three year period. This indicated that a quarter of young people aged 11, 16 and 19 were failing to reach a basic level of attainment. (Palmer, North, Carr and Kenway, 2003) The formulation of the Social Exclusion Unit indicates the Government had a clear understanding of social exclusion and an insight into the measures needed to be put in place to target the people most acutely affected by exclusion and reintergrating them back into society."
"Human Rights attorney Zia Ahmed Awan says that:\u201dthe underage marriages and\u00a0forced conversions \u00a0are blemish on the face of our society and all stakeholders including government need to take serious steps to end the menace,adding this sensitive issue mostly affects children and young people,it is also a grave violation of rights\u201d.(\u201cPakistan Press International; Karachi\u201d)(2017).He also held a press conference with the parents of a victim and emphasized that,if we want a change,we should start seeking it and work hard for it,and most importantly,is to start with campaigns and activities throughout which we are able to raise awareness for both parties:the parents and the victim.For example,\u201dthe national child protection authority in Sri Lanka has decided to cancel 300 marriages until the children reach the minimum limit age which is eighteen\u201d(\u201cDaily Mirror Colombo\u201d).A lot of NGO\u2019s have started to act to limit this problem and more specifically,they started to attack directly the main sources and origins that were causing Underage marriages to happen.Effective work has been conducted in order to limit poverty,raise awareness to parents who lack basic and minimal knowledge,creating more and more public schools for girls to continue their education for free;in addition to fundraising events to collect money to supply the young girls with the material that they need for their education(\u201cGirls not brides\u201d)."
"Anil tries to make him the way she is. He was a man \u201cencased in ice or metal, and she was banging on its surface in order to reach him, in order to let him out\u201d (264). Even at the end of their relationship, Anil does not allow him to have any control over her or her identity. She \u201cleft nothing of herself for him to hold on to\u201d (264). This show that her identity as an individual matter more to her than her past relationships which is with her ex-husband and her boyfriend Cillis. Due to that she left her husband and trying changing her Boyfriend as the way she wanted him to be."
"This can possibly be a cause for the high rates of unemployment given the fact that immigrants are a source of cheap labour and employees who get the opportunity may prefer to employ illegal immigrants as opposed to locals whose wages and salaries are usually higher than those of the immigrants. Conclusion The idea about introduction of national identity cards is a noble one given the fact that the government has taken all possible measures to make sure that the identification cards will only be used for the benefit of the citizens but not as a source of discriminatory treatment based on ethnicity, color, race, religion or social status."
"Furthermore, the composition of the story would change because of the leading authority of men who are entitled to be leaders in society. Therefore, the speaker would be changed from a mother to a father who understands the roles of leading. The mothers are displayed as soft beings, while fathers in the setting would be ruthless with much authority as compared to the women. The son should not be weak like girls but should be hardened to make them responsible for taking heavy duties like leadership and protecting the family. The girl was told by the mother to take care of her fragile body \u201cdon\u2019t walk bare-head in the hot sun\u201d (Kincaid 1). If the advice were to a son, the speaker would tell him to walk on the bare sun to harden his body to the weather because he can withstand the harsh conditions as a man and a boy he is at the moment. The father would be the best parent to advise the son who understands the patriarchal aspect better than the woman who spent her time serving and pleasing men and precisely her husband."
"The assistants are allocated to the children who have been identified as having a specific special educational need. The assistants help to ensure the child can do the work he/she is given; they spend one on one time with their allocated child to make sure the work is explained in a way they understand. The assistant is always there to help the child with any questions they have on their set tasks. This has a positive impact on the child and makes them feel a sense of belonging in the school setting, as well as ensures their right to an education is being met. It also makes sure everyone has the same opportunities regardless of ability. It allows them to meet their goals and achieve set targets just like their peers. The staff and children celebrate different cultural holidays such as Christmas, Diwali, Easter and Chinese New Year. For example, when the school is celebrating Easter they take a full week and dedicate it to fun activities surrounding the Easter story. This educates children of all backgrounds on a very highly celebrated occasion and the real meaning behind Easter. This has a positive impact because it shows that everyone in the school setting is respected by all no matter what background they come from. This also educates children about other religious aspects and different cultural beliefs. It teaches them to respect others and their traditions, helping to create a sense of belonging within the setting for those pupils who belong to these different cultures."
"The is 16% while the rate for men is 40%. In this study, 64% of women and 38% of men have never attended school. The leading cause of girls not going to school is early marriage, while for boys it is the high cost of school fees. In 2013, about 45% of girls were married before the age of 18. When marrying, men are required to pay a \u2018bride-price\u2019 to the bride\u2019s family. It is very common to receive cows as a bride-price. This is an incentive for families to sell their daughters when they are struggling economically."
"In chapter 4 our author deals with rationalized racism. The absurd idea that race determines IQ and IQ determines economic status. In order to become part of mainstream white society it seems that blacks must learn how to disassociate themselves with their blackness and live up to the cliches that surrounds us by White America. The fact that a young white male equates being black with knowing how to play basketball is sad. The stereotype that all blacks are good in sports such as basketball is clearly exhibited on pg. 50. The fact that the mother agreed with her child is even more sickening. The fact that blacks get taxed by White America to be part of America is a disturbing find. To live in the nice neighborhoods blacks get taxed more than whites, in order to be part of certain social organizations the fees are raised for the black that is interested. Mrs. Williams states that \u201cracial division has become big business for America, whether it is news,\u00a0sports or entertainment\u201d (pg.58) These issues are considered controversial so if America feeds in to it and plays the race card with these issues the masses will tune in."
"Hence, most commercial leases which are usually for an average of 15 years to be registered. Therefore, the act increases situations where unregistered land must be registered. To add to this, Lord Chancellor is given statutory power to amend events that raise compulsory first registration under section 4 of LRA 2002. The older act which provided cautions against first registration in a manner where if an individual having some interest in the land would be notified if an application has been made for the land\u2019s first registration."
"Many believe that because of the federal government\u2019s negligence to face immigration responsibilities the states are scrambling. States have a long history of enacting immigration laws. In 1996, after Congress denied welfare to most legal immigrants, states stepped in with laws to provide safety-net services. After the September 11 attacks, state lawmakers passed bills aimed at protecting national security. People were concerned about dangerous immigrants in their midst and thought they should take matters into their own hands. The increase in state laws parallels the changing settlement patterns of undocumented immigrants. Between 1990 and 2008, illegal immigration slowed significantly in California but grew in Georgia, North Carolina and other states because those states are not the typical immigrant-receiving states and therefore are not accustomed to having large immigrant populations."
"The quantity of blacks in prison far outweighs their extent of society. Justice that is blind to both condition and status which can have an oppressive impact.\u00a0 minority adolescents will probably be burdened in the adolescent justice system, in this way making an aggregate record of impediment over the existence course police attentiveness results in higher capture for minorities the War on Drugs, and other \u2018get extreme\u2019 legislation established since the 1980s at the state and government levels weakness African Americans constant, unwarranted sentencing inconsistencies and in addition differentials in rates of incarceration show racial biases and straightforwardly or by implication, the death penalty targets blacks. Gender roles have likewise made a relatively unbreakable association among women and beauty."
"There are two major themes in \u2018of mice and men\u2019 novel that is foreshadowed by the reference to Robert Burns\u2019 poem called \u201cTo a mouse\u201d the word mouse within the title means loneliness and dreams. (BBC Bitesize, 2014:2) This poem contains the lines, \u201cThe best laid plans of mice and men/ often go awry\u201d Most of the main characters in \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d harbour dreams and have plans that never come true. George, Lennie, and Candy all share a doomed dream of buying their own farm and living off the land."
"Heron et al (2006) examined factors affecting infant mortality and its social impact in Africa. Nobles et al (2003) demonstrated the relationship of expenditure on health outcomes, specifically IMR. Peck (2003) augmented the discussion by strengthening argument on delivery of health initiatives with the role of the public service and its provision. Cramer (1997) in his study provided the measure by which health contributes to the wellbeing of the society. He drew relationships between health initiatives and their outcomes between the West and African nations; statistically producing representations on the impact of these initiatives."
"Music is an important part of early childhood development. Market your musical skills at day cares, kindergartens and preschools. Call day-care directors, school principals and teachers. Sometimes you may have to schedule a free first performance to get paid for ensuing performances. They like to see how the kids interact with your music before scheduling you on a regular basis."
"To witness the improvement is a priceless matter and should give the volunteer the feeling of unconditional giving. Making a difference in someone\u2019s life gives personal satisfaction and helps teens develop a better appreciation for the little things in life (Keeler). Community service is the voluntary work intended to help people in a particular area. It should never be mistaken with a paid job or a guaranteed career. Volunteers can help communities save money by allowing them to spend the money on local improvements rather than using the funds to hire help."
"This feeling now has a name.A couple weeks later we saw a example of police brutality again. This time a truck full of illegal aliens from Mexico. Deputies in Riverside chased the pickup on the freeway. The illegal immigrants threw beer bottles at the deputies. When the truck finally stopped, the immigrant in the back of the truck fled. Three Riverside Deputies then went after the driver and his passenger. The driver was thrown against the hood and handcuffed. The passenger, a pregnant women was grabbed when she did not stop running, was clubbed repeatedly with a nightstick. The officers didnt even notice that a news helicopter was hovering above them recording everything live on television. {Streisand 10} Not every police beating is fortunate enough not to end without any major injuries. Take Jonny Gammage for example, a cousin of Pittsburgh Steeler Defensive End Ray Seals. Gammage had just finished having lunch with his cousin Seals."
"A mechanistic model ran the divisions in the United States, where Shoemate ran all operations as CEO. Mechanistic models provide a stable workplace and a noticeable chain of command (Robbins, 2005, p. 468). The problem with the mechanistic model is the lack of involvement in decision-making by the lower level employees. With \u201cinvisible barriers\u201d that restrain diverse employees from moving up the corporate ladder, important viewpoints are absent in critical company judgments."
"This is a dramatic change of word as corporal punishment used to be accepted and meant that pupils would be cained or whipped for their wrong \u2013 doing, whereas capital punishment was abolished in 1965 because it meant certain death. Therefore, the suggestion that children should receive the death penalty for minor acts in the school means that Roger McGough\u2019s \u2018The Lesson\u2019 is ironic and is to be taken light-heartedly."
"Uncle Sam looks weak and frail, but also very unsure and scared that FDR does not know what he is doing and cannot heal him. His hands are locked with his thumbs up which can mean that he is also hoping and praying that he will be healed but also that he is waiting. He is waiting for FDR to come up with something that once and for all will heal him, but FDR cannot come up with this as he is in endless confusion. FDR with his endless confusion has just kept spending money on getting these remedies for America but none are working and the question is asked, when will the table be full?"
"If an incident was to happen in the setting, it would be reported to a senior member of staff. The staff would then deal with the incident. It would be recorded on an incident form which would be signed by a witness and by a parent. The incident form is then kept in an incident folder which is kept safely and is easily accessible to the staff members."
"As there are only twenty families I may not get a clear enough pattern so my results may be hard to summarise. My time will be limited therefore I may have problems doing the primary and secondary research. The primary evidence is most valuable because I can compare it to existing evidence but I am implementing primary evidence after I have researched secondary evidence. I may not be able to compare my results to Botts as she studied working class families whereas my study will use middle class households. If my results differ considerably I will have to research sociologists who studied middle class households."
"It was called the Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin. (Document 7) The books and lecturers purpose was to help abolish slavery because it gave an understanding of how slavery was like. Segregation was a social change that occurred as a result of Reconstruction and has affected a lot of the South. African Americans in the South and sometimes in the North used different facilities."
"The purpose of this paper is to examine the results of parental involvement in a child\u2019s academics. Celebrated Doctor and Director, Dr. Joyce L. Epstein made massive contributions to the early childhood education field with her research on the six types of involvement. The six types of involvement that she supports and are later discussed in this paper are parenting, communication, volunteering, learning at home, decision making, and collaborating with the community. Each type of involvement has different practices which result in different outcomes for the students, parents, and teachers."
"The act of immigrating to a new country can profoundly affect a person\u2019s social identity. Within a country, the individual is at least given a chance to be himself. He may be treated with contempt because of his social class or gender but he at least knows the social rules of the country to understand why. However, when he immigrates to another country, he will not be familiar with many of the social rules. It is most likely he will not only meet contempt because of his class or gender but also because of his ethnic origin. Bilton gives the example that a West Indian immigrating to Britain in the 1960\u2019s would undoubtedly have faced serious ethnic and racial\u00a0discrimination."
"Excessive personal details such as current location or expensive items purchased should be avoided on social networking sites. If your personal pages are available to the public and you are constantly updating your current whereabouts, this can be an invitation for a thief to enter your home when they are confident that you are currently away. When using a public Wi-Fi, sensitive information should not be sent over the network unless it is encrypted. There is great potential for your data to be compromised by a cyber-attacker."
"In conclusion, the effects of racism diminish the chances of an equal, free and prosperous life. Things have only escalated over the course of these years, I don\u2019t know when things will change, I don\u2019t know how they\u00a0will change. But what I do know is that I hope and I try to make a difference to change things and so do other people, maybe change is right around the corner or maybe we have to fall before we can stand back up again. Change will come, Discrimination will end and when it does it will hopefully be everlasting."
"In the entire novel, the author attempts to portray the both sides of the War without any bias and to highlight the real causes of the War. Shaara uses Harrison, a spy who was hired by General Longstreet to investigate on the actions of the Union forces. This ensures that he remains neutral in his narration of the War. Thus, it can be argued that Michael Shaara was motivated by the urge to bring out the unbiased facts about the Gettysburg War, the real issues that led to the War, and the significance of the War to America\u2019s history."

"The poem deals with a foul subject, that of racism and prejudice, in a lighthearted, almost comical manner. A most important device which Soyinka has used to highlight this sense of racism, which was previously widespread in western society, is that of the telephone. Had the person been speaking face to face with the lady, this whole conversation would never have taken place. She would have either refused outright, or would have found a more subtle way of doing so. The whole back and forth about \u2018how dark\u2019 the man is wouldn\u2019t have occurred."
"This does not concern just immigrants, but also people of Hispanic descent. Latinos are moving away from the west and southern areas of the states that consist of a smaller Latino population, which increases the chances to become a victim of racial profiling. The results of has a negative impact for Latinos with their mistrust and lack of interaction with law enforcement due to their fear of officials asking about their immigration status."
"Varying methods of naturalisation persist among contemporary international society. Many states employ citizenship tests in order to fashion their own requirements for citizenship. However, with the rise of multiculturalism, citizenship tests have frequently been viewed as contentious methods of integration. Those who oppose citizenship tests assert that these trajectories solely serve to assimilate migrants and do not do enough to maintain and embrace their original cultural roots."
"The main vital arguments for reintroducing corporal punishment is that it is believed that it will decrease bad behaviour in the classroom. In a survey carried out by the telegraph, it shows that 20.3% of teachers feel that it should be reintroduced as bad behaviour has increased and it can be argued that the core of this problem is due to the abolishment of corporal punishment. If a child is misbehaving and interrupting the entire classes learning, would the most effective punishment really be a quick telling off, for them to just go back to their smug friends and plan their next interruption? No."
"The processes exerting the highest influence on invasion success at small scales are biotic ones (Fridley et al. 2007). The main drivers of so-called biotic resistance are competition, predation, herbivory and disease. Though, most studies focused on competition (Levine et al. 2004). In theory, highly diverse communities tend to repel invaders because resource availability is low, and niches are already occupied by natives (Gallien et al. 2017). On the contrary, Richardson & Py?ek (2006) argue that species-poor communities are found in low -resource environments, which are naturally less invisible due to less favourable conditions."
"and those who are absolutely opposed to the Death Penalty need not be addressed in my paper as neither side is going to care what I have to say. This leaves me with a target audience consisting of individuals who haven\u2019t decided where they stand on the Death Penalty, and those whose opinions differ from mine in terms of the times a life-ending sentence should be carried out."
"Curleys\u2019 wife both talks and acts playfully and flirtatiously in front of the other workers. In my opinion she behaves in this manner because her sex is her only weapon to gain attention. Steinbeck could have been trying to make a point of her actions being relative to the era she lived in. I believe he deliberately portrayed her in this light with the intentions of making the reader feel sympathetic towards her in later chapters, but also to make the reader feel apologetic and penitent for labeling and being prejudice towards her."
"He feels like he\u2019s finally part of society by somehow having control and being part of something. In some sense, the Brotherhood can be compared to a for-profit organization in which an organization claims to stand for something larger but can be seen as a greedy imposter with their own agenda in mind. All they want to do is get more attention and pretend they\u2019re interested in something to gain an audience."
"American governance must continue to be responsible and accountable so as to ensure that human rights and fundamental freedoms are available to all people; citizens, immigrants and illegal immigrants alike. These guarantees are essential for the effective prevention and elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. The battle to eliminate must take a three-prong approach. First, current racist action must be suppressed and penalized. Secondly, there must be a concerted effort to prevent future racist attitudes and actions."
"Often time the food was so bad and uncommon that the internes opted not to eat it, because they could hardly stomach it (Ewers, 3). \u201cBoth children and adolescents complained the most about the quality of the bland, sometimes unsanitary, food\u201d which often led to stomach cramps and diarrhea (Tong,14). As if it was not bad enough that cultural foods were replaced with slops, the families were also banned from using chopsticks. The fact that spoons and forks were allowed, but no chopsticks, works to showcases the attempt to breakdown the Japanese culture. \u201cIt is apparent that immigrants were expected to shed their prior cultural identity in order to become good citizens (Rentelin, 634).\u201d All in all, Otsuka\u2019s novel gives great insight as to how internment camps worked to strip the Japanese of their self, physical, and cultural identity."
"Black-on-black crimes usually happen because of the treatment that the Black Americans get from the society. If we open about our racial differences, Black-on-black crimes would be lessened\u2014at least. We would just usually smirk if we hear stories of crimes committed by Blacks on their fellow Blacks. Our mind set is that, we are not affected, anyway."
"Sarah and Angelina Grimke were the first Southern women to become influential abolitionist, which spoke on the end of slavery; as well as social and political equality for freedmen and women as well. The Grimke sisters stretched the boundary of women\u2019s public role, by giving speeches to audiences with men and women, and by speaking in front of a state legislature about African American rights. Sarah and Angelina broke many of the social and political boundaries subjected on women. Sarah Moore Grimke was born in Charleston, South Carolina on November 26, 1792 and Angelina Emily Grimke was born on February 20, 1805 in Charleston, South Carolina."
"Education is an essential element for me to achieve in order for myself to become a well- rounded individual. My current university has afforded me the opportunity of establishing my goals, and now I am ready to take the next step of my journey. The pinnacle of the academic achievement is Vanderbilt. Being able to participate in this diverse and intellectually stimulating community will bring out the best of talents."
"They may get into fights at school or in the neighborhood. As they get older, these children are less and less understanding of their mother. Some may begin to verbally or physically abuse her as they have seen their fathers do. Girls in particular may learn that being a victim is inevitable and see no way out of the pattern. As adolescents, girls may begin dating and become involved in relationships which grow to be abusive. They accept threats, controlling behavior and violence from their boyfriends. Children may live in shame of the hidden violence and be embarrassed by the family secret."
"Cassie experiences some hard times at Strawberry herself when Big Ma decides to allow Stacey and Cassie to accompany her to this festival. It turns out to be a day of disappointments and humiliation, starting with the town itself which does not live up to her expectations. Then Cassie is confused by Big Ma\u2019s choice of pitch at the far and least accessible end of the market. Big Ma explains to her that the best positions are reserved for \u2018them\u2019s white folks\u2019 wagons\u2019. We see from this that whites feel they are more superior and therefore are prejudiced against blacks, who according to them are of a lower class and do not deserve much."
"This article would be considered a secondary source. It gives us a view of what others saw and thought Ruby was going through while attempting to support the integration of schools. Another article that was from a primary source was from the website NPR, which included an interview with Ruby Bridges talking about her personal experience and how she felt during that time. Looking at these two articles it became clear to me that both articles were talking about the same event and had some similarities, but there were also many differences."
"Resembling this all of the time, in what ever the story it is, always pictures that you would be the little fast one with sharp features. Lennie is the guy that is tall and always does what he is informed and has an ill-defined, strong, and effective body and does not know his own strength. Steinbeck describes him as the one with no shape in his face and his body. Lennie drags his feet when he strolls and acts like an animal. In the descriptions of these 2 men their appearance is totally various. George dresses cool and tidy, while Lennie gowns extremely shabby."
"By writing learning diary, I have learned to correct my actions, if they were not right before. It helped me to be respectful to others. This has increased my understanding of living in a multicultural society in a way that is learning from others. I have learned to become more helpful for someone in need. By writing the activities of every day, I have learnt about the behavior of different people. I have analyzed the attitudes in view of the culture of the people. I have learned to understand the ways of life in different cultures. I have come to know about the value and standard of food, dress, behavior, living style, and religion in different societies."
"People have noted that \u201cthese missions today and into the future require our force to include the broadest possible spectrum of ideas, perspectives, and experiences\u201d1. This is especially true when it comes to the vast amounts of overseas destinations that our civilians can work at and that our troops can deploy to."
"It is concluded, then, that abortion is justified in these cases (Beckwith). Many people against abortions see the fetus as a distinct human being with its own right. They believe abortion cannot be justified because it is killing an innocent human being (RSrevision). Arguments include: Every child is a precious and unique gift from God, we have no right to destroy this, children with physical or learning disabilities can lead full and rewarding lives, and aborting people because of disability is like telling disabled people that they are worthless."
"Biologic studies in children are difficult to implement since they often require several blood draws, subjects remaining still more long periods of time, and the overall cooperation of the children and adolescents. Three types of investigation have provided information on possible developmental differences in the neurobiology of depression. The first is the study of Cortisol secretion, measured by investigations such as the dexamethasone suppression test (Rapoport, 2000 p.230)."
"On the other hand, \u2018The Negro\u2019s Complaint\u2019, was written in 1788 when slavery was still legal, therefore, Cowper\u2019s poem was seen as very controversial at the time when it was written. \u2018Still I Rise\u2019 was written many years after the slave trade was abolished but nevertheless, white people were segregated from the blacks in this very racist time. Obviously the main theme of the poem is: the effects of slavery, the treatment of blacks, and racism."
"Most children with febrile seizure do not experience further febrile seizure, but one third will. More than half of the risk is realized during the first year after the initial febrile seizure and over 90% recur within two years. A family history of febrile seizure in a first degree relative is associated with an increased risk of recurrence."
"In the novel, mice and men are both shown to be incredibly fragile and breakable. Lennie loves to pet soft things so his Aunt would give him mice to pet, \u201cAn\u2019 she stopped givin\u2019 \u2019em to ya. You always killed \u2019em (9)\u201d. Lennie accidentally killed them because he didn\u2019t realize how fragile they were. George and Lennie had a dream that made them both happy but the dream was so fragile that it collapsed immediately when Lennie killed Curley\u2019s wife. The men\u2019s dream and the mouse are similar because they were so fragile that they broke when one thing went wrong."
"The capacity to love is impacted if we always expect to receive something from others in return. In that case, inner self lacks sufficient feelings of love and concern for other person. If we think of giving something to others in love, it requires that we are satisfied with what we have possessed. It helps to generate love for others, if we are calm and at peace with our self. The capacity of a person to give something in love does not always depend on his or her material belongings but the willingness and character of that person. Giving something does not mean offering only material possessions. We have to be good at heart to be able to give something to others in token of love and concern. If a person has willingness to give something precious to others, he or she has capacity to love others. When we think of giving to other person, we care for that person. It could be offering good advice, praises, genuine sympathy or any other help that he/she need at that material time. When mother or father loves a child they are actually taking care of the child."
"Asses the effects on those using the services of three different discriminatory practices in health and social care settings Sexuality: If a homosexual couple were recommended to not foster children, and this did cause them to lose confidence in adopting, it could lead to depression and anxiety at their status in society. They may then feel it necessary to hide their sexual orientation. This could then make them feel unworthy in life which could lead to severe depression. Social class: If a former prisoner in the care home did feel isolated, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if they may rarely join into group activates. This would ultimately lower their self-confidence and mean that they would withdraw more over time. If this was to happen, they could find themselves being depressed and having very low self-esteem. Religion: If a Muslim woman was forced to be treated by a male doctor, even after asking not to be, she would be unable to use the service, purely because of her religious beliefs. This would be discriminatory practice. She would then feel humiliated, which would ruin her self-confidence. If this happened then she may not have the confidence to use the health service again which could end up with serious consequences."
"WHAT IS DIFFERENT BETWEEN COMMUNITY SERVICE AND CORPORATE SERVICE RESPONSIBILITY? Difference between community service and corporate service is in the community. Community service mostly from among student who become a volunteer to a program. While corporate service responsibility is to provide sponsorship or assistance through the company money to develop their companies. For example, give sponsorship to student who wishes to continue their studies abroad while promoting their company. Community service most them from clubs in the university or have create event for subject community service."
"If anything, we can sympathise with him, which makes the description of his mad bout that much harder to read or hear. In \u2018Hippolytus\u2019, the title character comes across as a very \u2018holier than thou\u2019 arrogant little man that actually we\u2019re not all that sad to see him dead. Harsh, but true in a lot of peoples minds. However, some would argue that it is Theseus that is the character that we can fully sympathise with. He acts as any angry and hurt man would when he finds his wife hung holding a note accusing his son as the man who raped her. He acted irrationally and understandably so."
"Compared to traditional adoption, embryo adoptive parents have legal rights and responsibility for the embryos prior to birth. This gets rid of the possibility that the genetic mother could change her mind and decide to keep and rear her child. Since embryo adoption has remained largely unregulated, private organizations have developed some guidelines of their own. These organizations have relied on the best interests standard, used in traditional adoption proceedings, to restrict potential parents whose adoption of an embryo, according to these organizations, would not be for the best of the frozen offspring (Batsedis, 2003). Under either contract or adoption law, private organizations may reject customers they deem to be \u201cunacceptable\u201d applicants, such as non-Christian or same-sex couples. Other restrictive qualities are income, age of the parents, citizenship, and more."
"Apparently she was supposed to be cleaning the house and doing the grocery shopping since my former husband did not think that his children needed food. When the divorce trial became a reality, she not only would not testify on my behalf, she would not answer her phone. My attorney told me that if she was called to testify, she would be a hostile witness and possibly harm my case more than it was already harmed. My former husband\u2019s attorney was the assistant District Attorney who happened to play golf with the presiding Judge. On the advice from my attorney she was not called, I lost my daughters to my former husband; he was working and had a good income."
"Beach people are generally active and highly energetic in their daily lives, whereas people who love mountain vacations are more of balanced travelers who love to be around nature. As far as social behavior is concerned, a beach person is observed to be more of a social butterfly, in contrast to a mountain person who chooses to be a mountain monk. While the beach person may be very carefree and cheerful in nature, the mountain person may appear to be very calm and composed. In terms of activities, one can experience mountain climbing, hiking, skiing, etc., on the mountains, while on beaches, people get engaged in activities such as swimming, water sports, playing volleyball, music, nightlife, etc."
"The Confederacy also had minimal factory production and industry. At the beginning of the war, the Confederacy had only one-ninth the industrial capacity of the Union. But that statistic was misleading. In 1860, the North manufactured 97 percent of the country\u2019s firearms, 96 percent of its railroad locomotives, 94 percent of its cloth, 93 percent of its pig iron, and over 90 percent of its boots and shoes. There was not even one rifleworks in the entire South."
"Critics of either of these methods, specifically the practice of sexual abstinence are quick to argue that telling teens to be abstinent is by no means realistic. However, there is evidence, in the form of a slight decrease in teen pregnancies, that this is wrong. While abstaining from sexual relations may be difficult for some, it is not so difficult for others, as they understand that they must make a life for themselves and their future families rather than going ahead and going and getting pregnant at the age of 15 or 16 years old, which is always a risk that occurs during sexual relations. Furthermore, some argue that sexual relations are the only way to fully know their partner or share love with their partner and show them their feelings. However, this is not the case. As stated by an article by the American Pregnancy Association, there are other ways to show romantic partners love and have intimacy in the relationship besides solely having sex and risking the chance of a pregnancy at a young age (Abstinence). These ways include talking and listening to each other, sharing joys, hurts, dreams, goals, wishes and other aspects of their lives, having honesty and respect for one another, and lastly, having fun and playing together."
"First, in this patriarchal society, it has taken for granted that women are destined by their biology to be in charge of the home kitchen. Even a few years ago, \u201ca wife who did not cook for her husband was looked at askance\u201d (Whitney); a mother who did not cook for her children was an abomination. In contrast, it would be a special case if a man is good at cooking, and he is regarded as a professional. When done in the home, \u201ccooking is associated more with women than men, but professional, high-status cooking has remained the domain of men despite inroads women have made into other traditionally male-dominated careers\u201d (Broyles). It is regarded that only men have the technique, discipline, and passion that makes cooking consistently an art. In other words, women are incapable of elevating cooking to an art."
"Families were separated through the method of shopping for and merchandising slaves. Whereas not all Africans in America were slaves, an oversized variety were, significantly within the southern states. For those Africans in America United Nations agency were free, discriminatory laws that barred them from owning property and ballot, to Illustrate, yet because the belief within the intrinsic inferiority of dark-skinned peoples by the dominant white majority, control them back from full equality within the us. Although slavery was ultimately illegal and laws prohibiting discrimination against African-Americans passed, racism against this community remains and is manifested in additional delicate ways that nowadays."
"IEP\u2019s, the history of resources and laws for individuals with exceptionalities is clearly explained with descriptive details and data to support the process. In chapters one through four, it explains the valuable information pertaining to the laws, the IEP process and the significant stakeholders involved in implementing services for exceptional students, understanding the three tiers for interventions that may collect data to help support an IEP, and setting long term goals that will set up the exceptional student for success on objectives that will set them up to their on individual needs for the purpose of success."
"And what is society doing to make the youngsters of the Maori race feel like they do not belong in society? By reading and viewing these texts, \u2018Noughts and Crosses\u2019, \u2018Chinese Whispers\u2019, \u201cPatches Hide No Scars\u2019 and \u2018On the Sidewalk Bleeding\u2019, I have learnt of the struggles and pressures many people, fictional or not, suffer through due to the prejudices of modern society. \u201cAnd just like that, I\u2019d been assessed and judged. Nurse Fashoda didn\u2019t know the first thing about me but she\u2019d taken one look at my face and now she reckoned she knew my whole life story. \u201d"
"Jesus was the epitome of what a teacher with a diverse student body needs to do. He taught in parables imbued with illustrations familiar to the daily lives of all the people in his audience, who had a diversity of experiences. By teaching through stories, of shepherds, fishermen, seasons of growth and harvest, rich men, servants, kings and slaves, he was able to impart the same message, to a diverse audience, so that all could relate to, and understand according to their own experiences."
"Respect is an important value in any professional organization, especially in the military. Giving respect to an NCO is an important role as a soldier in the United States military. NCO\u2019s have earned the respect throughout the years of service given. Also, by proving to their chain of command that they have the ability to lead soldiers both on and off the battlefield. They have gone to schools and put in the hard work that is required to lead soldiers by mentoring them."
"The views of the child are given weight according to the maturity and age of the child. A child can participate in the sense of taking part or being present or participate in the sense of knowing that one\u2019s actions are taken note of and may be acted upon. The extent to children\u2019s participation will vary between and within societies (CRC, 2006)"
"But if we look back, we will realize that the war was even more than slavery noticing that many decades after the war there are still racist conflicts between whites and blacks. It is still a problem of who has more rights to be an \u201cAmerican\u201d. If we look back, we can realize that presidents like Washington and Lincoln himself who was the author of the act of emancipation and who attributed the liberation of slaves in the country were slave owners themselves."
"Gwendolen is mainly respected because she is part of the Bracknell family, who seem to be rich with a large house, and her mother wants the \u2018best\u2019 for her. She is also old fashioned when it comes to a marriage proposal, as Jack says \u201cwe must get married at once\u201d and although Gwendolen has practically said yes she insists that Jack proposes properly by getting down on one knee and asking \u201cGwendolen, will you marry me?\u201d Of course Gwendolen says yes. We learn that when Gwendolen was a little girl she had dreams of marrying someone called Ernest, and thinks that the \u201conly safe name is Ernest\u201d. She also mentions that the first time she heard that Algernon, her cousin, had a friend named Ernest, she knew she \u201cwas destined to love him\u201d. Although Gwendolen isn\u2019t the most intelligent woman as she really doesn\u2019t care about money, appearance or lifestyle, as long as the man she is with is called Ernest."
"To participate in the Illinois preschool program youth must meet eligibility. 75% of the children enrolled must be 4 years old by September 1st, and in families 200% of the Federal Poverty Line. Children who are given preference include children from homeless families, children from families below 50% of the Federal Poverty Line, Children involved with the child welfare system, and children with IEP\u2019s (Illinois State Board of Education, 2018)."
"Scout also decides that she wants to start to make a change. Scout refuses to use hurtful terms and learns not to judge others before she gets to fully know them. When people learn to accept others for who they are, or even taking the time to sit and consider what it is like to be that person, they fully do not understand how they effect and seriously hurt others. If people sat down and considered the consequences of their actions and words, people would connect to each other better. As the great character Atticus Finch once said, \u201cYou never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view \u2013 until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.\u201d"
"For the Spanish: Spain, as it has been observed, is a nation-state born out of religious struggle mainly between Catholicism and Islam, but also against Judaism (site) The culture of Spain is a European culture based on a variety of influences. These include the pre-Roman cultures, mainly the celts and the Iberians cultures; but mainly in the period of Roman influences. In the areas of language and religion, the Ancient Romans left a lasting legacy. The subsequent course of Spanish history also added elements to the country\u2019s cultural development. [\u2026] Spain became an almost entirely Roman Catholic country and Catholicism became their state religion in 1851. (Culture of Spain, Wikipedia. org) For the Filipinos, their God, Bathala was the supreme god of the pre-Spanish Filipinos."
"Training children is fundamental to guarantee great habits and conduct. Kids are progressively helpless to terrible impacts and will in general gain from their encompassing condition. They consequently need direction and steady supervision. Hitting a youngster isn\u2019t illegal in many spots. Be that as it may, guardians who use it in their homes blamed for children misuse."
"If a woman is at a risk of dying or becoming severely handicapped, due to the pregnancy, she should have the choice especially if she has other children to look after. Abortion is not murder, as it only destroys a collection of cells, which cannot survive out side the mother\u2019s womb."
"Immigration caused labor demands to rise fueling the economic expansion. The approximately 4 million immigrants who migrated to America had a variety of motivating factors. Irish Potato Famine, European economic conditions, religion and politics are all some of the reasons immigrants were making the voyage to the America in such large numbers. Most immigrants during this time were German or Irish. Generally Germans came to America more skilled workers and the Irish were unprepared fleeing famine forcing them to fill low-wage laboring jobs. Eventually Nativism would rise in the 1840\u2019s and 50\u2019s. A racially fueled violent backlash in New York City and Philadelphia against immigrants, \u201cNativists\u201d feared immigrants were the down fall of America."
"Racism in any walk of life is completely vile and unnecessary. Frustratingly, even in the \u2018beautiful game\u2019, football, no effort has been made to prevent racism from happening. Slogans. Paltry fines. Captains reading out impassive pre-prepared statements over the tannoy. Further paltry fines. Meaningless T-shirts. When nothing significant changes, when words fall on deliberately deaf ears, when punishments are forgotten too easily, when the authorities do not make the effort help, eventually there will come a time for direct action."
"They were smaller in size and shape, and their determination to succeed was in high. Their season was filled with much suffering and SMU was never able to have a winning season until 2008, almost twenty years after the death penalty. It was a loss of hope for the Mustangs after the sufferings they went through, it seemed almost unfair to have to play with a team that was not highly ranked or highly talented. The death penalty was the largest burden to a football team in the history of college football and was never given again."
"They are seen largely making valuable contributions in a child\u2019s development after he/she has achieved control over bodily functions and has reached a certain level of comprehension. However, there are certain ways in which a father or a male can contribute in the upbringing of children that women cannot do complete justice to. Men are generally rational and logic driven and decisions/choices and actions are based on sound reason. The way a father can allow a child to go all out and grow up would not be possible with mothers, who are more protective and would be daunted by the slightest crunch in the heart."
"The aviation industry produces a relatively small amount of the carbon dioxide emissions held responsible for the warming affect on the earth\u2019s atmosphere. However, the aviation industries share in the blame is growing and is causing increasing reasons for concern. Even though airplanes are now over 60% more efficient than they were 30 years ago, recent studies have demonstrated the affect they have on global warming. The carbon emissions from the planes jet engines and the contrails they leave behind are the main concerns environmentalists and politicians have about the industry. (Green Travel 2006)"
"Colonized minority groups such as African Americans are usually forced into minority status. The status is forced upon them by the military and political powers wielded by the majority group. One example is the slave status. Colonized minorities have virtually no chance for assimilation and are typically identified by highly visible physical characteristics."
"One of the most common reasons for referral of children and adolescents to mental health professionals is suspected depression. There are continues debate as to whether childhood and adolescent depression are a reflection of normal variation in mood. It is reasonable for the primary care physician to view childhood depression as a constellation of factors that forms a syndrome. This constellation consists of a persistent mood disorder and dysfunctional behavior that intrudes and distorts the child\u2019s day-to-day activities (Gottlieb & Williams, 1991 p."
"They will show it by never talking badly about you, never judging you for anything, and defending you when you need a shoulder to lean on. Another part about having a friend that respects you is that they will never violate your rights. They will never call you names, or make you feel bad. They will never commit an act of violence against you. They will also never take your things without asking, or damage your possessions. Last, a true friend should be someone loyal. They will never leave you to be with the \u201cpopular kids\u201d, or because they just lose interest in you. They will always be there to catch you if you fall and will put you right back on your feet. Even they get into a fight with you, they will feel bad and immediately make it up with you, because they are loyal."
"Analysis of Fictional Techniques Paper Team C\u2019s Paper is an Analysis of Fictional Techniques on The Child\u2019s Story by Charles Dickens, The Gift of the Magi, by O. Henry, and The Tell-Tale Heart by Edgar Allan Poe. The team focused the following three techniques: 1) Nature of Narration; 2) Nature and level of description included in the story; and 3) Use of Setting. Several questions have been answered concerning the different effects produced by each of the authors\u2019 use of these techniques."
"While walking to school on the first day, Cassie and her brothers are cascaded in red dust as a bus full of white kids skids past, though they eventually get their revenge on the kids by sabotaging the bus. This is significant not only because it shows us just how boorish white kids were to black kids, but it also shows that black kids had to walk to school, and to some black kids, according to Cassie, the walk is so long they are forced to drop out of school. Cassie, being in fourth grade, attends a school especially for black kids. On the first day back to school, she and the other students are staggered to realize that that year they would be having books in the class, something that at that time was a luxury for an all-black school. Though once Cassie sees the books, she quickly sees why the books were given to them. The books were old and dirty, and on the inside of the front cover clenching to stay on was the label \u201cNigras.\u201d Infuriated, Cassie refuses to take the book, and is ultimately whipped for her quarrel."

"This illustrates how Slim has a hidden strength, and almost acts like a noble dark horse. When Curley\u2019s wife dies, the character of Slim reveals that he did care about Curley\u2019s wife which is why he is respectful and caring during her death. This is shown when Slim tells Curley \u201cstay here with your wife.\u201d Slim uses an imperative to show how he knows that Curley needs to stay there for his own benefit but for Lennie\u2019s as well. But, as the situation escalates Slim realizes that \u201cwe gotta get im.\u201d As he takes control of the situation he does not do because he wants to kill Lennie but because he wants them to go easy on Lennie and not hurt him. This is because Curley wants to, \u201cstrap him down and put him in a cage.\u201d This illustrates how Slim cares for Lennie and does not want him to die. When Lennie dies he has to act as a confidant where he goes to George and not the opposite way round because he has to reassure him because otherwise he knows that George will be feeling very bad after. He uses his realistic look on life to show how in life that is a harsh life, this is shown when he says, \u201cA guy got to sometimes.\u201d"
"No matter what my mom has to do in any given day, she always makes sure that she is my biggest supporter at every school event, social event, or soccer game, She is always on the sidelines cheering me on at all of my soccer games She goes to all the parent teacher conferences and knows where I stand halfway through the quarter. She is always supporting me to do my best and excel in schoolt She serves on so many committees at Jesuit such as the mailings, the bazaar committee, and the gala committee, Most importantly, she is loving Everything she does towards me is out of an act of love."
"\u201cI cannot think of any need in childhood as strong as the need for a father\u2019s protection. \u201d \u2013Sigmund Freud, Standard Edition, 1956 Growing up without a father or strong male role model in the United States is extremely difficult. Fatherless children are disadvantaged in American society and face a greater struggle to become successful in their personal, educational, and professional lives. The decline of fatherhood in one of the most unexpected and extraordinary trends of our time."
"His childhood was characterized by constant fear mostly emanating from the family. His father was abusive, constantly yelling at them and punishing them minor offenses. He recalls an instance on his twelfth birthday when he went out to play with the other children in the neighborhood and in the process got hurt. He returned home bleeding and found his dad watching the latest news about the Cuban crisis in the living room."
"Everyone knew that the case was deliberately doomed. However, Atticus continues to fight. The boundless sense of duty, honor and an acute sense of justice, make the lawyer take up this matter. He is an honest lawyer and a true gentleman. His life positions cause respect. He not only skillfully defended Robinson but also became one of the symbols of people-fighters against racism. Despite all the efforts of the lawyer, Robinson was convicted. Harper Lee describes the topic of relationship to another person in comparison with a birdie mockingbird. Atticus compared Tom\u2019s death with the senseless killing of songbirds."
"Co-parenting conflict was high between them and visits arrangement to my mother was not an option to my dad. This separation was confusing and stressful for my older siblings ( two brothers). Watching my both parents apart and fighting over us affected my siblings well-being. A year later this separation started affecting me negatively. I became more isolated and had fears of being alone in any public place. I started having social, emotional and academic problems as well as my siblings had the same issues. These three years of separation had a significant risk on everyone in my family including my parents. My parents reconciled after three years of separation. I felt this separation was not the end, it was a new beginning. Both learned their lessons and both learned how to cope with their future conflicts."

"I was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity of a second chance with my life with the help and guidence of Teen Court. I was forced to learn about my mistake and its effects. I had not thought of shoplifting as having an effect on the economy or community as I have learned. Every day prices on things that we need continue to go up and up. Things like bread and tea become more expensive for reasons I did not know and make it harder for families to afford what they need to survive. Above inflation, over-priced items and product quality there is one other reason this is happening. That reason is shoplifting. It is a completely unfair and unjust reason for prices to go up but its reality."
"Their coming became the buzz of the whole place and they held a ball as a celebration. The Bennets attended the ball and Mr. Bingley was immediately attracted to Jane, the eldest and prettiest among the Bennet sisters. The two danced throughout the occasion and hit it off. A romance between Mr. Bingley and Jane started to blossom. Mr. Darcy, however, was repelled by Elizabeth\u2019s (the second eldest Bennet child) firm character. As the days passed, Mr. Darcy is soon pulled towards Elizabeth\u2019s wit and intelligence. But then, Mr. Darcy is disgusted with Mrs. Bennet\u2019s unlovable attitudes and convinced his friend, Mr."
"Tom then had a vision or dream that very night (Chimney Sweeper, 1789, line 9-10) about chimney sweepers Dick, Ned and Jack being dead and their bodies in black coffins (these \u201cblack coffins\u201d can be compared to the soot they slept in). The reason the speaker used the names Dick, Ned and Jack is because majority of boys in that era had names similar to these, this goes to show that many boys were chimney sweepers."
"At first I felt like Lennie was a burden on George and was just a guy Lennie\u2019s Aunt Clara dumped upon George. But as the story Progressed the relationship and the interaction became deeper and almost felt as if they were family. In conclusion the book really showed me about truly unique friendships. George and Lennie are models for me. It showed me\u00a0that any interactions can lead to a deep, serious friendship. Also that even though George and Lennie seem like two different people they can still become closer than brothers."
"He gave her everything she wanted, including a big house, money, jewelry, and whatever else she asked for. In Nigeria, it is expected that the rich remain in power. The General lived up to this expectation by making Uju ask him for everything she needed. This put her in a submissive position and gave the General control over her. When Ifemelu confronted her Aunt Uju about her situation, Uju insisted that she was going to \u2018change\u2019 her lover. Even though Uju made some progress, overall this relationship only contributed to Nigeria\u2019s perceptions about relationships. Powerful and rich men get what they want, when they want it. They are often seen as superiors due to their wealth. This could be seen when The General was supposed to spend the holiday with Uju (instead of his wife) but he cancelled last minute. Instead of being mad at The General, she turns her frustrations toward Ifemelu who spoke up against him; Aunty Uju charged at her \u2018the slap landed on the side of her face\u2019 (Adichie 98.) Uju acted powerless in this situation, and Ifemelu recognized it. Aunty Uju simply acted as a servant to The General. Ifemelu attempted to have a real conversation with her Aunt, but she was in denial. Nigerian society had persuaded Uju that there was little she could do \u2013 and she believed it."
"Also,due to science there is aesthetic surgery which is innovative. Some housewives think that they are not enough pretty and rely on aesthetic surgery to enhance their appearance. Aesthetic surgery is now very common in countries such as the United Kingdom,France and Germany. In Asia,cosmetic surgery has become an accepted practice and China is the Asia\u2019s biggest cosmetic surgery market and there are also liposuction the removal of fat deposits by traditional suction technique."
"The bird\u2019s song is joy on the other hand human\u2019s songs are sadness. Finally, the speaker wishes to be able to sing as freely and happily as the bird. This essay will critically examine three different connections the poet brings out and message to others. sadness,\u00a0 happiness and man and the natural world."
"With the butchery of the Ibos in Northern Nigerian in 1966 and commencement of the Nigerian troubles, he resigned from distribution Corporation and moved back eastern Nigeria. There, when the region declared itself independent under the name of Biafra, he threw in his lot with his fellow \u2013 Ibos during the civil war. Even during the war he concentrated on rebuilding the University of Nigeria, Nssuka, where he now teaches."
"A very good morning to my beloved teacher, Pn. Fatirah Aziz and all my fellow friends. As you know, my name is Nurin Fatihah and I\u2019m pleased to talk with you about a topic that is near and dear to you, \u201cFriends and Friendship\u201d. In life, everyone will meet many people that say that they are your friend. But you will make only a few true friends. What is a friend ?"
"A negative of this type of observation is due to confidentiality other children can\u2019t be involved in the observations. Whilst observing a child another child might run out in front of the camera or a member of staff might say another child\u2019s name so therefore the observation can not be used. Another negative of this observation is the huddle might go flat so the practitioners won\u2019t be able to take an observation. The last negative of this observation is there might not be a huddle for every staff member, so this requires the sharing and missing an important observation."
"Towards the end of the book, Lennie accidentally kills the puppy which was given to him, by stroking it too hard. Initially he reacts to this by getting upset and crying \u2018why do you got to get killed?\u2019 this highlights his lack of knowledge and understanding with the concept of death, the reader feels sympathy towards the sorry state he is. However, Lennie then begins to get frustrated and angry about it and hurls the puppy away, he worries that by what he has done George will not let him \u2018tend the rabbits\u2019. At this point the sympathy towards Lennie stops, as this part shows his aggressive and selfish side as he is worrying for himself."
"Angelle Hobbs Joanna is a 16-year-old eleventh grader, the oldest of four children. Her best friend had died suddenly of leukemia the previous year. Presently, Joanna\u2019s grades have begun to drop and she cuts class. She feels she should have done more to help her best friend. Joanna\u2019s mother has been contacted for a parent conference, but she works two jobs to financially support her children. Joanna\u2019s homeroom teacher is very concern and refers her to the school counselor."
"In a few minutes the sun will be peeking through the trees and the crystal ice will melt away. I sit here, drinking in the sights, sounds, and smells of early morning in the wooded hills where I live. It is a peaceful feeling knowing that I need not hurry for anything this morning. I reflect on the fact that I am a lucky woman."
"Advances in technology over the past decades means that doctors are now able to create life where there was none before. Other medical technologies mean that people who would once have died are now kept alive. What are the suggestions of this for the idea of God being the sole creator or giver and take or life?"
"There is another incident in the novel that shows how inferior and weak Crooks is portrayed. After Curley\u2019s wife enters the room to talk to him, Lennie and Candy, Crook\u2019s ends up getting frustrated with Curley\u2019s wife and starts telling her off. However, by now the readers would have thought that Crook\u2019s is finally standing up for himself and defending himself, but this all changes in the space of a few minutes. For example, Curley\u2019s wife retaliates and say\u2019s \u2018Listen, Nigger, you know what I can do to you if you open your trap?\u2019 \u2018Well, keep your place Nigger. I could get you strung up on a tree so easily it ain\u2019t even funny\u2019."
"The purpose/aim of \u2018Deadly Unna?\u2019 is to highlight the seriousness of racism that takes place in the country we live in, as well as focusing on many concerns that adolescences face today. This is very effective as the book is intended for young adults meaning they are able to relate and compare their\u00a0lives to the ones created in the book."
"In fact, lending a little amount of money to women can be \u00a0the \u00a0start \u00a0of \u00a0their \u00a0business \u00a0to \u00a0provide \u00a0their \u00a0own \u00a0necessities. For example \u00a0Saima Mohammad who was about to be divorced by her husband because of having only a daughter and no son. Her husband had borrowed 3,000$, and he was not able to pay it back. So, Saima went to Pakistani micro finance organization called Kashf Foundation, took out only 65$ as loan and bought her 65$ bead and clothes to make embroidery from them and sell them to market in Lahor."
"Trefry indeed seems to try to retain the horizontal com-ponent, as he \u201cloe\u2019d him (Oroonoko] as his dearest Brother, and shew\u2019d him all the Civilities due to so great a Man\u201d (35). But Trefry\u2019s ineffectiveness marks an extra level of danger associated with the com-mercial order: not only does it corrupt master and slave alike, but it is hegemonic enough to disempower even the well-intentioned individ-uals who emerge within the system. Thus, the commercial order, in as-signing Oroonoko to the vertical rank of slave without regard to blood quality, fails to assign his identity in a culturally intelligible way. Oroonoko becomes the signifier of the commercial order\u2019s failure to render slavery culturally intelligible.\u201d And the tragic trajectory of the story follows from this failure. Oroonoko doesn\u2019t \u201cfit\u201d the system; he is a kind of floating semiotic disturbance within the system, and also evi-dence that a fault line in a culture\u2019s conceptual space can have serious material consequences."
"Often times we perceive All Lives Matter as being associated with criticism of the Black Lives Matter movement. Although most times their judgment is based upon assumptions, false accusations and mostly misunderstandings. In the book I Don\u2019t See Color: Personal and Critical Perspectives on White Privilege, Bettina Bergo and Tracey Nicholls discuss an interview between Bill O\u2019Reilly and President Obama. During this interview, O\u2019Reilly asks Obama how it makes him feel that so many people hate him (122). Obama replied, \u201cThe truth is that the people, and I\u2019m sure previous presidents would say the same thing, whether it was Bush, or Clinton, or Reagan, or anybody, the people who dislike you don\u2019t know you\u201d (qtd."
"Poe also limits the setting so that the only two people who exist throughout most of the story are the narrator and the old man; further allowing readers to identify with the narrator. Each of these factors was equally important to the success of the story. If any one of these factors were changed, the story would have suffered and would have been altered into something unrecognizable. For example, if Poe had chosen to tell his story from a different perspective, he would not have been able to infuse the story with the sense of mad urgency that currently drives it. The Child\u2019s Story"
"\u201cMore than 10 million illegal immigrants live in the United States, and 1,400 more arrive everyday\u2026 they are rapidly moving into non-traditional areas\u2026Willing to work for low wages, the migrants are creating a backlash among some residents of the new states\u201d (Katel 1). These people will work for next to nothing to make sure they at least have a job a day be it landscaping or pretty much anything. Immigrants are willing to do the impossible to keep going."
"Lastly, we live in a world with a corrupt criminal justice system that punishes many blacks innocent minorities. In society, 97% of federal cases and 94% of state cases are plea bargains with defendants pleading guilty for a guaranteed lesser sentence. Many of the defendants who are minorities or black and have little to no resources take up a plea bargain from their (oftentimes) public defender. Pleading guilty violates the 6th amendment which states that I have a right to a trial by jury. Racism isn\u2019t just a key component to the criminal justice system but it is the heart of history within the culture of countries, and states."
"4. How and why does the shape change? How does an increase or decrease in the average childbearing age group change the population? Why do \u201cfirst world\u201d countries tend to have older childbearing women than \u201cthird world\u201d countries? The shapes of the graphs were getting closer to the projected value as childbearing age increased. In contrast, when the childbearing age decreased the population growth was much steeper than the projected values. The childbearing age increased and the population growth rate decreased due women giving birth at an older age. First world countries tend offer women either higher education or the opportunity to work, thus increasing the age at which women give birth."
"Even with little similarities between peers, it can go a long way in adolescent development (West 2014). The perceived similarities between peers can be most beneficial in strengthening bonds and help build a sense of where an individual stand. Self-other comparison is determined by adolescents when their own personal and social worth base on how they fare against another peer. Adolescents compare themselves as a way of self-improvement and motivation (West 2014). This helps contribute in developing their self-image and this is a lifelong occurrence."
"I felt so devastated, why couldn\u2019t God believe me? Why is my mom not coming back to me? I was confused about being only 8 with no support system; I had no way of knowing this was permanent. Who loved me now?, how would anyone protect me against the angry, alcohol-induced father I knew. I had not long to realize, my grandmother was going to take me in and give me a kind of normal life. Grandmother was strict, loud, but she could be loving and kind. I truly believe even for the three short years, before she died with cancer and left me, she changed my life and molded me into the person I am today."
"The arguments that will be mentioned throughout might go against the popular view that brain drain is a dreadful phenomenon. One of the claims might be that all of the \u201cgood brains\u201d could migrate and leave their countries instead of staying and working for and in their country, to help it improve economically and socially better than just leaving and sending money back through remittances. The reply to that would be: what if there is a very high unemployment rate where this person can\u2019t find a job or he can find a job but he isn\u2019t appreciated for his skills, ideas, and innovation, then his only option would be to travel somewhere else where he has better opportunities to improve his talents. Another point would be the assumption of developing countries remaining developing nations forever; they won\u2019t be able to use those good brains in inventing and innovating new things."
"Most people must make financial decisions in which many cannot afford housing (Christian). People are unaware of financial issues people around them go through, leaving them uninformed of the issue. More welfare could be funded if governments took action to help end homelessness, but many are still not informed of the problem."
"Sophie\u2019s thoughts raced about how her and Ronan had been trying to have a baby for too long. Far too long. Over the course of their marriage, the couple had received three rejections to date. After the first rejection, Ronan and Sophie tried to believe that outside factors contributed to the outcome of the test to keep their spirits high. They convinced themselves that it was a fluke. After the second rejection, Ronan and Sophie sold their house and moved to a rural town on the outskirts of the city. The gated community they now lived in was lined with cookie cutter row houses. The neighbourhood had open field space with play structures for children. It was virtually crime free and very peaceful- the ideal neighbourhood to start a family. After their third rejection, Ronan and Sophie changed careers, and started reading and writing daily. They cut caffeine and alcohol out of their lives completely and started eating cleaner. Sophie picked up on yoga and pottery while Ronan joined a biking group. They knew that at this point that it was not a fluke. This was their fourth try- their last try to have a child. Sophie relayed Dr. Foster saying that receiving a rejection was not a reflection on the parents but she couldn\u2019t help but think about what it was a reflection on then."
"\u201cThe abuser doesn\u2019t play fair, he or she uses fear, guilt, and intimidation to wear you down and gain power over you\u201d (Turley 117). Turley references the different things done by the victim turned abuser in their relationship through his own experience. He was the reason his relationship with his child\u2019s mother was not successful. The first sign he was turning into an abuser was exhibiting the actions of a dominant partner, wanting to have total control (Merriam-Webster)."
"While the threat of a world war has diminished, the violence on the streets across America has increased at a dramatic rate. Police are forced to face this violence and are sometimes caught up in the same violent and abusive cycle whole trying to fight it. Citizens realize that there are limits as to what a police officer can do. To make society a safe place for both citizens and officers, it is imperative that they work together for a comprehensive checks and balances system."
"There are three major categories of risks that children are exposed to while in online environments. These are content, conduct and contact. Content risks are those that face children upon exposure to inappropriate and unwelcoming content. This content may take the form of violent images, pornographic material, sexual materials, racist advertising, discriminatory advertising, and hate-speech. It may also involve websites that advocate for dangerous and unhealthy habits such as anorexia, self-harm and suicide. On the other hand, conduct risks refers to situations where children act in a manner that contributes to dangerous contact or content. This may take the form of creating or writing hateful material, posting or distributing sexual content and inciting racism or discrimination. Finally, contact risks are those that face children when they are involved in dangerous communication. For instance, a child may be involved in communication with an adult who seeks to solicit sexual favors or inappropriate contact. This may also take the form of radicalizing or persuading children to take part in dangerous or unhealthy behaviors."
"These \u201ctwo books tell very different stories: Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin presents slavery as an evil to be opposed, while Gone With the Wind suggest that slavery was an ideal social structure whose passing is to be lamented\u201d [ (Loewen, 1995) ]. Our history textbook discusses slavery in way that describes what drove the slavery industry, such as the development of the cotton gin and how it helped the rise of the slavery industry. In 1790 the production numbers and slave numbers were considerably lower than they were seventy years later. The slave population quadrupled while cotton production increased more than 1,500 percent [ (Gary B. Nash, 2009) ]. Our book coincides with what James Loewen says about books avoiding owners and by discreetly discussing what really happened to the slaves. While our book does go into more depth than other history books that I have had in the past, it does try to cover up some things that would be of major interest to those who want to know the truth of what slavery was really like back in the 19th century without all of the cover-ups and trying to protect the image of the founding fathers and to still keep white Americans on top. In Connecticut in the 1950s, when I was growing up, the only slavery discussed in my history textbook was southern; New Englanders had marched south to end slavery. It was in Rhode Island, where I lived after 1964, that I first stumbled across an obscure reference to local slavery, but almost no one I asked knew anything about it. Members of the historical society did, but they assured me that slavery in Rhode Island had been brief and benign, involving only the best families, who behaved with genteel kindness."
"The title \u2018No witchcraft for sale\u2019 was used because the black witchcraft was something that Gideon possessed that the white man did not, this is very similar to \u2018Six feet of the country\u2019 as the six feet represent the land that Petrus\u2019s brother was buried in, it would be all that he owned that couldn\u2019t be taken from him."
"For example when her mother tells her a fairy story to explain how the trout got in to the well she simply dismisses the story \u201cPooh\u2026 \u201c. I think that she dismisses the story because fairy tales are seen as childish and she wants to seem mature. Another example of symbolism that shows that Julia wants to grow up is when she mocks and teases her brother after they have run through \u2018The Dark Walk\u2019. I think that she mocks her brother because she wants to make herself appear to be more grown-up and braver than him \u201cCry babby!"
"Parents care about the behavior and the way their children express, when I was little I always got nervous when I had to perform a presentation, but when my mummy helped me I became a little bit more relaxed because she even showed me how to move, and that is something that a teacher could never do. Parents even take care of how their children are felling."
"This character trait shows her insecurity and indecisiveness, which affects her actions later on in the proceeding letters. The letters are written by both Mary, in letters one and two, and Georgiana in letters three and four. Both character\u2019s letters convey a different style and attitude in how they are written. Mary\u2019s first letter is fast paced and written in a stream of consciousness. This shows Mary\u2019s excitability and childish attitude. The emphasis on the childishness of Mary may be Austen trying to attack the age of marriage in the nineteenth century, and how it was rushed. Mary is only seems young minded in the story. The second letter is far more organised, and now contains dialogue."
"An extremist Muslim party and the Communist party are outlawed. The country is divided into 24 provinces, two special districts, and a metropolitan district, Jakarta, each with an appointed governor. The central government has 37 ministries, headed by military officers. Indonesia regards itself as one of the so-called unaligned nations. It helped organize and served as host for the Bandung Conference of 1955, which helped give identity to the concept of a Third World in international affairs."
"Adult violence against children remains a norm in our society. (Hooks 73) Chapter 14-Liberating Marriage and Partnership \u201cFeminism is for Everybody\u201d Thesis: Sexist unions are those situations where men own, control, and treat women as property and women become trapped in a marriage that is little more than sexual slavery; this unfair standard found in monogamous marriage impelled women to become autonomous in marriage. I. Sexist unions where men own, control, treat women as property are abhorrent."
"By using \u201cNew World treats\u201d, this may suggest the aging time in his Dad life, as we are provided with the idea that his father has Diabetes \u201cAh\u2019m diabetic now. Got all the facts\u201d. Although this could be suggested, at the end of this stanza we are told by the narrator that these were bought as a \u2018last thought\u2019: \u201conly bought rushing through JFK as a last thought\u201d which could highlight the disconnection of the two male personas."
"Every time I set down near my grand mother, speak to her and listen from her, I question the variety of popular or standard proverbs that she utilizes while talking about any topic. I always try to ask her to provide me \u201csubstantial\u201d explanations about the significances that I can\u2019t see behind those words. And of course she always assists me and surprises me with deep cultural conventional explanations for the proverbs she uses. Utilizing sayings is extremely typical here in Morocco."
"President Obama enforced that law enforcement must wear body cameras while on duty to record all events that occur (). Obama took to the press to stress the importance of Black Lives Matter and seeking justice for those wronged by the ones sworn to protect them (1). Having the support of the president allowed for the black community to further make stepping stones to the path of their civil freedom. The president never hesitated to discuss the issue whenever he made a national address to the nation. Obama used his power of authority for the better, to make a change and address the issue of the black community receiving full civil rights in America. Bernie Sanders, another political activist, has been a substantial help in the fight for African American civil rights since the civil rights era. Sanders build and run his campaign on the importance of equality and the fair treatment of all Americans (Broadwater, 2). Sanders have several platforms that if elected president would aid the efforts of the civil rights movement. Sanders speak of ending over policing in African American communities as well as demilitarizing the police force (). His strategies prove to be in the best interest of the black community and protecting their rights as an American. Sanders see the issue at hand and want to make a difference, giving the African American community a voice to fight for."
"In the \u201cMerchant\u201d it could be argued that the friendship between Bassanio and Antonio was not platonic in nature and the friendship between Joseph and Tom, with Tom being at least 30 years his senior, was also not platonic on Tom\u2019s part. But it is the authors purpose and intended audience that are key to understand their portrayal of a noble friendship. Shakespeare was writing for an audience that expected noble friendships, whereas Bauer was aware of society\u2019s perception and manipulated that through Mrs Mossop who is the \u201cenemy\u201d of the novel."
"Juliet\u2019s mother tells her that her father has arranged for her to be married to Paris; she says he is \u201ccareful\u201d; Capulet accepting Paris\u2019 offer, despite his previous comments (\u201cand too soon married\u201d) shows how he is concerned and compassionate for Juliet. They believe that planning her marriage will make her happy and take her mind off Tybalt so in this sense they are being good parents by doing what they believe would make her happy."
"Information, data, and numbers concerning maternal mortality are derived from the hospital\u2019s records and reported cases in medical centers about people who seek medical care and treatment, as well as community records derived from studies, surveys, and collected data by the community members which is considered as a poor and limited source of information, because it relies on individual cases reporting which is not considered as a reliable source for documentation and research, in addition to the fact that this kind of limited range studies don\u2019t reflect the existing real situation. According to all this, the information related to maternal mortality is not sufficient or enough to have a full image of this topic, this lack of data makes it hard to understand what takes place in real life, especially in abandoned far areas with poor and limited medical care access and facilities, as well as the wide range of the unreported and unsafe home- deliveries and abortions and complications. As well as the lack of data concerning these women\u2019s diagnosis, background, and medical history."
"Peter is hitchhiking on the road when Tom stops and picks him up. They start an awkward conversation, and Tom becomes suspicious of Peter. When Tom thinks Peter is about to pull a gun, he preemptively pulls his own gun and shoots Peter. His mother is devastated, and tells Graham that he responsible, because he didn\u2019t help his brother."
"The 1987 government policy paper on the defence of Australia stated, \u201cno population increase is necessary for defence\u201d. Today\u2019s defence needs require a strong economy and sophisticated, expensive military infrastructure. We need a professional well trained mobile technically advanced force with access to sophisticated weapon systems. A cohesive and united society, not a divided multicultural society, is what is needed for our defence."
"The 70-80-onwards lived in the world with no internet, mobile phones, or other contemporary gadgets. It is difficult to them to understand the whole spectrum of benefits which technologies give people. The elderly perceive it as something hostile. Simultaneously, the younger generation cannot imagine communication without the Internet. The lack of understanding of both points of view leads to conflicts. Children don\u2019t communicate enough with their grandparents simply because the youngsters don\u2019t want to visit their relatives, while the latter don\u2019t want to learn how to use the Internet to talk online."
"Everyone eventually begins to gradually break down and losing their family love and are always getting on at each other. Eventually the divorce is decided on and mom moves out. Hal decides to be one of the kids who goes with the mom. Emily and Dee don\u2019t want him to go. Hal moves out of his old room and misses it."
"Malaria kills 3,000 African children per day. (Anon 2018.3) Deaths that could have been prevented with proper medical attention and resources. They don\u2019t have the resources or the education necessary for this though. Something as simple as clean water could save even more. There are so many things that we take for granted every day. Bathrooms, showers, doctors, hospitals, emergency rooms, even Band-Aids. Many things that we don\u2019t see at that important would prove to be invaluable over there."
"Other characters are Mrs. Franklin, Alma\u2019s mother, who works as a housekeeper of the Rossman\u2019s. Who believes in spanking a child if have done something wrong. Then, Susan, a pale blonde girl, first approached and played with Alma on the first day of school.

Then Donald who first hurt Alma when she wants to play with blocks but the tower fell down when the black girl puts one at the very top. He pushed her away and bumped her head on the edge of the door."
"At first I didn\u2019t know many people there and wasn\u2019t very enthusiastic. Later, as I got to know the other kids and starting pushing myself to join in the activities, I learned to enjoy and relish my time there. Some activities we did was decorating the nursing home for Christmas, singing carols, writing letters to the residents, and just sitting there visiting and listening to what they had to share."
"One of many techniques that Amy Chua uses throughout the article is effective content, for instance, statistics and especially examples. In paragraph 4, she provides impressive statistics which are dominant numbers about the thinking of Western and Chinese mothers. \u201c70%\u201d (217) in the number of Western mother who opposed the idea of pressing in academic suddenly dropped down to \u201croughly 0% of the Chinese mothers felt the same way\u201d (217). The gap between the numbers surprises the readers."
"Increase in average temperatures is the major problem caused by global warming. The average global temperature has increased by about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit over the past 100 years. 2016 was the hottest year on record worldwide. Such temperatures turn our environment into a breeding ground for infections and diseases. The worst thing is that increased dryness and greenhouse gases serve as natural fuels for wildfires."

"Southern states believed that this power was reserved for them and by proclaiming the 36\u00b030\u2019 North latitude line, the federal government exercised unconstitutional power. The Dred Scott decision further supported the clause that the issue of slavery was reserved for the state government. Despite this, the South realized that the North and its anti-slavery views were gaining ground, while the North believed that the Dred Scott ruling limited its power."
"Target CEO Brian Cornell even specifically noted that the Hispanic shopper is \u201cshopping much less\u201d, \u201cgoing out less often\u201d, and \u201cstaying home\u201d (Townsend & Soper, 2017). Dallas Fed Chief Robert Kaplan echoed these statements as well (Davidson, 2017). A direct quote from a Reuters article from Richa Naidu (Naidu, 2017) states:"
"There are those within the community who take a more inclusive position most notably, the late Mrs. Coretta Scott King, and the Reverend Al Sharpton, who, when asked in 2003 whether he supported gay marriage, replied that he might as well have been asked if he supported black marriage or white marriage. Neighborhoods African American neighborhoods are types of ethnic enclaves found in many cities in the United States. The formation of African American neighborhoods is closely linked to the history of segregation in the United States, either through formal laws, or as a product of social norms."
"Analyses of Eighth Amendment demand courts to consider the evolution of decency standards. This is important in ascertaining that a particular punishment constitutes an unusual or cruel punishment. It is required that when considering evolving decency standards, objective factors that show a change in standards of the community must be observed and independent evaluations made concerning the reliability and/or essence of the statute in question. Although the death penalty is being considered effective in deterring capital crimes, the Supreme Court ruling discredited capital punishment for juvenile offenders. Majority opinion indicated that juveniles are irresponsible and immature. They have incomplete character development and are greatly vulnerable to negative influences. The Supreme Court deduced that adolescent offenders assume reduced accountability for their crimes. However, social science researchers point out that people do commit murder widely in the heat of passion. The reason for this may be influence from drug or alcohol, mental illness."
"Parents should realize this and try to escape from such a multi-vector pressure. How interesting is the mother\u2019s life, if she believes that the child has no right to get a bad evaluation? How can this be avoided, but remain firm and consistent without destroying the child\u2019s personality? First of all, it is necessary to distinguish the pressing behavior from the demanding. And for this, parents need to understand what they feel when they communicate with the child. Irritation, anger, annoyance or resentment causes an instant (protective) reaction \u2013 that is, parents press on the child, seeking from him the unquestioning fulfillment of rules and prohibitions. Persistency arises with a clear understanding of priorities. And then the main thing for it is not evaluation, but curiosity and activity of the child. Being demanding means constantly encouraging him to move forward, considering both strengths and weaknesses of the character. It also means to observe kids\u2019 development, support and protect him when he needs it, and rejoice with him when he acquires new knowledge and skills."
"The author presents both sides of the Triangle fire: the worker\u2019s point of view and the owner\u2019s point of view. Von Drehle allows his audience to decide whether or not the outcome of the disastrous fire was for the good of all. In his view, the Triangle fire sparked a boost to progressives during the early twentieth century. The outcome of the disastrous event is described in the beginning of the book. Family members desperately try in vain to identify their loved ones. The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire will be known as the worst industry disaster until September 11, 2001."
"This paper will answer the research question, what is the relationship between racism and bullying and the education of Hispanic young adults between the ages of 15 and 19. Racism, according to Schmid, (2008) is defined as the lack of equality based on a person\u2019s race only. Bullying is repeated unwanted acts over a minimum of 6 months. As reported by Fry, (2002), only about 10% of Hispanic high school graduates enroll in a four- year college immediately after graduating high school. In a study conducted by Peskin, Tortolero, Markham, Addy & Baumler, (2007) 1 out of 10 Hispanic teens will endure some form of bullying during their high school career."
"Of course, it would be strengthened. If the pistols were useless in matters of self-defense, their release would have stopped long ago. In this case, do not assume that any person due to the presence of his weapon will turn into invulnerable. Some opponents of anti-gun control are confident that only professionals will be able to use it. This is also incorrect. To some extent, all its owners will be able to take advantage of guns, and exhausting themselves by training will significantly increase the chances of success."
"A reader cannot help but root for a character who has redeemable qualities despite whatever odd, crude, or socially unacceptable behavior they may exhibit. Such is the case in my final favorite piece of writing from this semester, Sherman Alexie\u2019s What You Pawn I Will Redeem. In this tale of a homeless, alcoholic, money floundering Spokane, Washington Native American Indian named Jackson Jackson, a reader cannot help but fall in love with his spirit of never-ending generosity and unbreakable ties with tradition and family. Alexie\u2019s particular style of writing gave light to Jackson\u2019s seemingly uncaring, lazy, and unapologetically unmotivated he attitude in a way that a reader cannot help but find just a little bit comical. It is written in first person from the rambling mind of Jackson and lines such as \u201cPiece by piece, I disappeared. And I\u2019ve been disappearing ever since. But I\u2019m not going to tell you any more about my brain or my soul\u201d (citation here page 401) made me laugh out lou01d at the standoffish behavior of this character. Jackson was unable to maintain a job, any of his marriages, or his relationships with his children. In fact, the only thing he did seem capable of maintaining was a constant drunken stupor throughout the entire tale."
"So the cakes are delicious but that is not all, she always decorates them very beautifully, she make these delicious chocolate flowers and place them all over the surface of the cake and many other tasty ingredients. She learned some techniques on that course I guess, but I really think she is very good at it. I always say to her she should dedicate to bake when she get older. She could put a cake store and I am pretty sure she would be very successful. The only defect I can found to her is her boyfriend. They have been dating for approximately two years but they have a really bad relationship."
"The purpose of this article is to discuss the benefits of aquatic therapy as an intervention for older adults with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degeneration a joint cartilage that is under the bone which causes bone on bone contact with inflammation and pain. When your body is in the water you weigh much less causing the participant to have less strain on their bones. One method included a 5 to 10 -minute warm-up session, followed by 30-40 minutes of the designated exercises and then a 5-10 -minute cool-down period. (Davis, J., & Nelson, R. 2015). The patients stated that their motor functioning had been improved, enhanced self-esteem and reduced depression. This intervention has increased patient\u2019s mobility as well as increased their range of motion. This intervention has seemed to be very successful for this population (Davis, J., & Nelson, R. 2015)."

There is not Caribbean accent in this poem. This is showing that he has living in England for so long that he has forgot his mother tough. The language is connected to the grammar of the poem. Reading through the poem there are no full stops or comers etc. The expression of the poem isn\u2019t direct as \u2018Old Father\u2019. It is directly and clearly written and said. There aren\u2019t any different kinds of spellings or grammatical rules in this poem."
"As part of their sustainable aviation strategy, Virgin Atlantic will be introducing a scheme where their passengers can take more responsibility for their carbon emissions and offer them the choice of offsetting their flights. On an individual level it would work on the principal of making a donation to a sustainable development scheme, for example a forestry project, to offset the carbon emissions the journey has created. Due to the recent raised awareness of environmental problems caused by aviation, there has been an increase in the amount of travellers wishing to offset their flight (CarbonNeutral 2007). However it has still only generated a small amount of carbon neutral flights when compared to the ever growing demand for air travel."
"Marriott also offers a work environment that encourages personal and professional growth, and associates are rewarded for and have access to services that support their well-being, which allows their associates to form the foundation of environmental and social partnerships (Marriott International, 2009). Internal service quality, defined as employee satisfaction with the service received from internal service providers has proves that while internal marketing job satisfaction may not lead to customer satisfaction directly, organizations rarely have satisfied customers without having satisfied employees ()."
"Finally, the religious beliefs of the Nayars show an extraordinary mixture of Hindu and Dravidian cults. According to Panikkar, all the temples are dedicated to Krishna Siva or Kartyayani (Panikkar, 1918). There are also a few kavus or groves for the worship of the lesser Hindu deities. Nevertheless, the important point with regard to this is that the Nayars are as whole people almost without a religion and they use the Hindu temple for practices, which receive no sanction even in the generous vagueness of that creed. The religious conceptions of Hinduism have but the slightest influence on the Nayar community as a whole."
"Ms. Mao states that many people describe members of the Han nationality as having thin black hair, black eyes and yellow skin. She stated that Chinese people usually do not discuss cultural issues because unless you travel to the out most reaches of the country, there is only one culture, the Han. The most negative aspect of being Chinese for Ms. Mao is the difficulty in getting a passport for travel to the U. S. She believes that this is because of two reasons first a bias against the people of China, secondly the Chinese government\u2019s strict policy to know absolutely everything you do and everywhere you go at all times."
"Elliot Rodger even posted a manifesto that consisted of several youtube videos proudly displaying his hatred of women and the men that were able to form relationships with them. Law enforcement officials had plenty of opportunities to investigate Rodger and arrest him before he could enact his rampage, however, these warning signs went ignored. In fact, law enforcement officials had previously visited Elliot Rodger three weeks before he would start his shooting. When the officers visited Rodger, they were aware that he had posted the videos online, however, they neglected to actually watch them. Had they not been negligent, these officers could have prevented the shooting and saved six innocent peoples lives and prevent fourteen others from getting injured. Furthermore, by establishing a profile that law enforcement officials and even TSA agents are looking out for, criminals and terrorists can take deliberate steps to avoid fitting this profile."
"This is a circumstance which regrettably continues today, with the current presidential administration\u2019s No Child Left Behind initiative imposing further dependence upon the diagnostic testing and grade-evaluation policies which have long been an appendage of established educational patterns. The new education standards are given over to a \u201cfundamentally punitive law that uses flawed standardized tests to label schools as failures and punish them with counterproductive sanctions. \u201d (Neill, 1) This is also a sharp diversion in focus from that which Bruner argues is a priority for the diverse student bodies in our urban schools."
"Between the two parts in the movie, Derek\u2019s fathers conversation at the dinner table expressing prejudice toward a different race and how his father died shows how social learning can come into effect. Children learn from what they hear causing them to be prejudice and to stereotype other people. The neo-nazi group shared beliefs about the characteristics of members of a different racial group. The thinking made them all believe that all they are\u00a0all alike."
"Saline solution is used to flush the IV between each dose. A minute or two after the final dose is administered, a doctor declares the prisoner dead. The body is then sent to the coroner for verification, an autopsy is sometimes performed. Finally, the body is released to family for burial. 2. Electric Chair"
"Culturally, bride price is one of the ways of portraying the appreciativeness to bride\u2019s family, for patiently bringing her up. The mother carries the fetus into her belly for nine months. So, the groom has to appreciate and thank the family (Nkosi 64). The task of raising up someone is a heavy duty. Therefore, an educated and conscious groom has to depict some thankfulness to the bride\u2019s family, for everything. By giving the cattle or goats or even some money to the bride\u2019s family, the groom depicts his capability and warrant the bride\u2019s family that he is competent of caring for their daughter. In fact, through the transference of those items, the groom assures the bride\u2019s family and the preoccupation is less (Ng\u2019ang\u2019a 2). They believe that their daughter is in safe hands."
"Digital Privacy is an aggregate definition that incorporates three sub-related classifications; data protection, correspondence security, and individual security.\u00a0 The term refers to a type of computerized misrepresentation that draws Internet clients to counterfeit sites where they are deceived into uncovering their secret data\u2019s such as passwords and usernames of crucial sites."
"As mentioned above you may be sometimes in a position where you need to reassure others about the fact that information is confidential and you cannot share detail without consent or the parent or other professional. However if there was any risk to a child, young person or adult that would put them at harm then this can be placed on the school to disclose information in supporting the case."
"The recipe we used was from a Swedish cookbook, however, I found a similar recipe online. It was interesting to compare the Swedish cookbook with an American cookbook as well. One difference that was difficult to translate for me was the use of grams insead of cups. There were not many other differences, as the cookbook was written in English. (both recipes are attached below)"
"In western society what is our perspective on happiness? Customarily our aims to achieve happiness are focused on money, success and material possessions. I am sure you have thought, at one time, \u201cIf only I had money, perhaps, won the lottery. I could then buy a better house, faster car and more glamorous clothes\u201d. Britain is richer than ever at present, however, we do not seem to be any happier. Is this possibly because there is no link between complete happiness and money? Some people may believe material possession bring us happiness through a feeling of being accepted."
"\u201cI wasn\u2019t there, so I can\u2019t say (Christ) didn\u2019t (raise the dead),\u201d The Misfit said. \u201cI wisht I had of been there,\u201d he said, hitting the ground with his fist. \u201cIt ain\u2019t right I wasn\u2019t there because if I had of been there I would of known and I wouldn\u2019t be like I am now.\u201d His voice seemed about to crack and the grandmother\u2019s head cleared for an instant\u2026 \u201cWhy you\u2019re one of my babies.

"During her pregnancy her body went through some physical changes. She did not have impulsive cravings and she ate the foods she normally eats but in larger portions. She gained around sixty pounds and now she looks like the way she did before she lost the weight. Her weight when she was a younger child before the teenage years resembles that of her mother. My aunt had an average weight because she was not skinny but she was not overweight either. My cousin\u2019s weight then was average like her mother\u2019s because due to the genes that were passed down to her through her mother."
"Denham blushes, showing that Braithwaite changed his rebellious attitude. Braithwaite\u2019s thought: \u201cSomeday Denham may be a dependable and hard-working man, working in H.M overseas\u201d shows the high expectations he has for Denham, as Braithwaite believes he changed, and he has some inner vivacious qualities, embedded in him. In Weston\u2019s case, the offering of a cigarette shows that they were ready to make amends and to put all the bad events, which took place in the last term, aside and commence a new, fresh beginning."
"Management of FS consists of symptoms control and treating the cause of fever. Parents are often distressed and need to be appropriately informed and guided for the management of their child\u2019s fever by health care professionals. Due to inappropriate use of diagnostic tests and treatments it is extremely important to improve the knowledge of pediatricians and neurologists on FS management and to standardize the diagnostic and therapeutic work-up."
"The solution to America\u2019s gun problem is background checks and restricting gun sales. Removing guns out of their home or passing a prevention gun bill could save lives. Here\u2019s how the solution works. In order to purchase a gun from a federal firearms licensed dealer (FFL), a consumer must provide identification and pass a federal background check using the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2019 4473 form. Fill out the form. The first page of the document requires basic information, including the buyer\u2019s full name, address, sex, birthday, and ethnicity. A social security number is encouraged, but not required. The form also asks the buyer about criminal background, immigration status and mental health information that could result in a consumer being denied. Give the form back to the person who gave you the forms. The person can contact or tell you if you are denied or not."
"In many societies, men have generally held a large portion of the world\u2019s assets. Until generally as of late, ladies in Western societies couldn\u2019t cast a ballot or hold property, making them completely subject to men. Men, unlike to some other group remain with an influence or riches advantage, battled to keep up their command over assets."
"The written article Our Fear oflmmigrants, constructed by Jeremy Adam Smith briefs on the causation of such issues, while providing rational explanations as well. The author claims that the overall fear can directly be linked to our genes and the evolution process as welL Throughout the entire piece, Smith utilizes pathos and logos as rhetoric\u2018s to help prove the given points. As we know, pathos refers to emotions, and logic. The purpose of this article is to help explain and rationalize such fears held in the hearts of the majority, while also showcasing that immigrants are human beings."
"Then, there was a problem. he wasn\u2019t talking as much and his comely appearance changed into a pensive gaze. I often found him in a morose mood and I would share my thoughts and feelings his mind was opaque like a thick wall and it seemed like I was talking to myself. Then breaking the silence I asked him what happened. His face was blank, but he then told me that he was moving to another city far away from here because his parents had gotten a job tranfer."
"The second half assists to show that thou he is in Elysian fields given the absolute freedom, where he could be forever free, where he could find the true love of his life still at that point he chooses to be again the old adding machine. This scene highlights the unconnected issue of free will and no free will. But for sure interestingly suggests that it is the addictive drug for the isolated masse that attempt to lose oneself in the love. This play is referred to as those who temp to understand the condition of humanity in the 21st century."
"This went on to be the first naval battle between the newly equipped ships. With the ships being stronger and more durable than ever, wooden ships did not stand a chance against the ironclads. More importantly, the ships had provided protection to the soldiers on board. Being on board a wooden ship, soldiers had to worry about the ship sinking into the waters. Being aboard an iron clad, allowed soldiers the peace of mind of protection and safety. Iron clads were significantly heavier with the plates of armor, giving soldiers a steady platform to place fire. Bailey goes on to write, \u201cNaval warfare changed forever,\u201d and that it did. In present day, all ships are made out of the strongest steel and iron. Innovation did not stop there for the Naval armies. With iron clads being able to take on endless rounds of ammunition, both navies approached a new strategy. Battle ships began using rams, not an invention of the Civil War, but quite the innovated idea from naval leaders. Bailey discusses in his article how the ram was a powerful weapon used on a mediterranean warships. The ram gave the option for captains to try and sink iron clads by ramming into the body of the ship which led to a solution for sinking the unstoppable ships. The two fighting armies did not stop there to get an upper hand against each other."
"There can be a negative attitude towards going to school for the first time as children may not feel excited or they feel so attached to their Mom or Dad that they don\u2019t want to be left at school. They may even be afraid of the teachers and children and so they may not want to go back again. The fact that they might not want to play with others means they won\u2019t meet new people and with all of this it may be considered as the worst day of their lives."
"Family is one of the most important concept in the culture. Different cultures define family in different ways. Some says that those who have a blood relation with you is your family member, other says that only your wife and kids are included in your family. According to an author \u201cAnthropologists say a culture\u2019s biological and marital kinship rules and patterns of reciprocal obligations define family\u201d9, the definition varies of different cultures. The people from rural background define family in a large sense they include all of their relatives in the family and those from urban background define family in a little narrow sense as compared to the urban background people."
"However, this cannot always be seen as being true, as children over a certain young age are expected to perform tasks and daily duties that Western Culture would deem more suitable for adults. In television adverts, the notion that children are something which should be protected is very common, the Peugeot advert where the image of a young girl in front of a fast moving lorry shows a child very similar to those in Victorian paintings, one that is full of goodness and innocence, one that must be protected; (the Romantic Discourse)."
"Experts say that being isolated can affect your mental health, which evidently it has done to Crooks. He is quiet, aloof (keep yourself to yourself) and depressed. He was not always like this. In his youth he was part of a loving family \u201cremember when I was a little kid on my old mans chicken ranch. Had two brothers, they was always with me, always there\u201d this makes Crooks lonelier than he is now because he had a family, he had a life, he had a future, but now it has been taken from him."
"As present throughout all the texts, the roles of social norms have played as a barrier throughout history having both a physical and mental toll on specific characters in society. Demonstrating resistance to outcomes of social norms reveals the complexion that many of the standards society implants are too narrow and represent more of a rigid constraint; moreover, the narration in the explored texts allude to the idea that explicit social norms can provide proper guidance for action and involvement. Pragmatic reasons for social norms determine how much resistance to outcomes is justified and provide a more universal principle for general acceptance and concerns."
"In \u2018Great Expectations\u2019 when he is having a meal with the Pocket family, he bases almost the whole section of his book on the incompetence of a few adults and the unusual intelligence and diligence of a few children. The family is middle class and they live reasonably well especially in comparison to some others. The mother is the main fixture of incompetence in this book she has no idea how to look after children even though she has quite a few herself. The father wants to help but he does this by giving the children some money to go out and get out of their mothers hair or for their mother to get out of their hair."
"Sir Stephen Harold spender was an English poet, novelist, and essayist who concentrated on themes of social justice and the class struggle in his work, (February 28, 1909, London- July 16 1955). Stephen spender took a keen interest in politics and declared himself to be a socialist and pacifist. This poem is about a boy who longs to be part of a group of children who he looks up to. I think the poet is writing about himself because he uses a lot of words like \u2018my\u2019, \u2018me\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019."
"The author even implemented experiences from his own live during that time. The period plays a very important role in the book and results in the story being even more effective to its readers. (14 \u2013 Gabrielle Southern) Nick Carraway\u2019s backgrounds matches the one of Scott \u2013 native from Minnesota, their parents both send them to study in ivy league schools. In the novel, Nick serves as Fitzgerald\u2019s voice as in his cogitation on time and about the American dream at the end of the book. (14 \u2013 Gabrielle Southern) As well as Nick Carraway, Scott\u2019s life can be mirrored as the one of Jay Gatsby since the two join the military \u2013 the latter participates in World War I and Fitzgerald is part of the United States army. While being at war, both of them fell in love with a girl, in Jay\u2019s case that is Daisy Buchanan, and it Scott\u2019s \u2013 Zelda. By wishing to become rich and successful, Gatsby wanted to impress his beloved one, and Scott aimed to achieve the same, though with Zelda. (13 \u2013 Nick Carraway \u2013 SparkNotes)"
"Second parenting style is known as authoritative parenting. This is a relatively democratic style of parenting as the parents are responsive and receptive towards their children. They are usually willing to respond to the questions of their children. Moreover, they are more encouraging and forgiving parents rather than punishing ones in case the child does not come up to their expectation. Baumrind suggests that these parents \u201cmonitor and communicate clear standards for their children\u2019s conduct. They are forceful, but not aggressive and restrictive. The disciplinary methods adopted by them are supportive. They want their children to be confident as well as socially responsible ( Rosenfeld, 2007). This style ensures healthy development among children because they are taught to abide by rules and regulations in a positive way. They are allowed to asked questions and develop personal opinions. Children of such parents are socially interactive and confident as they have the habit of developing opinions. They are self-assured."

Even if we allow yourself to get to know some of them, this will always be in the back of your mind."
"A hero who made a difference in her fight against racial segregation and discrimination was Rosa Parks. Parks was most known for her fight against bus seats. She was told to get up from her bus seat to allow a white man to sit and she refused. This activated many protests campaigning for her and against. Though the bus boycott of 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama is her most famous moment, it isn\u2019t all that Rosa Parks did to drive the new law towards complete equal rights. Born in Tuskegee, Alabama, on February 4, 1913, Rosa Parks was one of many to be a negro in the wrong place and time. Nevertheless, the fact that she didn\u2019t have many rights didn\u2019t stop her from fighting to get some. She left school at sixteen to care for her dying mother and wouldn\u2019t return for many years to get her diploma. In 1932, Rosa married Raymond Parks, who was an active member in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Being an African American woman in the early twentieth century brought many challenges. She could only drink from a certain water fountain, borrow books from a certain library, and attend certain clubs, schools, etc. Parks was arrested in 1955 due to not giving up her seat to a white man and was later released by bail. This led many other African Americans to do the same. There was a planned boycott on the day of her trial, Monday, December 5. Many were informed of said trial and the planning had been completed. Homes were bombed, including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s. This didn\u2019t stop the boycotters. On November 13, 1956, the Supreme Court ruled that bus segregation was unconstitutional and Parks was named the \u201cmother of the civil rights movement\u201d. In the years following, Rosa Parks wrote an autobiography. In 1999, Parks was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal and after she died at 92 in 2005, she became the first woman in the nation\u2019s history to lie in state at the U.S. Capitol."
"This internal contradiction can be noticed from his romantic affair with Jordan \u2013 Nick likes her gaiety, but he is also repelled by the dishonesty and unreliability towards others. Nick describes the society as a quality of distortion which made him suffer the loss of balance especially when he was drunk in the beginning of the novel. After specific events that happened \u2013 such as Gatsby\u2019s funeral and the millionaire failure in fulfilling his dream, Nick realises that the merriment and joy in the East are faking the reality \u2013 New York and its people are most likely symbolizing the valley of ashes with their moral emptiness and absence of values than a cheerful and truly happy society. This provoked Nick\u2019s redundancy and forced him to return back to West in search for a more quiet place where he will be able to recover and rest. (13 \u2013 Nick Carraway \u2013 SparkNotes)Scott Fitzgerald lived during the 1920s which assisted the most in the creation of the storyline of The Great Gatsby."
"One of the worst crimes known to man is murder. Could there be someone in the world worse than the average killer? In fact, there were two individuals who were far worse than an average killer and their names are Albert Fish and John Wayne Gacy. This paper will be about the lives of Albert Fish and John Wayne Gacy. Now let\u2019s examine Albert Fish life, his crimes, and his punishment. The life of Albert Fish was all but normal to the average man."
"This needs to be explored privately, for example during an appraisal where behaviour can be questioned and required changes can be agreed and recorded with their success being measured. 2) Informal discussions provide opportunity to reflect on the dire effects of discrimination, talking through these issues and imagining how it must feel to experience unfair, unjust treatment, can have powerful effects on thinking and behaviour, hence bringing about change in mind set. 3) Education is a way of challenging discrimination, ensuring that persons abide by work place policies and procedures and codes of practice including those that relate to anti-discrimination policies. Good communication skills enable discrimination to be challenged in an assertive yet encouraging way to bring about behaviour change."
"Honesty in friendship means that the friends will tell the truth about any action taken, being sincere, fair, honorable, and loyal towards the maintenance of their relationship. When friends are honest to each other, one should be able to tell another the negative attributes possessed by him or her and try to make the situation better. Honesty in friendship is also created when there is a bond and trust created between the parties such that there is an unconditional openness created in every individual. Friendship is not based on opportunists."
"1 student in every subject except gym and drama. (Chua) However, Western parents do not emphasize academic achievement and believe that success will not make you happy. (Rosin) According to David Brooks, managing status rivalries, negotiating group dynamics, understanding social norms, navigating the distinction between self and group\u201dthese and other social tests impose cognitive demands that below away any intense tutoring session or a class at Yale. (Brooks) Western parents prefer to involve their children in sports and group activities rather than just sitting in school and burying themselves in study. As a child who grew up under Chinese parenting model, I was asked to do well in school from an early age. I had to get more than A in every subject, otherwise I would not be allowed to participate in school activities. Even after school, when I got home and finished my homework, I couldn\u2019t watch TV for more than an hour. In my childhood, my life was flooded with learning and grades because my parents thought that only those with good grades would succeed.Second, Chinese and Western parents have very different perceptions of how happy children are when they do something good. In Amy Chua\u2019s article, Chinese parents believe that when children are good at doing something, they get praise, admiration and satisfaction, [which] builds confidence and makes the once not-fun activity fun. (Chua) Chinese parents believe that the only way to excellence is through constant practice, so they require their children to do a lot of practice every day to achieve excellence, even though children do not really like it and think it\u2019s difficult to do it. However, Western parents think it is necessary to find their children\u2019s passion and innate talent for something so that they can find happiness themselves. In her article, Hanna Rosin thinks the Chua women rarely express pure love of music; instead they express joy at having mastered it. (Rosin) Western parents believe that it is better for children to discover and practice activities that they are interested in than to force them to practice activities that parents prefer. When I was young, my Chinese parents asked me to practice the piano for two hours every day because they thought playing the piano could cultivate a dignified and elegant temperament, even though they knew I did not like it. My parents believed that if I played the piano well, I would begin to like it. However, when I tried to jitter my fingers and practiced every day, I found it difficult, and I began to be afraid of practicing. Until now, I still hate playing the piano.Next, Chinese and Western parents treat their children\u2019s self-esteem differently. Chinese parents blame, punish and shame their children when their children fail to achieve good marks or disrespect their elders because they believe that children will be strong enough to take the shaming and to improve from it. (Chua) When Amy Chua was extremely disrespectful to her mom, she was called garbage, which made her deeply ashamed but did not damage her self-esteem. However, Western parents thinks there is no reason to believe that calling your child lazy\u2019 or stupid\u2019 or worthless\u2019 is a better way to motivate her to be good than some other more gentle but persistent mode. (Rosin) Western parents are concerned about children\u2019s self-esteem, and they believe that when children fail, it is better to encourage them, guide them, and educate them to do better next time without saying shameful words. I remember once I failed the exam, and I cried sadly. My mother blamed me for my poor grades, \u201cwhy are you so lazy?\u201d After hearing her blame, I doubted whether I had worked hard enough, so I worked harder and harder to get better grades. It did motivate me to study hard, but it hurt my self-esteem undeniably and I cannot forget this failure.Finally, Chinese and Western parents have different views on child-parent obligations. Chinese parents believe that their kids owe them everything (Chua) because parents give birth to their children and they give them life. Therefore, Chinese parents think that children must spend their lives repaying their parents by obeying them and making them proud. (Chua) However, Western parents think that they owe their children because they force the birth of their children. Therefore, parents have a responsibility to provide their children with what they need, while children only need to be responsible for themselves. As typical Chinese parents, my parents think they gave me life, so I should listen to them and do what they want me to do. However, when I came up with my own ideas that didn\u2019t meet my parents\u2019 requirements, we would argue about them. Therefore, in my family, Chinese parents\u2019 concept of child-parent obligations tends to lead to bad child-parent relationships.In conclusion, parenting models in the East and the West are quite different, focusing on success, excellence, child self-esteem and child-parent obligations. Chinese parents need children to be successful and excellent, while Western parents think happiness is the most important. Chinese parents do not concern about children\u2019s self-esteem, but Western parents do, and Chinese and Western parents have opposite views on child-parent obligations. Different parenting models in the East and the West have different effects on children\u2019s growth. In my opinion, the children under the Chinese parenting model are successful, and they make good academic achievements, but the children under the Western parenting model grow up more happily."
"Is it fair? The main subject that is debated upon in this issue is the age of maturity. \u201cChild crime is different from adult crime in that the offenders are, in most legal systems, not deemed to be fully conscious moral individuals\u201d (Debatepedia). Although that is true, children should be moral enough to know that extreme crimes are not right. \u201cMaybe that excuse will work for robbery and such."
"The revolutionary war was a fine example of unity and a great sense of identity. During, the revolutionary era there were many examples of colonial unity as a group and as a soon to be country. The strength of the revolution was dependent on their unity. The colonists had a strong sense identity and unity by the eve of the revolutionary war."
"The success in these Labor Unions lay not only in their arguments themselves, but in the myriad of strikes that occurred. Employers were often hurt financially by so many workers. Many employers simply realized that it would be more economical to make agreements with their workers than to engage in\u00a0warfare. By 1900, the public began to acquiesce the right of workers to organize, bargain collectively, and to strike. Labor Day was made a legal holiday by act of Congress in 1894. However, there were still many disagreements between the employers and Unions and constant battles were going on. Although Labor Unions were not immediately successful during this period, they were a significant stepping stone in that they encouraged the working class to become more vocal in their working circumstances. Labor Unions in this epoch however did achieve some changes, such as better wages, less hours, and a national holiday. These gains were small compared to the precedent the Unions set for America."
"Yes, I believe this makes perfect sense and I honestly never looked at it from that perspective. I do know that the majority of troubled kids are most likely to be punished, sent to jail, or a detention center, but not more so anywhere they can receive some help and guidance. However, these resources are most likely to be available a lot more than better solutions for the problems these kids may have. David Dow\u2019s message was very inspiring and challenging and requires a lot of working together for a positive cause. Because as Dow stated if someone attempted to remove a child from a dangerous environment, where can that child go if the resources aren\u2019t provided? Furthermore, considering these solutions may be challenging for those who find it difficult to see a supposed criminal as being a victim; if they had received the help they needed."
"There is no room for deep conversation, so I just talk about my problem with my best friend\u2019s girl. She gives me some good advice every time I talk to her. Second is the frequency of contact. In male friendships, without having contact with a friend for months or even years, they still consider his friend as a close friend. They do not think that they need to stay in touch to discuss all the things about his live all the time. In contrast, females tend to have regular contact with their close friends all the time. They assume that they have grown apart if they do not stay in touch and no longer in the friendship."
"His father retrieved him and they lived together for awhile, always moving on so that Perry never had a chance to go to school. \u2018I finished the third grade,\u2019 Perry recalled, \u2018which was the finish.\u2019 (Chapter 2)There is also an assumption that Perry killed the Clutters because of what his father told him. Dad snatched a biscuit out of my hand, and said I ate too much, what a selfish, greedy bastard I was, and why didn\u2019t I get out, he don\u2019t want me there no more. He carried on like that till I couldn\u2019t stand it. My hands got hold of his throat."
"\u201cWe are born free \u201cthis aboriginal notion inside each one, is a strong incentive for achieving liberty spiritually and martially. Human being by his innate nature refuses to be controlled by external or even sometimes internal restrictions, always he is in search of a way to break the barriers. Whatever the relations are strong between humans, yet still it is not acceptable to be controlled by others, or controlled by social and conventional barriers."
"In order to slow down population growth \u201cthird world\u201d countries would have to encourage gender equality, thus allowing women to work or get a higher education. This will lead to childbearing at an older age. Also sex education and implementing family planning services with free birth control as those given by \u201cfirst world\u201d would greatly slow population growth. The more effective ways to maintain population near zero is by decreasing the average birth rate and increasing the childbearing age group of women in \u201cthird world\u201d countries. These implementations can be enforced through government policies and programs that encourage women or families to have babies enough to replace their parents. Using the example of Western European countries, the government in \u201cthird world\u201d countries can give monetary incentives for families with less children."
"I like to spend my free time with him becase he always told so loughy stories that he done or will done something in the future but I and all my friends know that it is only sayings . They never will became real. Its more easy to utter words instead of doing something ."
"The supportive material offered for investigation at the end of the book is also very useful for the reader, as it backs up the demonstration that Nash makes. Race and Revolution is, as the title emphasizes, more than a simple historical account. It is an analysis of the concept of \u2018race\u2019 and its importance in American history. Nash chooses the time of the revolution to investigate the concept of race precisely because this seems to have been a turning point in the relationship between the white and the black communities."
"Similar to Lieutenant Barnes, Officer Whitten also adopted this baby who was being physically, emotionally and mentally abused. What such great men that took action when the action was needed. Take a moment and realize that these officers took time out of their personal lives outside of work to make a huge impact in multiple peoples lives. Summarizing that police officers aren\u2019t indeed what the media presume them to be. Not all cops are racist, many of them aren\u2019t just stopping you to harrass you or cause you to have a corrupt day."
"Maria Montessori on the other hand viewed any adult, including the parents, to be a threat to the child\u2019s freedom, as she believed that their presence would hinder the child\u2019s independence. She maintained that within the household, because of the different psychological states between the two, it would be almost impossible for parent and child to live together unless necessary adjustments were made. (Carter, B. B, 1936) According to the philosopher, the child\u2019s home would need to be large with multiple rooms set out like a school environment."
"This assignment has made me realize that high blood pressure plays a crucial part in my family. Knowing that my great grandmother, grandmother, Anne mother has high blood pressure has made me aware of the choices that I need to make in my younger live. Knowing that my mother has high blood pressure get indicate if my sister gets it or carries the jeans or I get sick and carry the team knowing that my mother has high blood pressure can indicate that my sister can get the gene or carry the gene."
"In conclusion, both Wes Moore\u2019s had critical moments and different standpoints throughout the entirety of their lives. At the end of the day, these men were similar and different in many ways. You come across several moments where things truly could have gone either way. They both could have ended up in each other\u2019s shoes. Different things across their paths led them to different places, but their mothers and their own choices for themselves were a huge factor in what happened to them. However, their circumstances are only the half their battles. Though they both had individual accountabilities it was the choices that they individually made that ultimately determined their fates. \u201cWes and I stared at each other for a moment, surrounded by the evidence that some kids were forced to become adults prematurely.\u201d"
"Meanwhile, many other soluble blood markers for FIRS, mainly proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF ), have been introduced and histological funisitis/chorionic vasculitis has been suggested as the histological counterpart of FIRS.Driscoll (1986)54, concluded that of these criteria, intrapartum maternal fever appears to be the most frequent. When at least 2 of the aforementioned criteria are present, the risk of neonatal sepsis is increased. Each clinical sign and symptom of chorioamnionitis, however, is by itself of low predictive value. The signs and symptoms of maternal chorioamnionitis or amniotic fluid infection are very subjective."
"Vytgotsky contributes an important idea to this discussion, referring us to the relevance of effective pedagogy in engaging such students. One of the best ways to accomplish this is through group activity. We have a core understanding of the fact that diversity implies not just a diversity of ethnicity or culture but also of potential learning styles or strategy."
"From a review of the scatter plots alone, it was difficult to tell which factors had the strongest impact on happiness and healthy life expectancy. Regression analysis assisted in assessing the best combination of features for happiness as well as a healthy life expectancy. All features included in the original study provided the best indicator of happiness"
"If a match is decided, a dowry must be agreed. -This is an illegal practice, but is still sometimes done. A dowry is a payment given to the groom\u2019s family by the bride\u2019s family because the groom\u2019s family now has to look after and pay for the bride. Because of the wedding\u2019s expense, the bride may find it quite difficult to get together enough money to pay what the groom has asked for and the marriage may therefore be called off. Some Hindu families now demand dowry free weddings."
"Sad to note, many of our youth today are represented by the characters in these two stories. While some obtain a college degree and land a good job, many do not find the right path because no one is there to guide them. In order to ensure their future, parents and elders alike should work hand in hand in guiding the youth. They should know how to listen to the children when the latter are making a point. They should also understand the youth, and support them in the difficult situations in life. Good guidance should come from the immediate environment such as the family, school, and community."
"The price we would pay as taxpayers to confiscate guns after a ban should lower crime rates and be worth it over time financially. If a gun ban was put into place in every state, we would be paying for the buyback programs and any other method of gun confiscation."
"When asked how her friends provide support for her, Ashley described the characteristics of informational support. There are four types of support that are provided between friends, those of which include informational, instrumental, companionship, and esteem (Peers, 2019). Informational support is when friends provide advice and guidance to one another in regards to personal issues. Instrumental support entails assisting friends with actual assignments, which can include but is not limited to, schoolwork in the case of adolescence. Companionships support encompasses the displaying of dependability on a friend to be there for you at social activities; and lastly esteem support involves individuals supporting each other in times of failure and celebrating together in times of success. Ashley described her friend\u2019s support as informational, and this was evident in how she described her interactions with friends. She specifically explained that when she was going through a break up, her friends were there to provide advice and be there for her. This demonstrated informational support. Talking with her friends about decisions and sharing advice amongst themselves appeared to be a commonality amongst Ashley\u2019s friends."
"We should also remember that the hero, along with his development, began to value his invisibility. And if we think of it from our own point of view, we may also find it sometimes helpful. Of course, it is insulting when people don\u2019t give you the recognition that you deserve, but let\u2019s look at it from the other angle."
"By doing this it will enhance the children\u2019s learning on the life cycle to leaves and other species. While doing this recommendation the teacher can also call some children up at the front, to hold up pictures of leaves during the cycle. I have looked at Jean Piaget as my theorist to support my recommendations for my Children playing with natural resources observation."
"Although the story of \u2018The Boy who Drew Cats\u2019 is a folktale that is fictitious, it illustrates a concept that poor environment and living conditions cannot stop one\u2019s dream. The little boy kept pursuing his dream even under a poor environment. His dream came true. He became a famous artist. Happiness comes from the satisfaction of his ability to become an artist. On the contrary, the two young girls in the story of \u2018The Standard of Living\u2019 lived in imagination only and they believe that materialism will bring them happiness. The girls could not achieve what they want if they kept imagining and without putting effort into changing their lives. In the contemporary world, some students, who come from vulnerable families, do not have extra money or resources to learn or to attend the tutorial classes. Despite poor environment and living conditions, they stay persistent and study hard, they finally get good results in the public examination. They endeavor to change their fate. It reflects that accomplishment can bring them happiness and satisfaction than materialistic conditions."
"Stereotypes can come in many forms. Commonly it is a belief that may have been subliminally imparted by peers, parents or the media. Stereotyping can cross all groups, genders, races, religions or even animals. It is possible social interaction or experience can lead to stereotyping especially if a negative experience is involved. People may all be guilty in some form of stereotyping, although not in a derogatory sense. Some common examples are, left handed people are creative, Asians are hard workers, blondes have more fun, fat people are jolly."
"George and Lennie were such good friends, you can even say they were brothers. Lennie wasn\u2019t the brightest star in the sky. It was hard for George to get mad at Lennie when he accidentally killed Curley\u2019s wife. Curley\u2019s wife had the soft feel of her hair and Lennie truly adored it, maybe a little too much. He killed her by breaking her neck while holding her hair, but he really didn\u2019t mean to kill her. Geaorge said, \u201dI ain\u2019t mad. I never been mad, an\u2019 I ain\u2019t now. That\u2019s a thing I want ya to know'(101). This shows how much George really cared about Lennie."
"Followed by an analysis of two authors opposing articles of immigration and border policies and how those concepts might have been used to write their articles. Finally, an exploration of the economic aspect of immigration and how those ideas might be helpful to develop immigration policy factors as well as how credible the sources appear to be. As we begin to reflect on Daniel Kahneman\u2019s theories of \u201cavailability heuristics,\u201d in his book \u201cThinking, Fast and Slow,\u201d he suggests that there are distinct concepts that factor how people use a mental shortcut when evaluating their thoughts on topics and decisions."
"In one line they are called as \u201cIndigenous Nationalities\u201d of Nepal. As per the last decade sensex came to know that Magar\u2019s are the maximum habitants living in all over Nepal. I was happy to know this as I, myself belong to Magar sub-caste. Further to my knowing i came across places where there were churches and mosques and Gurudwara\u2019s made and I also saw people going to these holy places to worship. At first I was astonish to find these holy places located in Nepal but then I could also figure that we are no more living in 20th Century but have widened are vision\u2019s and respect other religions too\u2026."
"At least in Steinbeck\u2019s book it was clear that although George was officious, he loved him. George\u2019s annoyance is weaker than his profound unity and one-ness with him. Curley\u2019s wife is described as a very racist, harmful, flirtatious person, who is all too aware of her power and consequently abuses it. For example, she threatens an innocent Crooks, \u201c\u2018Listen, Nigger,\u2019 she said, \u2018You know what I can do to you if you open your trap?'\u201d1 Sinise\u2019s depiction of her in the movie, however, is not as despicable. She holds a pitiable role and always is portrayed as the victim. The audience begins to sympathize with her, although, in the book, she was the one to initiate all the trouble."
"Mom is supportive and is working extra to provide extra income. Children have usual high school drama but appear well rounded. This family regularly has a \u2018family meeting\u2019 where there is open and non judgmental discussion of any issues. All major decisions are discussed with the entire family. Mom is from overseas but speaks with her family every Sunday. Overall this family is well educated and well adjusted. This health assessment notes some areas that this family can work on."

"If we consider the main criterion of multiculturalism the religious, ethnical or racial diversity of population in a\u00a0country, based on the afforecited data we may assume that France is a\u00a0multicultural country. On the other hand if the principal element of multiculturalism is the fact that the coexistence of each and every group takes place without grave problems and conflicts in everyday life, then it is not evident that France actually is a\u00a0multicultural society right because of racism, dicrimination and malfunction of the French socio-political regime. 2. Socio-political regime in France The problem of an effective integration of immigrants into the French society is one of the principal subjects that the French politics has been dealing with since the 1980s when young French of Maghrebi origine, so-called Beurs[2], protested in public against their discrimination at the time when France was confronted with the first headscarf affair in 1989. For that purpose, the French conceived a\u00a0socio-political regime of multiculturalism that would help immigrants to merge smoothly into the French society and resolve the occuring conflicts."
"People use racism as a sort of way to detect the differences with their peers and spike bias towards a group of people. Some people go the extra mile in insulting, attacking or mentally attacking others because of racist ideals they believe in. In the play Fences by August Wilson, Troy\u2019s dreams of becoming a professional baseball player got ripped away because of his racial appearance. This single experience has slowly made him look at life differently."
"This is important because it shapes how people where people where at those times; not liking a race just because they are better workers than them. This contradicts the act, from true facts of the document: \u201clabor was never cheap\u201d, this means that scarce work was never the problem but the actual immigrant people that were not as great workers. According to Chew\u2019s journal titled \u201cthe biography of a chinaman\u201d exposes the truth by showing facts on how Chinese people were mistreated, giving us reasons on why it all happened."
"For my sixth culture I chose the Nenets. In exchange for the bride-price the parents of the bride provide her with a dowry. For each 8 reindeer which they obtained from the bridegroom, they give a sledge to which are harnessed two reindeer, a choom, several nyuk, women\u2019s clothing, baked bread, cow\u2019s butter and venison, and at the end of each year the daughter comes to the father and takes away one reindeer. Both sides, having come to an agreement, grow freer in their conversation and designate a day for receiving the payment for the bride; then the groom\u2019s father invites 129 the outsiders who, having helped catch the reindeer, now all ride to the bride\u2019s choom, where the matchmaker slaughters a reindeer as a treat for the bride\u2019s relatives, and the bride\u2019s father reciprocates with the same thing, and presentations of raw meat begin on both sides."
"Direct discrimination This is when children and young people are not allowed to access part of the curriculum and school activities because of their particular situation such as race, gender or disability. An example is where a school does not accept a pupil because of their special educational need or a group of pupils do not let another pupil join in with them because of their race. Indirect discrimination This is more difficult to spot. Indirect discrimination occurs when practice and procedures are applied without consideration to individuals\u2019 circumstances."
"My interest in Mathematics and Science goes back to the time I was at school. It was in 10th Grade, I secured 97% and 95% marks in mathematics and science respectively. As I have been inclined towards Science and Mathematics, it eased my selection of Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics as my main subjects for Higher Secondary Education. During this period, my analytical abilities and quantitative reasoning have been my innate strength benefiting me in understanding the basic concepts and allowing me to secure an overall 99."
"Women in Sri Lanka from approximately 57% of a total estimated population of 21 millions. So women in Sri Lanka play a major role in the aspect of development. Another clear segment of the population on ethnic violence has impacted seriously are women. Sexual attacks on women have been a common military strategy throughout history (Dissanayake 2004). In the initial periods of the militarization of the inter-ethnic conflict, women were victimized when their husbands or other males, were abducted or killed by the security forces. They became widows or bereaved women. They also fallen victim to rape, and the worst period of rape was under the occupation of the Indian Peace Keeping Force, particularly between the months of November and December 1987 when the refugees were trickling back from their camps to the homes they had left behind in the midst of war. Comparatively the number of kidnapping of women, sexual harassment and rapes attributed to Tamil militant groups are minimal even though such cases also exist as indicated by a number of unpublished personal testimonies recorded by some researchers and human rights activists. (Dissanayake,2004). In conservative Tamil society, with privileged notions of chastity, virginity before marriage and restrictive notions of purity, women are placed in an extremely difficult position when many of these notions would be violated in a situation of rape. The fact that rape was not a result of their own activities plays no part in the popular perception of the rape victim, and the social seclusion of such victims. In fact they were victimized by more than one aggressor. That is firstly by the rapist, and then by their own society. So in one hand they become victims in their own society and the separation of those women from society adversely affect to the development of Sri Lanka."
"In another episode of the show Brooklyn Nine Nine called \u201cThe Big House part 1\u201d, it illustrates the inmate subculture in prisons as well as the severity of inmate gangs. The inmate subculture can be defined as the certain forms of relationships and interactions that occur between the inmates in prison (Griffiths, page 248). While serving their sentences, inmates are forced to become socialized with the values and norms and culture of the prison, one of which might be joining an inmate gang (Griffiths, page 248). In this episode, one of the detectives has been placed in a prison to serve his sentence and seeks protection from the other inmates by attempting to join a gang. In order for Jake to be part of the gang, he has to get a guard that the gang leader dislikes fired. Jake decides the best way to get the guard fired is by filming him getting physically assaulted by the guard and showing it to the warden."
"One of the many claims that Americans typically make is that these illegal aliens are taking over jobs and are not paying taxes. Another claim is that Americans believe all immigrants are criminals and bring violence with them wherever they go. Numerous amount of people hold different and multiple misconceptions about immigrants. The current president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, has shown many examples of having unethical communication and opinions against immigrants or \u201cillegal aliens.\u201d By studying the policies and different perspectives of people who are against or are for immigrants living in the United States, I argue that immigrants should be capable and eligible of having more freedom and deserve to be treated like any other person living in the United States."
"However, Drug Detection dogs are only trained to find different narcotics without getting distracted by other scents. Scent Tracking dogs focus on tracking a certain scent of a suspect who has fled or a missing person, no matter the intensity of the smell. The best breeds for this job are Bloodhounds and Beagles because of their strong nose. Each of these dogs is placed with a handler after its initial training, which will then be continued on duty and when home with it\u2019s owner. Dogs are also very helpful on farms. Like Police Force dogs, these dogs must be easily trainable and be able to maintain a high level of energy. Their job is to round up the animals, normally cows, goats, or sheep. The hardest part about training a dog to herd is that you do not want them to treat your livestock like prey, but you want them to stay fierce and competitive. They circle the livestock or nip at their feet to direct herds in and out of certain areas."
"This article is useful as research for my essay as Hughes shows how the death penalty has executed innocent people in the past which is one of the reasons why Australia should not re-introduce capital punishment. This article is a limited source of information since it only discusses one innocent man that was executed in Australia. It is still\u00a0useful however since it does show that capital punishment is not always judged correctly, executing innocent people. This article will be useful from my essay to debate whether the death penalty should or should not be brought back to Australia as it will give me another arguing point."
"Understand how to monitor children and young people\u2019s development and interventions that should take place if this is not following the expected pattern. 3. 1 Explain how to monitor children and young people\u2019s development using different methods. Methods: Observation. Children can change according to who they are with and whether they know that they are being watched. This means that you will need to observe children in a range of different situations, e. g. with other children, playing by themselves and when they are with an adult."

She also tells the story to Lena for the first time, hopping that she may learn from her mother\u2019s failure and can take proper decision in life."
"Police violence is disproportionately affecting black people, along with Hispanics and people with native American backgrounds. Yet, we have seemingly ended racism so, it\u2019s just a coincidence, right? We, after all, did elect a black man to become president, so this is obviously a post-racial America. A post racial America where all lives should matter instead of just the ones being disproportionately shot and killed by police officers. Bill Maher expressed that \u201cAll Lives Matter implies that lives are equally at risk, and they\u2019re not.\u201d By saying \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d, it is an attempt to diminish the ongoing reality of the fact that white supremacy still exists. By saying \u201cAll Lives Matter,\u201d they are silencing those trying to make a difference and take down the unjust that holds racial equality at bay."
"The subject of identity has long been a contentious site in theoretical perspective for many years. Freud\u2019s groundbreaking theories with regard to formation of self hood and other anthropological theories has only helped to twist this confusion into a concept which cannot be contained in a single theory alone. From the view of sociological concepts it is a system among groups that are motivated differently to act. As a result identity becomes a basic analytical concept which is in straightforward connection with a number of coexisting groups that interact with each other deciding their criteria for recognition."
"Deeper thoughts are stimulated in the audience when the theme of appearance vs. reality is used. It is a message within a message. Nadine Gordimer, Julio Polanco and Evanescence are only a few of the artists who use this theme. In their works, they show that appearance is only serves as a blindfold to the truth; appearance exists because reality can become too hard to face and lastly, use it as a means of expression. The theme of appearance vs. reality is like a matryoshka doll, the message is there, you just have to go through all the other layers."

"\u201d Armand met Desiree when she was eighteen when he rode past her as \u201cshe stood one day against the stone pillar\u201d (Chopin 431). He \u201cfell in love, as if struck by a pistol shot\u201d (Chopin 431) their love was so sudden where he hardly knew her but they both still got married quickly and had a son. Monsieur Valmond\u00e9 wanted to make sure that D\u00e9sir\u00e9e\u2019s unknown origin was to be considered by Armand before making the hasty decision to get married but did not care much over her unknown origins because he was so much in love. He decided himself that he would give her his own last name if she did not have a family name of her own. Not only Armand is blinded by his emotions, Desiree was strongly pushed by her emotions also. She wasn\u2019t just affected by her own emotions, the emotions of her husband swayed her thoughts, \u201cThis was what made the gentle D\u00e9sir\u00e9e so happy, for she loved him desperately. When he frowned she trembled, but loved him. When he smiled, she asked no greater blessing of God\u201d (Chopin 432). In the story, we can slowly infer that Armand loved D\u00e9sir\u00e9e\u2019s outer beauty, not her inner beauty. To him she was only a trophy wife in his eyes. Armand not only see her an object, but also also as a blank page where he is able to form her in any shape that he is able to due to that fact that she has no known background. This somewhat gives him more dominance over her because she has no family that could be angered by the way he will treat her. When he finds that his child is not of pure white blood, he goes out of his way to discard the trophy."
"\u201cTransport as a whole is responsible for about a quarter of the world\u2019s carbon dioxide discharges. That makes it one of the biggest sources, alongside power generation and households.

"Unlike curly Slim\u00a0has confidence in himself and doesn\u2019t have visible insecurities about him, which makes Slim a great leader and a role model to the other people in the ranch.

The way they perceive and view the world is also different because of factors like behavior, beliefs, and feelings, slim is looked at as a leader while Curley is looked as a \u201cpunk\u201d this is a result of their actions. No two persons can regard in the same way because everyone has a different perspective of life and have a different way of thinking."

"Gelman et al. (2007) looked at pedestrian stop data by the New York City Police Department and found that Hispanics and African-Americans are subjected to more searches than people of other races. Close and Mason (2007), used a sample of Florida vehicle searches and found that African-American drivers, mostly males, have the highest probability of being searched when in comparison to drivers of other races, male or female. When doing research on whether the police officers in the United States are racist and use excessive force there are some factors to be considered. One of the factors is the goal of the police officers. Many people are confused whether police officers use excessive force in order to find contraband or if it is used in order to minimize crime. A study in 2006 showed that while arrest rate maximization is consistent with having equal search success rates, it is very inconsistent with the minimization of crimes. Some people assume that since crime rates among races differ, that the search rates should reflect the amount and levels of crimes. There is also a misconception about the level of crimes by specific races. People believe that this will affect that police officer\u2019s behavior even if they personally do not hold discriminatory beliefs (Ajilore & Shirey, 2017)."
"As regards nonverbal communication, maintaining eye contact can be interpreted as intimidating. Latino social norms give emphasis to the importance of communication in interpersonal relationships.

"All Indonesian schoolchildren are required to learn this language, called Bahasa Indonesia. It was developed from Trade Malay, one of the most widespread hybrid languages used by Indonesians. Bahasa Indonesia also contains elements borrowed from the ethnic languages, particularly Javanese. English is taught in the schools as well. Most Indonesians live in rural areas and are farmers, though they generally raise only enough food crops to feed their own families. About 78 percent of the population is classified as rural, and about 60 percent of the labor force works directly in agriculture."
"An example of symbolism used in this poem is seen in the line, \u201cThey send me to eat in the kitchen when company comes.\u201d It has two meanings. The literal meaning means the employers send him away when guests arrive. The other meaning means America trying to conceal her racial \u201cproblems\u201d to show the world a different image of the country. Another example is \u201cI\u2019ll sit at the table.\u201d The literal meaning just means to sit at a table, but it also symbolizes being in charge and making decisions. These comparisons and symbols illustrate the point so well that they increase the effectiveness of the poem."
"According to pregnancy. rg a fetuses nervous system does not develop until after five weeks into the pregnancy. After that period the baby has already began to develop major organs and the nervous system. An egoist view on abortion would be based on one question. According to socyberty. com, an egoist would focus on what will be in her best interest. This would not mean the woman is selfish or self-centered. For example, maybe the women would be in a predicament where she would be a single mom. On the other hand, maybe she has not emotional of financial support to help er care for the child. In her case, her best interest would be to abort the child because it is in her best interest."
"She has describes herself as a \u201cpractical deconstructionist feminist Marxist\u201d and as a \u201cgadfly\u201d.

In her work, she combines passionate denunciations of the harm done to women, non-Europeans, and the poor by the privileged West with a persistent questioning of the grounds on which radical critique takes its stand."
"Mrs Allonby continuously challenges the boundaries of what is acceptable to be spoken about in polite society. Wilde himself is also challenging the boundaries, there is a subtext here of Mrs Allonby\u2019s sexual boredom. She goes on about the size and shape of Earnest\u2019s chin which almost makes it seem like the women are speaking in code about male sexual inadequacy."
"The next change is the introduction of notices and restrictions. Some examples are easements, restrictive covenants or burden of leases. A restriction on the other hand governs situations in where the nature of an estate which is registered or charge may be forced upon entry on the register. Hence, if a trustee has a limitation placed upon his powers, this must be recorded and shown on the register. This would provide a clearer picture to the purchaser about the land he is about to purchase which would further push the use of mirror principle. Another change is regarding harges. For example, it has prospectively abolished charges by way of sub-demise and demise. Furthermore, it has also changed the set of rules in regards to the importance of further advances if in any case the property is subsequently charged. The main change effected by this act is to apply the current practice whereby lenders take it on themselves to inform prior chargees of any further and subsequent charge made based on the land, hence, this would hinder the prior charge from giving out any future advances on the security of his earlier charge."
"Fotso et al. (2009), while looking at the influence of women\u2019s decision- making on maternal health among Nairobi women in Kenya concluded that, education, household wealth, demographic and health covariates had strong relationships with place of delivery but women\u2019s decision making was rather a weak determinant. Even though researches on the influence of women\u2019s decision-making on maternal health have been conducted in various countries, for instance, Mali, Philippines and Ethiopia, there was need for a study interrogating determinants of maternal health in Ainamoi Constituency due to variation in cultures hence the study employed ethnographic research design to establish the relationship between women\u2019s decision-making power within the family among the Kipsigis and their utilization of maternal healthcare services."
"Racism occurs all over the world. To believe that there would be a point where racism wouldn\u2019t exist is too idealistic. Racism has occurred in the past and racism continues to occur today. When people say that racism doesn\u2019t exist as much as it used to or when they used the words \u201cimproved\u201d or \u201cbetter\u201d to describe it, they are either speaking from their opinion or they are to an extent true. Yes, it is true that there is no more slavery; it is true that people aren\u2019t as discriminatory to African Americans as they used to be, but as a matter of fact, something doesn\u2019t end when it shifts."
"Parts of Baldwin\u2019s argument about education\u2019s effect on society and how racism is viewed and indirectly taught, still occurs today.

"In conclusion, police brutality is an unfortunate issue. I would like to send my sincere condolences to all those black lives lost that ended in a confrontation with a police officer. As for the families we understand nothing will ever be able to fill in the void you feel in your hearts. We need this acknowledged so justice can come to pass. Stepfather, you must arise to these difficult situations to change the law. Something must be done to stop this nonsense. So, we do not have to lose any more loved ones. I will never understand, why is it that bad things happen to good people? There is a long line in history where police brutality has occurred, yet we are all human beings. All of our lives are precious. This trend of of police brutality must be stopped. Stepfather, you must ask yourself, what is really going to stop this from happening again? We must change how cops think or else we will be marching forever."

"Another argument used by supporters of the death penalty in past years involves \u201cthe incapacitation theory, which suggests that we need to execute the most heinous killers in order to prevent them from killing again\u201d (Radelet & Borg, 200, page 3). The authors discuss how recent research studies have found that those on death row tend to make better adjustment to prison and if released, they exhibit lower rates of repeating the offense."

"Ways to encourage a child to behave properly can be by giving rewards and praise for being good. Forms of rewards can be from sweets to toys or even helping out in future activities. Giving sweets isn\u2019t as rewarding as it may seem as this affects children\u2019s behaviour as many children become hyperactive and also they may expect this reward every time but if these are given the behaviour may change for the worse. A better reward would be fruit and a sticker showing the child that they have been good and that they could receive these each time."
"Also, she offers a prediction that the strategy could, \u201creduce the illegal population from its current 11.5 million to 5.6 million in a period of five years, a 51 percent reduction,\u201d (cis.org, 2012). Considering the scope of these outcomes and the results of the actual data producing statistics not even remotely close indicate that the current enforcement programs are ineffective, but continue to experience budget growth. Still, in the simple context of theoretical presumptions, heightened security measures and the overall approach of adopting strict immigration laws should ideally yield the capacity to generate a mass reduction in the unauthorized immigrant population over time, and provide greater collective protection against the most dangerous criminals and/or terrorists that are considered threats to the United States. However, another alarming statistic mentioned by immigrant attorney Tara Magner from an analysis done by Syracuse University research proves the liability of these assumptions at which, \u201cIt found that less than 0.01% of arrests of noncitizens by Homeland Security agents were terrorist related,\u201d (Magner, 3). With the steady growth of enforcement budgets continuing at the forefront of US immigration policy, one can conclude that the current system is in desperate need of more cost-efficient and highly beneficial reforms."
"In the most general form of Patience, the objective of the game is to build up four blocks of cards going from ace to king in each suit by taking cards from the layout if they appear on the table.There is a huge modification on the patience theme by using one or more decks of cards, with rules of intricacy and skill levels. Many of them are converted into electronic form and are available as computer games."

This gives the idea that the children have a reckless nature, they are the lower class. This is a gang of kids that the author was not allowed to hang around, but he must have felt very lonely."
"Besides stereotyping being hurtful, it is wrong as well. Even though the stereotype can be correct in some occasions; relentlessly putting an individual down on the basis of predetermined perceptions cannot assist in motivating one to succeed. Stereotyping only gears people to lead lifestyles of hatred and in some situations stereotypes victims live in fear."

Many have fallen defending our country so that we can have our freedom Everyday they continue to shape our country\u2019s future and help move us forward The dedication that they have towards our country makes me realize how lucky I am to be living here in the United States, They love this country so much that they would spend months on end just to make sure that our country is protected, All of those who have died fighting for our rights to me is considered a hero."
"Within my support I explain to the children that the words may sound differently but the spellings they always received had sounds in common so therefore pointing this out they was able to think of the starting of the word and knew each work has the same sound in and was then able to achieve more marks out of ten on their spellings. This helped to boost their confidence and self-esteem because they knew they could do it. Young people that attend college and university aged between 16-25 may carry out key skills/functional skills."
"The only thing that changes the mood of the poem is when he thinks about his dead yesterdays (ancestors) and unborn tomorrows (grand-children and nomads) -Here one thing must be noted that he dreams about these people not about his own children. Patel wanted to convey the idea of unseen sincerity of millions of fathers who strive hard for their family and their people. Dilip Chitre\u2019s poem \u201cFather Returning Home\u201d is selected from \u201cTravelling in A Cage\u201d. It speaks about the dull and exhausting daily routine of a commuter. Delinked from his family he is left with himself to talk."
"Therefore when faced with the ethical dilemma of whether to have an abortion or not, according to egoism, one must first ask themselves several questions to do a self assessment to find out exactly what is the best path for them in the long run. Questions like; Am I ready to put my personal goals on hold to care for a child? Am I attached to this unborn child in any way? Do I ever want to have kids? Would I be a good parent without the support of others? Or can I live with my decision for the rest of my life? Knowing the right course of our lives isn\u2019t always clear. Therefore egoism is not a concrete method for decision making, as far as I\u2019m concerned"
"This can be an argument many may focus on to oppose police brutality. Doubters may argue and say that the victims of the \u201cpolice brutality\u201d were being rude or hateful to the police, or in other words utilizing their beliefs of reverse racism. The American culture towards racism has changed significantly throughout history. Today, Americans have many different views of the policemen and policewomen of their county. It is well known that police brutality exists due to intolerance and racism. However, there are some police that are very good citizens who are role models to these kids such as Bobby White. Although there are many that are aware of the brutality and the racist police, it is not an adequate amount. Millions, if not billions of dollars are paid to settle brutality cases throughout the United States. Baltimore alone had about 5.4 million dollars spent on theses cases in just three years. That money is an amount that many many people will never see or make in their lifetimes, yet that does not mean it is enough to cover the police\u2019s brutal actions. Money can never replace the value of citizens\u2019 lives, no matter the amount of money. American culture must adapt even more to the police brutality in order to completely eliminate it. The only way this can be solved is from major friendly protests, due to corrupt local governments."
"After a while, the two bonded and where Walt helped him through manhood by toughening him up, providing dating advice and helping him get a job in construction. During this, Walt learned that Thao had tried to steal the car to be a part of the gang that he confronted earlier in the movie.

"Most children\u2019s Literature is used for entertainment, learning and conveying messages. The majority of children\u2019s literature has a dual target audience of children and adults. I will be comparing the text of the Mail online and the Roald Dahl website. The presentation of both texts is very different. For example, pictures in the Mail online appeal to a range of people. In the article there are two pictures. One is a photograph of Scott McIntyre, his son and a packshot of the book he wrote."
"\u201cThis diagnosis was associated with increased recall of traumatic memories that were reported by a child personality. The child personality was able to recognize only half of the memories reported by the host personality. The patient\u2019s responses were dissimilar to responses of control and non-experiment participants. These findings suggest that DID is associated with alterations in autobiographical memory and that memories differ across personalities\u201d (Bryant, 1995)."
"To their credit, the courts of ancient Israel required very high levels of proof of criminality before they would order the death penalty (Horwitz, 1973, 36) Of course, a person may think it is immoral to kill someone no matter what they have done. When I say it is retributive justice to take the life in turn for the taking of another life, it could be argued that a criminal is not able to learn a lesson since he dies as an immediate result of the punishment. How can this be called punishment if no lesson is taught? In my opinion, the only way for justice to be served is to have the criminal pay with their life, \u201c an eye for an eye.\u201d"
"Physical abuse is a prevalent ongoing issue that affects one\u2019s life in more ways than one, such as, the relationships they develop over time. This form of trauma takes a toll on your present and future relationships. Victims of abuse tend to isolate themselves voluntarily. They begin to have trust issues, causing them to not trust anyone, and they tend to push the people who care about them away that want to help them. These relationships consist of children to adults, women to men, men to women, women to women, and men to men, it affects relationships between family members as well."
"I haven\u2019t experienced anything in my community from a global factor. But I have been noticing that the quarter is no longer worth what it used to be, I\u2019m not sure if this is because of a global factor or just a national factor but no longer do I get what I used to for a quarter. Last week my family and I went washing at a local laundry matt, while we were removing our clothes\u00a0from the washer getting ready to placed them in the drier we realized that now instead of getting 10 minutes of drying time for one quarter it was now only 8 minutes."
"The narrator in \u2018Crackling Day\u2019 shows ignorance and confusion quite clearly whilst he is completing his job to receive the crackling. Whilst he is talking to the white man serving out the crackling he didn\u2019t know he needs to say \u2018baas\u2019 Andries has to nudge him and tell him what to say because he is not aware of how to address the white man in this community. Also he doesn\u2019t know that he should avoid the white children because Andries says \u201cBetter run for it\u201d and the narrator replies \u201cWhy?\u201d This shows the narrators ignorance of the situation he is in as he does not realise the power of the white children. In \u2018The Gold Cadillac\u2019 the narrator shows ignorance of the situation when it says \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why the signs were there and I asked my father what they meant.\u201d She was confused when she saw the signs \u201cWHITES ONLY, COLOUREDS NOT ALLOWED.\u201d and could not figure out why they were there. It also shows innocence when it says \u201cThey searched my father I didn\u2019t understand why. I didn\u2019t understand either why they had called my father a liar.\u201d This shows ignorance of racial discrimination because they had grown up in a safe, trustworthy environment where there was no discrimination. As soon as she is put in this situation she is confused and \u201cfelt as if I was in a foreign land\u201d because of the racial discrimination. There is a similarity between the two stories in this sense as they both show a sense of confusion when they are put in situations of racial prejudice that are not normal to them. The ignorance and confusion helps us see what the children are feeling when they come across situations that are not logical to them."
"Less than 1% of deaths are classified as brain deaths, but these cases make up the majority of donations, as doctors prefer organs that are still connected to a functioning heart and body. It is imperative that health care professionals make sure that family members are educated about organ donation and what exactly the term bran dead means. It is also of the utmost importance that people whom desire to become organ donors are educated about their decision and share their information. This is so important because at the end, it is the decision of the organ donor, to have their organs donated. People can only hope that their family members are left with the knowledge that their family member passed away being a hero. They were able to give someone else the gift of life."
"Abortion is a topic that is very controversial in the United States. Thousands of people debate whether having a procedure to abort an embryo is ethical or not. Our country is torn in half with 48% of people having the opinion that having an abortion is morally wrong. It is in America\u2019s favor to allow abortions to remain legal for anyone who wishes to have the procedure. A large amount of the United States\u2019 population expects abortion to remain at least mostly legal in the future. Taking everything that has been said into account, it is unconstitutional, threatening women\u2019s health, and safety risks to ban abortions in the United States."
"In health and social care a lot of people work with and support people with varying degrees of disabilities. The Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) makes it unlawful to discriminate against someone who has a disability. The act covers employment, access to goods, facilities and services of organisations, education, buying and renting a property and transportation services."
"Ask history questions about previous pregnancies and births along with assessing how far along she is with the current pregnancy. Rationale: The nurse should ask questions to figure out one\u2019s gravidity and parity and how previous births of children went in order to have a better understanding of how the current delivery may go. The nurse should also determine the gestational age of the fetus to interpret how well developed the baby will be."
"Another action that can be taken to resolve the immigration issue is by aiding DACA and its recipients. \u201cDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is a kind of administrative relief from deportation. The purpose of DACA is to protect eligible immigrant youth who came to the United States when they were children from deportation. DACA gives young undocumented immigrants protection from deportation and a work permit. The program expires after two years, subject to renewal\u201d (What is DACA?). DACA recipients are the offspring of illegal immigrants who identify and live like Americans. Many of them have lived in the United States for the majority of their lives and have no real correlation with their birth country. Unfortunately, these young people were without a clear pathway to citizenship under the current immigration law. \u201cDACA has enabled individuals in communities across the country to come out of the shadows, get drivers licenses, obtain access to higher education and necessary skill sets, and find work. With this opportunity, DACA recipients have demonstrated that they are American in every way, despite being undocumented\u201d (Heinrich, 2019). DACA is a win-win situation for everyone. This benefits the young immigrants, society and even the economy. However, President Trump decided to end this program. \u201cThe economic impact of rescinding DACA will negatively affect individuals beyond recipients and their families, including employers who have hired DACA recipients, as well as communities where DACA recipients are active economic and social participants. The repeal of DACA will place an extreme hardship and burden on U.S. businesses, on local communities, and the American economy. According to an analysis by the Center for American Progress, rescinding DACA would result in an estimated loss of $460.3 billion from the national GDP over the next decade. Ending DACA would also remove an estimated 685,000 workers from the nation\u2019s economy over the next two years\u2014at a rate of more than 30,000 jobs a month\u2014leaving employers in a lurch to fill these positions. Further, replacing these individuals is expected to cost employers more than $3.4 billion in unnecessary turnover costs. President Trump\u2019s decision to end DACA is an effort to please his conservative, anti-immigrant base. Scoring political points instead of providing policy solutions will only produce negative economic consequences for Americans across the country. Congress must find a solution that will protect Dreamers and the American economy from this damaging, inhumane action by President Trump\u201d (Heinrich, 2019). Helping DACA will only cause good outcomes. Removing this program is a mistake that will not only worsen the immigration problem but the economy as well."
"The most serious of these problems, as Tendulkar shows us, is domestic violence and domestic abuse. For instance, we see occasions in Kanyadaan where Dalit, the husband, chooses to drink and abuse his wife, and the helpless wife can do nothing about it. We see in Kanyadaan how not only is the girl who chooses to cross the barriers of tradition for her love, affected by it, but also her father who was the person who developed the values of modernism in her."
"Though the government will continue to use this unethical way to punish the convicted, there are numerous organizations and groups of people who are abolitionist trying to outlaw the death penalty altogether. Certainly there are other ways to enforce fear in criminals, without actually killing them but yet we chose to unsympathetically end their lives. The United States should realize how much we are truly spending on executions, for these criminals who don\u2019t even deserved such a luxury. Death is the easy way out for most, sure it\u2019d be painful for them, but they deserve a lifetime of pain; life in prison offers them a torture much worse than death. As a nation we need to realize how truly wrong it is to take someone\u2019s life, we need to realize we\u2019re superior. It is the government\u2019s job to encourage justice, not punish the guilty. Almost every species kills, but only one chooses to willingly kill their own, humans. \u201cThe wrong thing done for the right reason is still the wrong thing\u201d (Charmed Quotes)."
"Men marry to show their wealth and power because who have more than one wife they are wealthier. There is no love between men and women in China. \u201cWu Tsing had asked her to be his concubine, not for love, but because ofthe prestige of owning what so many other men wanted.\u201d (p.234)."
"If someone could give her financial assistance to help her have a miscarriage in a clean environment, she would never let the physician who used unsterilized surgical tools do the surgery for her. If contraception was legal at that time, who would hurt themselves in this way, and put their lives at risk?"
"The idea of a perfect friendship brings us back to Aristotle who descripts this reflection as \u2018another self.\u2019 (Aristotle, and Ross. 2016: 365) Yet, another prominent figure who touches on the same subject is Michel de Montaigne (1533-1592) who writes as follows: \u2018If a man should importune me to give a reason why I loved him, I find it could no otherwise be expressed, than by making answer: because it was he, because it was I\u2019 (Montaigne and Cotton. 2016) Thus, when searching for someone to mirror ourselves we look not to find a friend who is too much like ourselves but rather someone who can challenge us. In short, someone who has the qualities we lack. But then again, many say that \u2018opposites attract\u2019 and thus one may question oneself why Mr Holmes and his arch-enemy Mr James Moriarty are not the best of friends. In their case if following Aristotle\u2019s logic for friendship which states that in order for a friendship to flourish one needs \u2018mutual goodwill and virtue.\u2019 (Aristotle, and Ross. 2016) These two pillars of friendship which Mr Moriarty lacks greatly even though he is as intelligent as Mr Holmes."
"The Gempaaten was an open rectangular court approximately 300m by 200m enclosed with a mud-brick wall, surrounding this was a roofed colonnade. The temple itself was adorned with colossal statues of Akhenaten. The decorative scenes shown in the temple showed a celebration of the Heb-sed festival in the second and third year of the king\u2019s reign. According to an unknown source in the depictions of the first year the ritual was enacted before officials from all the districts and the gods of Egypt, whose statues had been brought from near and far to be placed in shrines."
"Willy Loman is, for Miller, the antithesis of the classic tragic hero. As his name implies, he is a `low man\u2019, an everyday man, whose dreams and expectations have been shattered by the capitalistic values of the society that he failed to see. Unlike the heroes of classical tragedy, he is not a man of stature or noble purpose but he commands our respect and pity because he pursues his dream with a passionate intensity that makes him unique and gives him a heroic quality. While Willy is flawed in many ways, his tragic flaw, or hamartia, is not knowing himself. His inability to see and accept who he is leads to his final act. His suicide, an act in defiance of the system which until now had defeated him, is a tragic attempt to salvage in death the dream he couldn\u2019t attain while living."
"I am so happy to have finally found a college that offers Human and Community Services as an online course When looking over the course description I have noticed that it has a very comprehensive outline of the program, including what can be done once a degree in Human and Community Services is achieved. 1 look forward to learning about the development of humans in different social conditions and applying that knowledge to my life experiences by helping people in my community or rather the world."
"Domestic violence exists within all kinds of relationships and in some cases older children could get violent or abusive towards their parents and so the equation between the parent and child could be abusive both ways and in either case there are possibilities of domestic violence. Some common factors have been identified in defining the experiences of"
"I think this added suspense as the drama could be immediately stopped at any precise moment and also made the audience feel more involved. As we were all circling the freeze frame, Ruth who played the same character of Katie walked on stage and clicked her fingers. We all froze. Ruth, looking at the scene in front of her, looked distressed and confused. She was saying things like, \u2018this is not right, it\u2019s not like this\u2019 to herself as she walked up to the frozen scene. As she reached the scene of \u2018herself\u2019 getting raped, she started to change it. She straightened up Katie\u2019s jacket and did up Eliot\u2019s tie."
"That means the child is able to figure out a way to do the activity properly without asking the teacher for help. However sometimes the child needs to have an introduction to certain activities by the teacher. Those introductions have to be clear and brief. It is also important for the teacher to find the right time to introduce an activity. Montessori classrooms do not have a timetable like other traditional nurseries have, so the child is not forced to join in on any group activities. To not encourage competition and humiliation there are no rewards and punishments within a Montessori classroom."
"Children have a right of association. They have a right to meet and to join groups and organizations. Not all groups joined by children are acceptable by their parents or guardians; this brings a clash between the children\u2019s right of association and prevention of joining them. Children are also restricted from joining into these groups if they stop other people from enjoying their rights. For instance a rioting group which will probably cause peace disturbance to others, or an outlawed group will not be acceptable that the children join (CRC)."
"Owing to the radical modifications that bride price presently passes through, I think that the practice has to be revised. Most of these drastic changes are on account of the economic crisis. The cattle that the groom gave to the bride\u2019s family have been substituted by a substantial amount of cash. Furthermore, the cattle and or the money enabled bride\u2019s brother to pay their lobolo. Currently, bride\u2019s father uses the money as he pleases (Bourdillon 37). Reached at this level, astonishingly, one would put a question: what spiritual symbolism does the money have in connection with ancestors? And since it is a culture that must be carried on and transmitted from age to the other, why does the bride\u2019s father have to use the money for his own purposes, rather than on the original purpose? These radical changes depict the practicality and flexibility of the culture in walking rhythmically with time; when the environment and the circumstances change, the culture also suffers some modifications and it adapts itself so as to fit in."
"The friendship between Ramatoulaye and Aissatou\u2019s families goes back to the time when their grandmothers would \u2018exchange messages daily.\u20192 Ramatoulaye and Aissatou were also always best friends. Both women were well educated and both women choose to become teachers and serve society. As Ramatoulaye says, \u2018teachers are a noble army accomplishing daily feats, never praised, never decorated."
"That American citizens have a right to own firearms is conclusive and irrefutable. Due to this argument, it\u2019s only right for the people of America to embrace the right to protect your homes and family by having the right to purchase a weapon. People also value the right to have a gun for personal pleasure. There are men and women that enjoy the sport of hunting and those of us that love to go out to a range and shoot at target. According to The Pros & Cons (2014), if we opt not to legalize guns, we would potentially increase Black Market trade and ruin commercial trade, hinder evidence for prosecution, influence effects of socialism and totalitarianism to be seen upon a country\u2019s social and government infrastructures."
"This statement of this geography of difference is often the same as the account of poverty as far as political system is concerned. Difference is the core characteristic of capitalism, and the steep organization of capitalist inequality or its class system is, like poverty, spread across the area of the city and reappears at the flat area made by capitalism as a reflection of its class (vertical) organization of power."
"\u201d Musk added. \u201cI do think we need to be very careful about the advancement of AI.\u201d (2018) Artificial intelligence, if not taken care of properly, could turn into a very dangerous mistake. People say \u201clearn from your mistakes\u201d but a journalist Maureen Dowd says that we don\u2019t want to learn from our mistake with artificial intelligence (Piper). Joe Rogan talks with Elon Musk about why he\u2019s worried about AI and Elon says, \u201cSomething\u2019s going to happen, and we aren\u2019t going to be able to control it."
"After introducing us to one of the creatures in Wonderland, the Gryphon, for instance, the narrator tells us, \u201cIf you don\u2019t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.\u201d As noted earlier, Wonderland is filled with strange animals, and Alice\u2019s encounters with these creatures, all of whom engage her in conversations, confuse her even more whenever she meets yet another inhabitant of this strange country."
"Finally, methane is another issue that causes global warming. Methane is also a greenhouse gas. Methane is more effective in trapping heat in the atmosphere that carbon dioxide by 20 times. Usually methane gas can release from many areas. For instance, it can be from cattle, landfill, natural gas, petroleum systems, coal mining, mobile explosion, or industrial waste process."
"However, the Indians argue that knowledge from books is useless for living in their world. As Indians children that was sent to study at the white\u2019s collages comes back as \u201cbad runners, ignorant of every means of living in the woods, unable to bear either cold or hunger\u201d \u201cneither fit for hunters, warriors nor counselors\u201d and simply \u201cgood for nothing\u201d The learning culture for the whites is therefore different from the cultures of Indians one values knowledge from book but another values life experience and the ability to survive."
"The relationships that the narrators\u2019 share with the rest of their helps the reader to recognise and reiterate the suffering that living in this kind of society caused, whilst the endings, where the families come together and help each other, help to show how the family love is still the most important thing."
"The parent\u2019s evenings recently took place at the school where I work. During each appointment, the teacher had to explain to the parents of each pupil, exactly how their child was progressing in school. Some children had been doing very well, and so the teacher had many positive points to explain to happy parents, but, some children had not managed to achieve the targets set, or had a lower than acceptable rate of attendance."
"tensions in the host nations. Immigrants from the developing nations brought the host nations the same benefits that the migration of Europeans brought to the Americas a century before. 2. Immigrant communities in Europe and the United States are made up of young adults and tend to have fertility rates higher than the rates of the host populations. In the long run this will lead to increases in the Muslim population in Europe and in the Asian and Latin American populations in the United States, and to cultural conflicts over the definitions of citizenship and nationality. E. Technological and Environmental Change"
"By being true to herself she was able to reach out to Maggie as well as show Dee that she did not always have to get her way. The point of view found used in these two stories differed; giving the reader a different reading experience for each. \u201cBarn Burning\u201d had a third person, \u201cmultiple narrative presence\u201d (Ford, 1), whereas \u201cEveryday Use\u201d was first person. The narrator in Faulkner\u2019s \u201cBarn Burning\u201d was textured with both an anonymous narrator and one of Sarty\u2019s character twenty years after the events in the story take place. Using this technique, Faulkner allows the readers the full experience of what Sarty is going through."

It was successful as well because after identify the problem he advocates a programme with all the capacities to be triumphant in a short run."
"Now I wanted to do the same professional job in the U. S as in China. To chase my dream, I knew that first I needed to improve my English skills.

After two years of study, I successfully completed the ESL courses and received an award for outstanding."
"In Craven\u2019s film Scream, it was Sidney\u2019s deceased mother, Maureen, who caused Sidney to be subjected to a horrifying life or death situation.

Ghostface specifically pointed out how Sidney will \u201cdie, just like [her] mother . Showing that they were behind the murder of Maureen a year before the film takes place."
"I believe that if you are a Christian parent, and you believe in the faith 100%, and your life is definitely a Christian life, you should encourage your child to be a Christian, because you know that it is a good way to live, but you should never force your child. The Christian religion is does teach the right things but you should let them explore their own life, and let them make their own decisions, otherwise they will never be independent, they will never be free."
"The higher crime rate, argues Bourgois, occurs for the most part within the factions of the underground economy, and social relationships. With an unbiased sight the author looks at the underground economy, from baby sitting, off-track betting, to drug dealing, as these were the means which most of the families living in El Barrio were able to survive. This book is generally a synopsis of the events that occurred during Bourgois stay in El Barrio. The original purpose of the book was to write a first-hand account of racial prejudice and ethnic segregation in the heart of one of the worlds largest cities."
"However there are critisms of Murdock as he doesn\u2019t take into account the diversity of the ways in which co-residence, economic relations, sexuality and reproduction. Many sociologists say that they are simply western values and ideas of what a family should be like and assume that everyone will agree. (Jessie Bernard 1973 cited by Gittins pg. 3) Another criticism is that families do not need adults of both sexes, or a heterosexual couple, as same sex couples can adopt or can use medical advances (e. . IVF or surrogacy) to become a biological parent. (Edholm 1982 cited by Gittins p. 4) Anthropologists prefer to use the term kinship rather than family, \u201cthe ties which exist between individuals who are seen as related both through birth (descent) and through mating (marriage). \u201d This theory is concerned with the ways in which parentage us assigned, attributed and recognised, descent is traced, relatives are classified, rights are transferred across generations and groups are formed."
"An estimated 10 percent of children seen in primary care settings have symptoms of failure to thrive. The condition can appear in all socioeconomic groups, although it is seen more frequently in those families experiencing poverty. It is important to remember that some children will normally fall below the standards on growth charts. If children are full of energy, interacting normally with their parents, and show no signs of illness, then they are probably not failing to thrive and are just smaller children."
"Traumatic events from road accidents, natural disaster, serious illness, and violence or prolonged abuse. Traumatic events can put a toll on your physically body as well. Your body releases chemicals when it\u2019s under stress. Normally these Chemicals gives your body symptoms of raising blood pressure, increased heart rate, sweating and stomach activity (mental health foundation). Some people might experience shock and denial which can lead to Post traumatic stress disorder(ptsd). Post-traumatic stress disorder is a mental and emotional stress that occurs when you experience psychological shock. The symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder can be nightmares or flashbacks of the traumatic event, panic attacks sleep disturbance and poor concentration (mental health foundation)"
"Her father also owns the land, so they are not as poor as some black families; Cassie is protected by her family. The narration shows this by the way she questions Big Ma, as if that explained everything. \u201d Cassie does not realise that this does explain everything. It is only later that Cassie\u2019s mum explains. Big Ma sees the positive side to Strawberry. There is more room for them now than there would be in the summer. Big Ma also knows she has regular customers. Stacey has been to Strawberry before and he does as Big Ma says."
"When Eliot began to scream and shout at people, I focussed harder on the newspaper to ignore all the goings on in the carriage, despite it being a man, very depressed and alone, letting all his anger out. I played this character very upper-class, sitting up very straight on the chair, turning my nose up at the goings on in the train and acting very frustrated when I had to raise my newspaper that little bit higher to completely block out my surroundings. When I played the boss in the first \u2018real\u2019 flash back, I wasn\u2019t interested in Eliot\u2019s ideas, more so interested in the cup of tea I was soon to be enjoying."
"Animals and plants both synthesize fats and proteins from carbohydrates; thus\u00a0glucose is a basic energy source for all living organisms. The oxygen released (with water vapor, in transpiration) as a photosynthetic byproduct, principally of phytoplankton, provides most of the atmospheric oxygen vital to respiration in plants and animals, and animals in turn produce carbon dioxide necessary to plants."
"5 Lester B. Pearson worked hard to try to get Universal Health Care in Canada. He did it to help the citizens and create a better Canada as well. Being healthy is always a good thing for everyone. Some people did not approve of the idea at first, but it benefitted many citizens. When thinking about ways to help the citizens of Canada live better, healthier lives, Universal Health Care was a great way to make sure Canadians were all right and had support where they need it most. Every country wants a strong, stable economy. More new products being built expands businesses and creates new jobs, which means more money for the country and citizens. Prosperity is the goal. To obtain that goal, countries and leaders have to think of new ways to reach it."
"For instance, once an arranged marriage has been agreed to and the couple are engaged they can announce it and can therefore openly walk in the street holding hands and go to the cinema or such like unaccompanied without being gossiped about by Hindu society. They may not sleep together or mover in together before marriage though. This is because according to the Varna-ashrama-dharma sex is restricted to the householder stage of life and must not be performed in any of the other three stages of life."
"Even though most of these experiments are run on animals, the final test is usually run on a human for the exact results for humans. There have been cases where this human has had to face the side effects of the defective substance. I feel that testing it on humans is completely unethical. If it is immoral to test new drugs on animals, then it is totally wrong to test it on humans! If this ever happens, riots would engulf the streets. Now, that would not be a pretty sight. There are many people who are completely against this, without even thinking about the upside."
"While he was in medical school he noticed that he was read more books about Philosophy and Literature instead of learning about medicine. So, he gave up on medical school and went back home in 1903 to help take care of his sick mother who later died. Then he left home again, and then met a woman who later on became his wife. A few years later he moved back to Paris and was there with his family until World War II made them go back to Switzerland. In the mix of all of this, he found time to write a short story named Eveline."
"Other than that, the other benefit of friendship is improving our self-confidence. Friends will give spirit to overcome fear by face it head-on. From article by Dr.Irene S.L (2011), the friendship doctor, it is stated that friends can support our efforts to grow. Friends typically see strengths in us while the other people unable to recognize ourselves. Friends give us the encouragement and spirit to try something new or do something better. Albert Camus (1957) found, \u201cDo not walk behind me, I may not lead. Do not walk in front of me, I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend\u201d. As a friend, we must always beside our friend and supporting each other."
"For Lennie in particular it is to have responsibility for once, to look after the rabbits, and to finally have a sense of self worth. Yet the irony in Of Mice and Men is that the dream seems a mirage, it will not be achieved. George and Lennie try to deny their social class and role in the world, but the outcome will prove this dream to be unreachable. George and Lennie only own their arms and the friendship between them."
"Dr. Price is a role model to many people, and this is certain. Many look to his for guidance and help in many different areas. He has many friends and family who love him with all their heart. Dr. Price is a fine example of what hard work and determination will land you. Most people enter chemical engineering for the money or title, but he entered it for reasons beyond that. Dr. Price is a hero and role model, he is hard working, disciplined, and down to earth."
"In conclusion, respect really plays an important aspect in our lives, whether it is towards our family, friends or teachers. When we respect one another, there will be fewer conflicts and everybody will get along better. So, try to respect one another, who knows, maybe one day, people will learn to respect you too."
"The way I would visualize living there after I graduate is filled with grace and bountiful land. I\u2019d live in a multi family house with two or three other families in which I would habitually pray with the other families in church every morning. That small moment in praying and reflection of gratefulness would spark my day into an enriching day. I\u2019d help out sow in the field and plant various vegetables, tend to the cows and chickens and even learn how to use the tractor. I\u2019d consult with the director and my fellow members of Bethlehem Farm if something has gone awry or there\u2019s a pressing concern for something, like a sick animal or a shortage of tomatoes. Also, anytime I would need to visit the eye doctor or the dentist, it\u2019d be done with ease, since I\u2019m covered by Bethlehem Farm. For the most part, I would be ecstatic and jolly about living around the 47.5 acres farm with my fellow member and living each day with concerted effort and happiness through the grace of God. Under the current status that I live in, I\u2019m exposed to more volatility in terms of food safety and public safety. My current lifestyle is composed of rash decisions of everyday survival and enjoyment. The food that I consume on a daily basis and am surrounded by is primarily for convenience and gratification. Nuances of quality of food and style of living is far variant from the lifestyle I imagine living in Bethlehem Farm. The scenery and environment of New York City is predicated on financial gains and cravings of excitement. For example: the fast food restaurants, like Arby\u2019s, or McDonalds, food carts (halal), clubs, bars, pool halls etc. Not all these venues and eateries are inherently abject, but it doesn\u2019t promote a viable lifestyle in terms of health and virtuous living. The way the city is constructed is that money is the main impetus for people to work, so forms of greed and debauchery ensue from this. When there\u2019s a community, like Bethlehem Farm, there\u2019s a more serene and sensible way of experiencing life. There\u2019s no need for excessive materialism and accumulation of money in order to live a fulfilling and joyful life. The very basis lies in my religion of Catholicism, so living in such a community would aid in me attaining that ever elusive joy."
"One factor has to do with historical events and popular cultural. Sinha notes that one reason \u201cnurture\u201d theories became popular in the 1960s and 1970s was due to reaction against the horrific consequences of Nazi Germany\u2019s strict \u201cnature\u201d eugenics theories (p. 2). Then in the 1990s came a shift back to the \u201cnature\u201d theory, as new technology made it possible for scientists to identify more and more traits associated with genes."
"It\u2019s easy to think that wearing Halloween costumes helps express or show interest and imagination of people, especially kids, but when one looks at today\u2019s trends, many Americans are wearing sexually inappropriate costumes on Halloween. For instance, \u201c people generally choose costumes that help to explore a different or alternative side of their personality\u201d or life (Psychology: What does your Halloween costume say about you?). Halloween costumes are chosen to match people\u2019s desires. But how far can someone\u2019s desires go in order to cross the lines?. On Halloween, you should encounter ghosts, goblins, monsters, princesses, and heroes. However this Halloween, you would encounter mostly females wearing little to barely any clothing as a costume. Does sexy even sound like Halloween to you? For one, it\u2019s scary! I have to admit, I always feel uneasy whenever I see someone with very little clothing on them. When I was little I wondered why people wore costumes like that instead of the Disney Princess costumes all the girls were wearing. Whenever I went costumes shopping the adult aisle was filled with mostly sexually themed costumes, making shopping very hard. Moreover, Sarah Seltzer, a journalist for The New York Times writes, \u201cHalloween allows women to abandon all pretenses at beauty by becoming literally monstrous, or alternately to reach campy skin-bearing heights that would normally be frowned-upon (Watch Out For Exploitative Halloween Costumes). This unwanted attention puts females in danger and leaves kids with a bad image in their heads."
"Forming a revised self-concept in keeping with the more mature behavior. 3. Coping with the conflicting demands that will be involved in behavior modification. 4. Being motivated to complete the developmental task. ?A developmental task may be as something which has to be accomplished at a certain time, if its not done difficulties may arise in the future. ?Sometimes tasks of individual family members and family units are equally compatible. But there maybe occasions when life cycle and family tasks may not be compatible, and this situation could cause stress within the family unit."
"In conclusion, according to research, fear has many good effects. It can help children learn about themselves while they confront and defeat their fears, and they become stronger and more resilient as a result. They can also learn many social lessons, such as how family is important to who you are as well as appearances should not always be trusted, and that they should be more cautious sometimes. Finally, they can be happier as a result of this, as they will have less to fear and worry about, as they will know how to deal with those fears. So, horror indeed has many benefits for teens in the Junior High age group, and I would recommend that they are allowed to experience horror stories for themselves, reading books if it is less scary for them."
"When an unexpected pregnancy happens, the mother can do things to harm the baby because she might not know she is pregnant which is a risk to the child\u2019s health. Mothers that are younger can have the consequences of not being able to finish school due to unintended pregnancies. When abortion laws are put on top of an unintended pregnancy, it can make it more complicated for the woman and her wellbeing.Kacanek, Deborah; Dennis, Amanda; Miller, Kate; Blanchard, Kelly. \u201c Medicaid Funding for Abortion: Providers\u2019 Experiences with Cases Involving Rape, Incest, and Life Endangerment\u201d National Institute of Justice, vol.42, no.2, 2010, pp.317-390, Print. In this article, the argument is that medical providers don\u2019t want to reimburse victims of rape, incest, and life endangerment and the consequences it has on women. Some Medicaid funding does not cover the expenses of the abortion procedures. \u201c\u2026 states in which Medicaid funding is limited to cases of rape, incest, and life endangerment: Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Wyoming\u201d. Abortion procedures tend to cost a good amount of one\u2019s money. More money is spent if the abortion clinic is miles away or in another state where women have to buy hotel rooms to get their procedure done. For example, \u201cThe median costs were $450 for a medication abortion, $425 for a first-trimester surgical abortion, and $900 for a second-trimester abortion, but costs varied considerably\u201d."
"You can tell they love what they do. Although, most people wonder why one person would want to spend the rest of their life working in people\u2019s mouths, I think of it so much more than that. It is such a neat feeling knowing you can wake up excited to do what you have dreamed about your whole life."
"In conclusion, respect really plays an important aspect in our lives, whether it is towards our family, friends or teachers. When we respect one another, there will be fewer conflicts and everybody will get along better. So, try to respect one another, who knows, maybe one day, people will learn to respect you too."
"Gun control has been a controversial issue in the United States, and nobody seems to have a solution. America has been experiencing numerous shootings and indiscriminate firing incidents in schools, malls, and churches. Most gun owners think that gun control is not a good option. However, laws that make gun ownership of any type to fall into the wrong hands. Therefore, regulating gun control laws could save peoples\u2019 lives; the State laws will reduce mass shootings, and it will restrict the person who purchases it."
"The poet repeats the image of his mother \u2018lying in the wet clay\u2019 in the final stanza. This is because he knows that she is \u2018lying in the wet clay\u2019 but he doesn\u2019t want to think of her in that way. The memories that the poet has of his mother are all very pleasant, and the poem shows that they had a loving and caring relationship."
"Planning is done by observing the child and following the child\u2019s interest but we also need to tailor the activity to them and consider what\u00a0communication and language skills they have and will they be able to carry out the activity or do I need to have pictures for the child to point to instead of them using their words. This way I can see their understanding and we can build on their speech at the same time. We also need to remember the size of the group if the group is to big this will mean some children will struggle to pay attention and listen to what is being said and understand what is required from them. If it is too noisy is the child being distracted by the other children or staff? The key is to take every single child as an individual, have good communication with their parent and carer and learn their interests and likes as soon as possible."
"The Height of Bad Manners is Way too Much. To begin with, Bad Manners is defined by lack of polite or well-bred social behavior resulting by ignorance, this may be true, but I don\u00b4t think so, this is because nowadays people are adopting this reprehensive conducts no just by ignorance, but for doing whatever they want, in this bad manner conducts we can see: not respecting adults, farting in front of anybody, not saluting, people that don\u00b4t respect the third age privileges in public places/transport."
"Past research shows that self esteem, extreme jealousy, difficulties in regulating anger, and also strong emotion, when a dominant man feels inferior from their partner from an educational socioeconomic standpoint, some of these men with very strong and traditional beliefs may think that they have the right to control the women, and that women are not equal to men. That dominate behavior takes the form of emotional, sexual and physical abuse, studies show that violent behavior often is caused by an interaction of situational and individual factors, meaning that abusers learn abusive behaviors from their family members people they trust people they love, more so whom they look up to."
"The flexibleness of the younger kids penchants allows for the creative activity of upgraded tailored playthings and games that older kids are more attracted to buy consequently. Therefore. the trade name of Sony and Playstation developed different demographic age groups to market that will equilibrate out the disparity of clip periods of low birth rate to a higher older kids population. The demand for a different gambling experience by the older demographics sets the saloon for houses both in the U. K. and the United States that creates a platform for act uponing the selling and design scheme ( Burnes. 2004:102 ) ."
"This illustrates how Slim does have a bad side which known wants to get on the bad side with. This idea that no one\u2019s what he can do implies that Slim is capable of great violence. This is shown when he \u201cdrowned four of em right off.\u201d This is because his \u201cbitch\u201d could not feed them which shows that he will only do violence if it is necessary and so for the better not the worse, this emphasizes his overwhelming power Slim has. Slim\u2019s position in the hierarchy is high because he is able to make Curley stop what he is doing. This shows his assertiveness when he says, \u201cyou lay offa me.\u201d This implies that due to the hierarchy and Curley\u2019s fear of Slim, he is prepared to do what Slim tells him to. However when Lennie is getting beaten up by Curley, it shows how Slim is very peaceful but at the same time threatening and always looking out for people who are not in the wrong. This is shown when \u201cSlim jumped up,\u201d this shows how Slim is protective over Lenny which makes the reader feels sympathetic towards Lennie. On the other hand his aggression is shown when says, \u201cget um myself.\u201d"
"The electric chair was an invention by Harold P. Brown who was an employee of Thomas Edison, the sole purpose was to investigate the uses of electricity in executions. The chair was first adopted in 1889 and the first execution took place in 1890 in New York. In execution by electric chair, the prisoner is strapped to the chair with metal straps and a wet sponge is placed in his head to aid conductivity. Electrodes are placed on the head and legs to create a closed circuit. Depending on the physical state of the prisoner, two currents of varying level and duration are applied. This is generally 2,000 volts for 15 seconds for the first current to cause unconsciousness and to stop the heart."
"The Europeans were attracted to the area primarily for economic gain. Some came as explorers, others as miners and eventually the settlers arrived. The Great Northern Railway reached Montana in 1891 and from thence great number of people flocked to the area attracted by prospects of mining and other economic activities [26] . Around the turn of the century, people began to look at Montana region as an area that was suitable for something more than farming or mining. They recognized that the area was exceptionally beautiful in reference to the landscape. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, influential leader led by George Grill began pushing for the establishment of a national park. Their desire was granted in 1910 when President Taft signed into law the bill establishing Glacier as the 10th national park [27] . But why is this significant in terms of your argument?"
"The book follows the stories of three refugee children in three different places and Difference time. Each child experiences Terrible loss and personal victories as they try to escape their homelands. Josef Landau is fleeing Nazi Germany in 1939. Isabel Fernandez is escaping Castro\u2019s Cuba in 1994. Mahmoud Bishara is leaving Syria during the volatile regime of Bashar al-Assad in 2015."

"The findings of this research shows that children are mostly exposed to advertisements with animated characters. The animation market has changed a lot since 1994 therefore the animation used nowadays in television advertising differs in technique but also the characters have changed. \u2018\u2019Branded characters which are media characters that are associated with a company, and hence promote its brand name, appeal to children and youth\u2019\u2019 (Calvert, 2008). Companies have been using these branded characters by licensing to help selling a product of that company."
"Although there is very little research specifically on the impact of migrants\u2019 fiscal contribution in Birmingham, its impact on the national level is found to be small and differ by migrant group, for example, EEA migrants and non-EEA migrants, recent migrants and all migrants, etc. However, the fiscal impact of migrants has been estimated more or less than 1 per cent of the UK\u2019s GDP. The net fiscal contribution of EEA migrants in the fiscal year 2017/2018 was estimated at 4.7 billion pounds, compared to a net cost of 9 billion pounds for non-EEA migrants (Oxford_Economics, 2018). The negative net fiscal contribution of non-EEA migrants was primarily due to higher spending of children since non-EEA migrants are currently more likely to have dependent children than the UK born and receive more in family benefits and tax credits."
"This film was released to illustrate the reality or the outcomes of racial prejudice in the society. The story took place in the bustling city of Los Angeles. The major theme of this movie is about the result of racial stereotyping in the society particularly in America. Ever since people know that there is a gap or tension that exists between Whites and Blacks. Additional to these, there are also racial issues between other races like Hispanics and Asians."
"Most arguments concerning the abortion issue hinge on the moral status or standing of the fetus with respect to the rights it possesses and the obligations that are directly owed to it. These arguments typically fall into two commonly termed categories: pro-life and pro-choice. Pro-life advocates tend to place the status of the fetus first. They argue human beings including a fetus, have an intrinsic value that confers them the right not to be unjustly killed. Conversely, some pro-choice advocates argue the fetus lacks a virtuous characteristic that affords it any rights or significant morals, this is usually termed the \u2018personhood\u2019 argument."
"In this second sense, cultural identity is viewed as an issue of both \u201cbecoming\u201d and \u201cbeing\u201d, something that belongs to the future as much as it belongs to the past. Cultural identities in this regard have histories and therefore changes constantly. In other words, cultural identities are subject to the uninterrupted play of history, culture and power (Hall, 1997a). Identity is the name given to the different ways we are placed, and put ourselves within the tale of the past."
"There are many variables involved in the epidemic of childhood obesity that Critser does not recognize, for example the diseases or genetics that are involved with obesity. The feasible solution Critser argues might help in the short run with a decrease in childhood obesity, but in the long run his solution will not solve the overall epidemic to end childhood obesity. To begin with, Critser never mentions the discriminating effects and rude treatment that obese people deal with the minute they step out in society."
"I have never been in any sort of trouble before. Not at home, not at school, and especially not legally. I do not know why I did what I did, I still have no excuse for my actions other than complete stupidity and disrespect. I now know how much effect my actions have on myself, my mom, my friends, the neighborhood and the world."
"What\u2019s the meaning of happiness? Mankind will probably never know. Yes, there are theories. Yes there are many assumptions but it is almost impossible to know. And when or even if optimism isn\u2019t needed anymore what will we do? You never know what you\u2019re going to do in a situation until you\u2019re in it. What if there was a world where optimism was unnecessary. Is that even possible?"
"I feel as people are grown enough to understand what they doing, I think if you give them another chance the criminal would learn they lesson. Mistakes are made in-laws also, what if someone is killed who is actually innocent? Mistakes can be made, I feel as if you do a crime that gives you life in jail like killing, kidnap, robbery, or rape they should be killed."

"Many will argue that Canada would be better off without its lenient attitude towards immigration and multiculturalism. There are several negative factors that are attributed to Canada\u2019s multicultural policy. One of the main reasons why people believe that Canada\u2019s multicultural policy does more harm\u00a0than good is because it creates racism. By putting many different races together, all of which have different cultural and value differences, acts of discrimination and racism are bound to occur. Also, some immigrants bring with them histories of conflict in their home countries to Canada, which leads to\u00a0problems that could include violence, hatred, and discrimination (Bibby, 1990). Rather than unite Canadians, these factors would only divide Canadian society."
"Poverty reduction, or poverty alleviation, has been largely as a result of overall economic growth. The dawn of industrial revolution led to high economic growth, eliminating mass poverty in what is now considered the developed world. In 1820, 75% of humanity lived on less than Rs 50 a day, while in 2001, only about 20% do."
"The rights of animals have always been important to me during my life. This is due to the fact that I have had pets for as long as I remember. On this topic I feel as though having domesticated animals in the home is fine as long as proper care is taken of them."
"\u2022 \u201cAmong School Children\u201d was written after visiting a Montessori school in Dublin. A sixty-year-old man, a famous poet and a winner of the Nobel Prize, Yeats was asked to visit such institutions to provide encouragement to students. Segment 2: Three Greek Philosophers (6:00) ________________________________________ \u2022 Yeats points to three different constructions of the world: \u2022 Platonic forms: where nature is only a transient phenomenon.

"The French were Okies, the Italians in suits were Okies. When I asked about the Jews, whom I had read about she asked for a picture. I rode home on my bicycle and returned with a calendar depicting the important races of the world. \u201cPues si, son Okies tambien! \u201d (page 696) I also found Gary\u2019s Soto\u2019s grandmother amusing because she would ridiculously lump people together. This however is easier than trying to recognize each and every different ethnic group that exist on the face of the earth, but it is our differences that often make us so unique."
"The European obtained these through the subjugation of Autochthonal people ( The Social. Cultural and Historical Context of Aboriginal and torres Strait Islander Australians ) . The differences between the manner of life of the Whites and the Aborigines are immense. The Europeans frequently thought of the Autochthonal people as barbarians and wished to extinguish their traditional and barbarous ways. In order to make so. they Australian Government issued the Forced Assimilation Policy in 1869. This policy ensured that Aboriginal kids were consistently removed from their households. and placed with white households."
"Using a natural setting for observation, and longitudinal study can show researchers that social factors and environmental factors can influence identity formation. Overall social media, celebrity shows, and environmental factors have a heavy impact on our lives each day. Many young girls and boys try to find their own medium with all these barriers to overcome with trying to fit in at school or watching TV shows that show unrealistic behaviors and appearances for the real world. \u201cTeenaged adolescents watch more movies than any other segment of the population."
"\u201d large, matriarchal extended families living in a run down and overcrowded accommodation, that it would be based in a small enclosed community, thereby providing a considerable potential for conflict, intrigue and gossip, and that it would make a great play of Cockney humour. \u201d (15) The Slaters family is good example of this in Eastenders. Granada television produces Coronation Street, which first appeared in 1960 and through this soap it also established its own regional identity and satisfied viewers assumptions."
"Furthermore, with every job, there are employment guidelines and rules that have to be followed. Police Misconduct can be defined as any action performed by a police officer that is unethical by established employment guidelines. In several cases, victims of traffic stop or arrests of those of color, in some way have been tortured, whether it was from a shot, tazer, or physically beaten. Compared to cases of white people in which many individuals have died due to terrorist like attacks such as school shooting, have walked into custody injury free. Many police officers are not held accountable for their actions and have easily gotten away with abuse of power against people of color even evidence from either the dash camera itself from the police car or from standbys recording on their cellular devices. Police misconduct violates rights and causes people to be wrongfully accused of crimes or even potentially death and can lead to obstruction of justice."
"Another factor that influences the stereotyping is the influence of others. Sometimes, we are confused between other\u2019s perceptions and ours which it may vary a lot. As a result, we might choose to follow their perception and slowly believe that our thinking is wrong and erroneous. This may happen in everyone\u2019s life especially children where they tend to follow others more than their own instinct."
"He\u2019s concerened that she will never get married or even have sex. Carmen enjoys cooking like her father but does not feel that he likes her dishes. Like any daughter, she subconciously seeks his approval especially as their passions are aligned.

"\u201cDream Job\u201d is one of the main focus in almost everyone life that seeking for success in their future. But who could of thought searching was one of the main key players in the search of pursuing the dream career. As we are living in a country with the most advance in the technology, where people able to search and look for their dream career through online search engine with no limited on the information that they can find. But the only concern was which search engine out there in the world wide web that have the capable to narrow down in giving the most up to date and right information that the searchers needed for their career search."
"\u201cThe Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) is a law in the United States of America that pertains to the policies and regulations regarding employment. This law was enacted in 1986 for various reasons, which includes the fact that many illegal employees work in the United States. The two main requirements of the IRCA include: \u201c(1) to hire only persons authorized to work in the United States and (2) to not discriminate on the basis of citizenship status or national origin\u201d (LMD 1992). For any company to hire a person, they must complete an I-9 form and prove accurate authorization to work in the United States. This can be a passport, a work permit and or Social Security card. I support this immigration reform and have hope the United States can help those in need so they can be done in the right way. This will not be an easy task to define, but I will always have faith our United States system will be fair. Whether a class be required to obtain a work permit or become a United States citizen for a Social Security card, this can help both sides of the spectrum to keep an organized way of allowing jobs to be fulfilled by immigrants coming to seek a better life."
"Elsie Norris however, seems to be someone whom Jeanette admits that she \u2018likes very much\u2019. Elsie is an interest to Jeanette because in a sense she is rather different to Pastor Spratt who seems to be very hooked with Mrs Winterson\u2019s work, her father who doesn\u2019t even have a role yet in the novel. Elsie Norris provides Jeanette things that Jeanette finds a sentiment in, which are very different to the things found in her home. In her home she would be likely to find stacks of biblical books, and church hymns whereas in Elsie\u2019s home there is things like an organ which they play on, foreign coins and \u2018best of all she had a collage of Noah\u2019s ark\u2019"
"Nowadays, it is common to see people from diverse background living together in a single territory. Some societies are even lenient in allowing the existence of diversity which could be termed as multiculturalism. Multiculturalism is identified as the co-existence of different cultures in a single bounded territory where in the small group of people of diverse background have the right to practice things that are different from the dominant population and are still accepted as an important part of a whole (Kennedy-Dubourdieu, 2006, p."
"More so, Healey (2006) pontificates that the scapegoating theory targets for the displaced aggression vary, for example failure by the government of Zimbabwe to run the economy that led to hyper-inflationary epoch many Zimbabweans blamed the sanctions for the economic turmoil and the Europeans as the oppressors but were there to blame for economic crisis in actual sense and this poses a question to many people ."
"Teresa Lewis was put to death in Virginia on Thursday for arranging the killings of her husband and a stepson over a $250,000 insurance payment. The 41-year-old was the first woman to be executed in the United States in five years. Texas held the most recent U.S. execution of a woman in 2005. Out of more than 1,200 people put to death since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, only 11 have been women."
"There is much to consider when looking at the advantages and disadvantages to the three frameworks of public assistance, social insurance, and citizenship in the United States and the ways in which education plays a role within each. Without access to education, children suffer from a young age and are faced with a variety of problems later on in life. Children fail to make progress in social, emotional, physical, and cognitive development without the opportunity to grow in an enriching and stimulating environment. Education, especially early education, is the foundation for academic learning and children who are denied access are less likely to graduate from high school, go to college, or land higher-paying jobs. It is vital to provide our youth with a fair chance to succeed and ultimately become productive members of society."
"they have successfully pointed out the innocence in some convicts with the aid of post conviction DNA tests (Aronson & Simon, 2009). Arguments in Favor of Death Penalty On the other hand, the death penalty is considered as an eye for an eye and that all convicted killers should be executed in order to attain evenness. The most horrible felony warrants no less than the most horrible sentence, which should mean an eye for an eye. As such, the victim\u2019s family should feel that the offender was given the most intense judgment other than just being locked up in a prison and keep enjoying their life."

At the beginning, however, George admits to Slim that he had done something bad to Lennie and in this case Lennie forgives him. Throughout any relationship there are bound to be ups and downs and George and Lennie maintain a healthy friendship by forgiveness. Steinbeck gave George\u2019s character quite a big heart because he may complain about his misfortunes whilst staying with Lennie but he never leaves Lennie\u2019s side."
"Perhaps she used the romance magazines as an escape from her abusive father while her mother turned a blind eye. Then the marriages began. At the age of Nannie Doss wed a man she had only known for four months. Charley Braggs and Doss had four children together from 1921 to 1927. The marriage fell apart at that point. The happy couple lived with Bragg\u2019s mother, but she had the same abusive type of behavior as Doss\u2019 father. Perhaps it was her mother-in-law that kick started Doss\u2019 murdering spree. Two children died under mysterious circumstances that same year. One moment the kids were perfectly healthy, and then suddenly they died without an apparent cause. Two children died under mysterious circumstances that same year. One moment the kids were perfectly healthy, and then suddenly they died without an apparent cause. The couple divorced in 1928. Braggs took his older daughter, Melvin, with him and left a newborn, Florine, with his ex-wife and mother. Just a year after her divorce, Doss married her second husband. He was an abusive alcoholic from Jacksonville, Fla. named Frank Harrelson. The two met through a lonely hearts column. Harrelson wrote her romantic letters, while Doss responded with racy letters and photos. Despite the abuse, the marriage lasted 16 years until 1945. During this period, Doss likely killed her own newborn granddaughter a few days after the birth by using a hairpin to stab her in the brain. A few months after the granddaughter\u2019s death, her two-year-old grandson, Robert, died of asphyxiation while in Doss care. These two kids belonged to Melvin, Doss\u2019 older child with Braggs. Doss married her second husband he was an abusive alcoholic from Jacksonville, Fla. Named Frank Harrelson. The two met through a lonely hearts column. Harrelson work her romantic letters, while Doss responded with racy letters and photos. Despite the abuse, the marriage lasted 16 years until 1945.

Her two year old grandson, Robert, died of asphyxiation while in Doss\u2019 care. These two kids belonged to Melvin, Doss\u2019 older child with Briggs. Harrelson was next on the murder list. Following a night of drunken revelry at the end of World War II, Doss mixed a secret ingredient into his hidden jar of Moonshine. He was dead less than week later on Sept 15, 1945. People assumed he died of food poisoning. Meanwhile, Doss collected enough life insurance money from Harrelson\u2019s death to buy a plot of land and a house near Jacksonville. Arlie Lanning of Lexington, N.C. died in 1952 several years after he responded to a lonely hearts classified ad placed by Doss. Playing the doting wife, Doss agreed to take care of her. Shortly thereafter. He was a heavy drinker, so doctors attributed the heart attack to alcohol. Richard Morton of Emporia, Kan. Was Doss\u2019 next true love, although he spent a lot of time with other women while married to Doss. However, Doss wouldn\u2019t discover this just yet, because she was distracted with other matters. Doss\u2019 mother needed a caretaker after she fell and broke a hip in 1953 after her father passed away. The women died suddenly and without warning a few months after Doss agreed to take care of her. Shortly after her mother\u2019s death, one of Doss\u2019s sisters died suddenly after having contact with the Nannie Doss. Nannie Doss\u2019 final victim was Samuel Doss of Tulsa, Okla. He was neither a drunk nor abusive He simply made the mistake of telling his wife that she could only read magazines or watch television shows that were for educational purposes. Nannie Doss was a serial killer who earned the monikers The Giggling Nanny, and The Jolly Black Widow after going on a killing spree that begin in the 1920s and ended in 1954. Doss was easy to entertain. Her favorite pastimes included reading romance novels and poisoning members of her family to death. Childhood years Nannie Doss was born Nancy Hazel on Nov 4, 1905, in Blue Mountain, Alabama, to James and Lou Hazel. Much of Doss childhood was spent avoiding the wrath of her father who ruled the family with an abusive iron fist. If they were needed to work on the farm, James Hazel on Nov 4, 1905, in Blue Mountain, Alabama, to James and Lou Hazel. Much of Doss\u2019 childhood was spent avoiding the wrath of her father who ruled the family with an abusive iron fist. With education being a low priority in the Hazel family, there were no objections when Nannie decided to leave school for good after completing the sixth grade. When Nannie was 7 years old, she was on a train that suddenly stopped, causing her to fall forward and hit her head. After the incident, she suffered for years with migraine headaches, blackouts, and depression. From early on James Hazel refused to allow his daughter to do anything to enhance their appearance. Pretty dresses and makeup were not allowed nor were friendship with the boys. It was not until does got her first job in 1921 that she had any real social interaction with the opposite sex. At the age of 16, instead of attending school and worrying about prom night, Doss was working in a linen factory and spending her spare time with her head buried in her favorite pastime, reading romance magazines, especially the lonely hearts club section. While working at the factory Doss met Charley Braggs who worked at the same factory and took care of his unmarried mother. The two began dating and within five months they were married and doss moved in with Braggs and his mother. If she hoped by marrying was to escape the oppressive environment she grew up in, she must have been disappointed. Her mother in law turned out to be extremely controlling and manipulative. Motherhood The Briggs had first child in 1923 and three more followed over the next three years. Doss life had become prison of raising children, taking care of her demanding mother in law, and putting up with Nannie Doss was an American serial killer who was convicted and sentenced to life in prison after murdering 11 people between the 1920s and 1954.

Her own mother; Davie Frances Hazel Weaver, her sister; and Robert Lee Haynes, her grandson. She married a second time in 1929 to Robert Franklin. Harrelson, who later became her first confirmed victim. The happy couple lived with Bragg\u2019s mother, but she had the same abusive type of behavior. People assumed he did of food poisoning. If they were needed to work on the farm, James Hazel gave little thought to pulling the children out of school. The early 1950s were a lethal time for Nanny\u2019s relatives. Her third husband, Arlie Lanning, died at Lexington, North Carolina, in 1952. A few months later, in January 1953, her mother died while Nanny nursed the woman for a broken hip. Two of her sisters died the same year, in different towns; each collapsed while Nanny was visiting, each with the same mysterious symptoms of stomach cramps and convulsions. In 1953, it was husband number four \u2014 Richard Morton \u2014 laid to rest at Emporia, Kansas. She had an unhappy childhood. She was a poor student who never learned to read well; her education was erratic because her father forced his children to work on the family farm instead of attending school. When she was around seven years old, the family was taking a train to visit relatives in southern Alabama; when the train stopped suddenly, Nannie hit her head on the metal bar on the seat in front of her. For years after, she suffered severe headaches, blackouts and depression; she blamed these and her mental instability on that accident. He was the only son of his unmarried mother, who insisted on living with them. Doss later wrote. Was one of the many people who celebrated rather robustly? After an evening of particularly heavy drinking, he raped Doss. To cope, she began drinking at night and managed to get out to local bars for her own adulterous fun. Their marriage was doomed."
"Their identity has demolished and their names mean nothing in the community, they are simply recognized as Japs-the enemy. Moreover, along the same lines of showcasing a loss of identity ties into how the characters are stripped of the things they love and enjoy. In the opening of the novel we realize the family is leaving, although we do not know exactly where they are headed, we realize they have to leave everything behind that they cannot fit in their duffle bags. Among the things to be left behind are the animals as well. Like most individuals with animals, pets are considered part of the family. It is clear that White Dog is a part of the family, and has been for quite a while now. The boys concern when he cannot find White Dog works to show the connection they have, for it is apparent it is routine that he checks on the dog each day after school. Likewise the characters, like many of those who endured internment camps, continue to lose the very things they once cherished. In Justin Ewer\u2019s \u201cJourney Into a Dark Past\u201d 15 year old Betty Abe says, \u201cSome whites swooped down on Japanese communities looking for bargains. Cars, silverware, furniture-all were gobbled up for a fraction of their value (Ewers, 3).\u201d"
"Likewise, the conventional way of obtrusively gathering information also takes place. Instances of stolen wallet or purse are not uncommon (Identity Theft: How it Happens, 2000). \u201cThe thief either uses the information obtained or provides the contents to a crime ring\u201d (Identity Theft: How it Happens, 2000). Also, devices like laptops and other portable equipments are taken to acquire vital information that will help an identity thief accomplish his desires (Combating Identity Theft, 2007). Similarly, electronic pilfering of important files occurs. Hackers"
"New types of stone tools appeared in various parts of the Philippines, more polished and highly specialized, primarily blade and ax- and adz- like forms for forest clearing and boat making. The smooth surface of this type of stone tools was made possible by rubbing against another stone. This development resulted to the so-called New Stone Age or Neolithic Period."
"Equally important, the idea on which this whole proposal is based on Trump is also recognized which is that no matter what, his supporters will still support and promote Trump\u2019s proposal hiding their racial based idealisms. In a special article by BBC News, the following statement is given by Julio Ricardo Varela and says \u2018Trump\u2019s border wall was never just about security, it\u2019s meant to remind all Latinos that we\u2019re unwelcome\u2019 (Rodgers and Bailey). This has been causing a controversial thought that has been around since Trump made the proposal, as he tends to make racist based comments when he references the wall. Trump makes accusations and blames the whole group of people without giving them the reason to make themselves known and demonstrate how they really are. Because Trump is selfish and really has a certain hatred towards migrants and any kind of people of this descent."
"His sentiments are similar to those expressed by Steve. At the same time Stoney is of the opinion that education isn\u2019t always a guarantee of financial success \u201c When I was nineteen , working at Carlucci\u2019s and making a decent paycheck for a kid , I got a waitress that\u2019s standing over there that just did six years in college but she\u2019s making twenty bucks less a week than I am. It\u2019s like four years of college doesn\u2019t get you shit anymore\u201d (323). Toward the end of this chapter McLeod poses the question \u201c\u0301To what extents are they, they individuals responsible for what happens to them and to what extent is it the society and the opportunities available to them\u201d? Slick believes that you can only blame society to a certain extent he adds that it is up to the individual to take responsibility for themselves However , at the same time he seems to blame society when he speaks about the universities in the area where he grew up , he states \u201c They\u2019ll take interest in the people that got money . But those motherfuckers don\u2019t need the help. It\u2019s those people that are poor that need help\u201d (348)."
"Developing a computational theoretical account of face acknowledgment is rather hard, because faces are complex, multidimensional and meaningful ocular stimulation. They are a natural category of objects and stand in stark contrast to sine wave grates [ 8 ] . Face acknowledgment research has increased in last a decennary because of its application demand such as designation for jurisprudence enforcement and hallmark for entree in security channel such as bank, insurance, fiscal organisation and authorities service [ 9 ] . One of the universe renowned face acknowledgment techniques is eigenface."
"Completing spellings enables children and young people to develop their writing skills and their vocabulary as they may know how to spell a word without maybe knowing that it is a word. Key skills effects young people\u2019s lives because it teaches them six different skills to help them apply for college courses and gain a further education to get a job that they want. Doing all of these things is improving their speech, language and communication needs and also their vocabulary. 3. 3 \u2013 Apply research evidence to planning an environment that supports speech, language and communication"
"Stereotypes are formed when the characteristics of a certain group of people are based on the generalized characteristics of a few. They are most often used to simplify that which we have difficulty understanding, in order to make it more predictable. As W.I. Thomas taught, what we believe to be true will be true in its consequences. Throughout history racial stereotypes have always existed. Perhaps, though, the most dominant stereotypes have been placed against African-Americans. They have been thought of as uneducated, immature, unmotivated, criminal, violent and sexual predators. However, as Griffin points out, the sins the whites commit are the same as the blacks. Except for the fact that blacks are deprived of the \u201cpleasures of the spirits\u201d. They feel like a lesser person so in order to acquire that feeling of accomplishment and manhood they engage in such activities ."
"The people of the United States are living in terrible firearm conditions where they experience anxiety about going to places nearby out of fear of getting attacked by somebody with a gun, and the number of innocent people dying because of a firearm is increasing and has left families devastated. Though many may like to argue against gun control by saying it is vital to protecting people from home invasions or other life threatening events, the research shows that not only are guns statistically not not used as self defense but there also are many alternative weapons that have been proven more effective. Overall the United States is in desperate need for gun control that takes away the right to bear arms from all U.S Citizens. Repealing the Second Amendment is the solution the United States needs, and is justified because the Second Amendment no longer reflects gun conditions in the United States. Times have changed and our legal system needs to reflect that change."
"Other major issues affecting our society and on these games and shows is racial, gender, and sexual stereotypes. Illegal crimes and criminal behavior are seen almost every day by children in America. These crimes are seen on things such as the news, the Internet, television shows, magazines, and video games. Children are also beginning to speak foul language and use impolite gestures without even realizing it (Video Games and Children: Playing with Violence)."
"\u201c\u2026lying down the floor of the closet, applied my ear to the hole, and found, to my great joy, I could distinctly hear the conversation that was passing below\u2026The council prolonged their discussion for some hours; but I remained motionless and silent until the proceedings were brought to a conclusion, at one o\u2019clock in the morning. As soon as the coast was clear I crossed the courtyard, and made the best of my way to my own room, and took down in cypher everything, I had heard which seemed to me of any importance\u2026\u201d"
"We should respect and support a woman and her family as they face the life-altering decision of whether to have a child. It is neither my place nor our government\u2019s place to make such an important life decision for someone else -Louise Melling. (Louise)\u201d. If one is not ready for a child due to whatever the issue may be, why make a child suffer? As we, all know this world isn\u2019t easy to survive in, its hard and it would be even harder with a child that a women cannot bear to take care of."
"The Connexions service was established in 2001 with the aim of providing a comprehensive service to meet young people\u2019s needs for information, advice and support. Through multi-agency working, in conjunction with the CAF, Connexions provides high quality, impartial information, advice and guidance ( including careers advice), together with access to personal development opportunites to help remove barriers to learning and progression and ensure young people make a smooth transition to adulthood and working life."
"To be in love with a man who is going no where is life and that is lame, also shows that Sarah is doomed and will never gain success in life. The importance of Friel making the reader aware of the different relations that a character has is essential in the understanding of the character. It can show them to be weak or strong and determines part of the character. Stage directions are also extremely valuable to forming a judgement of a character as their physical appearance and values that may not come across in dialogue are emphasised and therefore the reader has a greater understanding of the character."
"Brantlinger\u2019s paper discusses the different views on colonisation by explaining five differents stances taken. According to Brantlinger the abolitionist stance (despite its good intentions) pitied the Africans and tried to fight for the Africans, but at the same time it did not occur to them that Africans were also intelligent people who could fight their own battles. It was hence seen that the abolitionists too, were treating the\u00a0Africans as inferior. His discussion of the explorer\u2019s stance illustrates how the explorers exploited Africa and destroyed its people because the explorers saw the Africans as a sub-race of savages who had little to no importance. Brantlinger also shows how scientists saw the Africans as a separate species to humans and that Africans were thought to be animals. Scientists theorised, through Social Darwinism, that the Africans would either have to survive of sucumb. To them the Africans were expendable."
"James Joyce\u2019s inspiration for writing came from experiences with his family and the town in which he lived. For example, Joyce\u2019s father was a highly regarded tenor singer in Ireland due to that there was no steady income for the family upkeep. In addition, his father was also an alcoholic so Joyce grew up poor. He depicts this aspect of his childhood in the text when the narrator\u2019s uncle comes home late and drunk even after being pre-informed of the narrator\u2019s desire to go to the bazaar."
"As Beauport declined his offer and made the jump into the conclusion without taking any advantages or any consideration regarding Gilman\u2019s offer. Beauport has a stereotype toward the market research coordinator, that this department is only a backroom job. She is not considered the chances to enhance her career in this company as Mr. Gilman has worked as the marketing research coordinator for several years earlier to obtain more experiences before he became the vice president of marketing in Hy Dairies."
"Identity answers the question, \u201cWho am I?\u201d. Made up of our characteristics, such as self-conception, identity defines who we are within a larger group. This idea of identity is explored throughout Toni Morrison\u2019s Beloved. The story follows a former slave named Sethe and her family during the post-slavery era. Through the story of Beloved and the use of Gothic elements such as isolation, the supernatural, and the oppression of women, Morrison explores the theme of the loss of identity as a result of trauma, and how one can claim it through the community."
"Helene and Nel Wright has a lack of communication in their relationship, pushing Nel away from her mother and looking towards Sula, a new role model for her to follow. The novel Sula by Toni Morrison, shows the relationships between various mother\u2019s and their children, leaving readers with the sense that the kids are deeply affected by their mother\u2019s participation in their lives and how much communication goes on between the two."
"This shatters Candy\u2019s dreams because he cannot share his dream with his long companion. In Chapter 4, Crooks is introduced. He is the only coloured (black) person on the ranch and this is where the theme of loneliness comes into play. Crooks is a stable buck. He has a crooked spine, and his eyes lay deep in his head, he is lined with deep black wrinkles and has thin tightened lips. Again relating to the theme of loneliness, Crooks lives by himself in a shed because he is the only Black man, this is why he can afford to leave all of his belongings lying around. He has got his own collection of items like books, shoes and his own copy for the California civil code which indicates that he knows his rights and does not want to be taken advantage of. Eventually Crooks and Lennie are talking about if Lennie could live without George and about crook\u2019s childhood explaining why his father never let him play with other kids and why he is so lonely."
"Now it is reversing and it is getting warmer, but eventually the temperature will even out and be back to normal. For example, the eruption of Mount Saint Helens actually cooled the Earth by 1 degree. Humans cause minimal damage to the environment, but nature on the other hand makes a massive impact. Carbon dioxide life span of 20 years and global warming can be reversed in 10- 20 year. If humans are the cause for global warming then the Earth would have been destroyed a long time ago."
"This research article discusses psychopathy as a personality disorder that has certain elements that the offender must meet before being clarified as psychopathic. This further helps to define and understand the role in which psychopathy plays within criminal profiling. This article coincides with other articles to further back up the findings from them as well. Turvey, B. E. (2012)."
"The logical focus makes me believe beyond any doubt that safe strategies for research are utilized. Be that as it may, in some cases, these methods don\u2019t work. The antibody might be arranged inaccurately, or it just may not work for whatever reason. Or possibly, a few medications that may have beneficial outcomes on the human body, can impact creatures in a destructive manner. if this is the case, what is to be done at this point? What to do if the antibody caused death? There is no chance to get back, tragically. In any case, the most upsetting thing is that not all creatures which are utilized for explores are ensured by the animal welfare act. Be that as it may, even those creatures, whose life is ensured, can get severely harmed. None of us can envision the torment amid these experiments. vision the torment amid these experiments."
"The way the author tackles the rise and fall of the Jim Crow era is another highlight of the book. Woodward\u2019s ideas were powerful yet dangerous and provoked reaction to varying degrees. The book relies heavily on a set of speeches given at the campus of University of Virginia in 1954 as its source document. To this day, the book, already in its third edition, is available in its original form and the author still manages to substitute captivating ideas for length. To conclude, the book is not only a nail in the coffin to the misconceptions forwarded by the Southern elite of the blacks being \u201cseparate but equal\u201d, the book also serves as a historical record of the time. Moreover, Woodward\u2019s association with the book lends it greater acceptance and legitimacy."
"The problem here is obvious, the more jobs that are lost because people are replaced by machines, the greater the amount of people who become in poverty. The numbers keep increasing. The UNFPA report we are launching today is of great importance and very timely: \u201cunleashing the potential of urban growth\u201d, as the report\u2019s subtitle indicates, represents the greatest challenge of this century. The diagnosis made in the report is beyond dispute: urbanization is inevitable, but it can also be positive. Furthermore, the report focuses on poverty since it is poor people who will make up a large part of future growth."
"Yet,again to counter that is a quote by the great American writer Ernest Hemingway,\u201dAll modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn\u2026it\u2019s the best book we\u2019ve had\u2026There has been nothing as good since\u201d(The Green Hills of Africa [Scribner\u2019s. 1953]22). The controversy behind the novel has been and will always remain the crux of any readers is still truly racism. Twain surely does use the word\u2018nigger\u2019often,both as a referral to the slave Jim and any African-American that Huck comes across and as the epitome of insult and inferiority."
"They always want what\u2019s best for them, and we can understand but, there\u2019s also a child involved in the situation. Abortion is not the way to go. There are many other options, such as websites, youtube videos, and friends and family that can help you take care of the child until your back up on your feet. \u201cInstead of aborting the baby, gather support around you instead. Your family is always a great place to run to, as are friends and the baby\u2019s father, but sometimes those people aren\u2019t there for you."
"My current work experience, my constant interaction with brand managers, and my marketing creativity passion from my childhood have driven me to a career desire in brand management. In my pursuit of a career in brand management, I have also witnessed the lack of staff diversity that is critical to optimal consumer product development and marketing. In my desire to work within the brand management industry, I have a parallel goal in desiring to influence to champion diversity at my company. While in college, I became a member of INROADS, an organization that gives minorities the opportunity to have professional internships while in college."
"Buying yourself those dream sunglasses? Or buying your best friend a tasty cup of coffee? Rising research suggests that the material purchases we make for ourselves (from designer bags to houses to gadgets) often fail to pay off in increased happiness. Yet, spending money on others and buying experiences can promote happiness. In this paragraph, we emphasize \u2018spending money\u2019 but of course it\u2019s not about the amount of money spend. It\u2019s about the experience of the receiver and the social aspect of giving."
"Antigone chooses to help her family and stand up for them, even when faced with death. Sophocles shows Antigone as a brave person by denouncing Creon\u2019s rules and saving her brother. Through Antigone\u2019s actions, Sophocles shows how he favors family over authority and the law. Sophocles expresses his devotion to family throughout Creon\u2019s actions in the tragic play. Prior to Creon\u2019s initial decision to let Antigone die, the Choragos convinces him to let her go free. Creon, reluctant at first, listens to the Choragos and says to them, \u201cIt is hard to deny the heart! \u201d (SceneV. 235)."
"Impact on the economy Immigration and economic change are inter-related: differences in the stock of immigrants across the region may be correlated with persistent differences in economic prosperity and changes to the economic success of a particular region may lead to increased (or decreased) immigration and emigration of existing residents (Dustmann, 2003). As the economic performance of cities may be measured differently, evaluating the short and long-term impacts by the immigrants on the economy is difficult (Spencer, 2002)."
"Pasta and pizza the two words are brought to mind when you think of Italy. The last thing that you think of is immigration. We see and hear about it nearly every day but it is usually Africa or Singapore. This essay will talk about the Immigration from Italy, Why they immigrated, how they got here, their roles when they got here, whether or not they were welcome, what they contributed to our society, what difficulties they faced, the process of getting here, how they were helped and what the status of immigration is like today."
"Every woman in the world should have the right to decide how to carry their beings. No government should feel that they have the right to dictate to a person what road their lives should take. Those claiming \u201cpro-life\u201d are really no more than \u201canti-choice\u201d. These pro-lifers crave to put the future of women into the hands of the government. Abortion, and any medical decisions women make, are very private and should never be available for debate. The question of morality can\u2019t be a valid argument concerning abortion, because it is not of morality but of option and constitutionality."
"Whether you\u2019re Black, White, or Guynease, anyone can be accepted and become a good friend. In my parents home country of Guyana, the diversity is limited and its shows as they still live as if they are in the 90\u2019s. Being as diverse as the United States has its challenges, races don\u2019t always get along, there is always a feeling of prejudice, and stereotypes put fake labels on people."
"\u201cEthnic Notions\u201d is an in depth look at the roots of African American racism and stereotypes. The movie goes through 150 years of racism and hatred towards black Americans, and the images that were spread throughout society that depicted African Americans to being lazy and careless. Also without slavery to keep them in check, myths say that they would resort to savage behavior."
"Crooks is isolated mainly due to his race. He is excluded from the other workers because he is black and disabled. This isolation is not only a mental one for Crooks but also a physical one as he has to sleep in the stable. He also thinks that most people are out to harm him so it is difficult for him to form any relationships, even if they were available to him. It was hard in those days to be accepted for who you are not your color. Being an old black man living in the barn all by himself, he is forced to read books to make his life seem less lonely. When he gets an opportunity he lashes all his anger out on Lennie and tells him that George won\u2019t come back, making Lennie feel upset. \u2018Crooks face lightened with pleasure in his torture\u2026 \u2018Well s\u2019pose, jus\u2019 s\u2019pose he don\u2019t come back. What\u2019ll you do then?\u201d (Steinbeck 70-71). These words show that he wanted Lennie to join him so he can have a companion instead of being all alone. He says that he would like to be part of the dream but quickly retreats himself as he knows he will not be accepted."
"There is almost no way of escaping being peed or pooped in my your baby, so be prepared. That being said one of the ways you can reduce this from happening is by placing a new diaper under the old one while changing them and do this fairly quickly to reduce the water fountains."
"Friendship is the \u201cessential source of pleasure and support\u201d for all human beings and animals. Friends bring us happiness and better the mental and physical health of mankind. Humans share deep connection which make for memorable and priceless times. As discussed previously good friends have few attributes that we look for, these attributes are not only in the good friends but in all friendships. The attributes include affection, communion and companionship. Love has similar attributes and shares many similar characteristics that close friend also have. After much research having a meaningful friendship will result in an increase of health and wellbeing. A good friend is something everyone strives to find and as we grow the expectations of our friends changes too."
"The parent replied, \u201cthey don\u2019t impose any harsh discipline practices. They explain consequences of the action, if children hit, bite, push. They also try to be positive always. Once Shubh pushed his classmate, the child didn\u2019t get hurt. They told me to talk to him at home about this and tell him it\u2019s wrong\u201d."
"Personal Identity refers to the essentials of a person. It includes those traits that distinguish one person from another and one\u2019s consciousness of his own being or identity (Encarta 2001). Defining one\u2019s own identity is a very important developmental task for any adolescent. From a psychosocial point of view, striving for a unified and integrated sense of self may assist in defining personal goals and the sense of direction. It may also promote the constructive integration into society. The search for identity is a persistent theme in our society."
"Like Simon de Beauvoir Manju Kapur wants the Indian society to view every woman as a human being. Kapur condemns the institution of conventional marriage where woman is viewed as a reproductive gadget and procreative tool only and underestimate her selfhood. In the conventional structure, the motherhood is viewed as a site of power for woman, as well as a site of exploitation. As the woman novelist, Kapur is well aware of the marginalisation of Indian women even in an independent India, she explicitly expresses her feminist vision by raising her voice against the Indian patriarchal system."
"And now, I am going to discuss the useful of Google search engine first. The most basic search results and the three main features that I am pointing it out about Google search engine was Anytime, Nearby, and Reading Level. For the basic, when I typed \u201cMechanical Engineering\u201d into the search box, then I got a long list of results instantly, which was about 143,000,000 results."
"I felt this way sometimes in the past. Then I got my power back. I was able to cope really well with these events, yes it took me sometimes to get where I am now, but gratefully I did it. Through this paper, I feel I am exploring and reviewing my family history very deeply, which is leading me to self-discovery. I started my life journey with my both parents and my two old siblings."
"From the foregoing assumptions, therapy for persons displaying the behaviors in question must consist of extinguishing a reasonable share of the behavioral variability in the repertoire and reinforcing behavioral stability and generalization; literally, to shape one personality. Kohlenberg (138) reported being able to increase the frequency of specific behaviors composing one personality of an individual who exhibited DID-like behaviors by differential reinforcement of that personality. When placed on extinction, these behaviors returned to baseline frequencies."
"And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof\u2026\u2019 (A1, S1, L26) He evaluates Cassio\u2019s status in the army to be less impressive and less qualified than him, yet Cassio still got the promotion and he was left as \u2018the Moorship\u2019s ancient\u2019 (A1, S1, L33). This jealousy of Cassio\u2019s rank causes Iago to plan revenge on Othello and also Cassio by causing him to get into a drunken fight, which results in him being dismissed from his job. Iago uses Othello\u2019s new dislike for Cassio to create a rumour that Desdemona is cheating on Othello with him. This eventually causes Othello to kill Desdemona and himself."
"Naturalism is portrayed in the novel of Mice and Men through the author\u2019s own sights and experiences. Just like his book, Steinbeck emulates his life experiences with highly realistic settings, and brutal characters with foul mouths that deal with depressing issues of life. Steinbeck truly pushed beyond the limits of standard writing, and showed us a side of good and evil like never before."
"Mill states, \u201d actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain, and the privation of pleasure.\u201d What the greatest happiness principle is, relates to the overall happiness of a population, rather than an individual."
"When reading this, I was reminded of what it was like to be a teenager, the inevitable question of identity and knowing but not knowing enough. Sarty felt the pressure to be what his father wanted him to be, but in his heart he knew his father was wrong. He did however try to rationalize his father\u2019s behavior in order to be what he thought he should be. He told himself his father was once a soldier, he should respect and honor him; he even tried to convince himself that his father was done with his criminal behaviors."
"The same problem exists today \u2026 our materialistic attitudes are a result of the freemarket economy in this country. Consumers are taught that they need to have all these things that the businesses are trying to sell. It\u2019s true that this desire for things is what drives our economy. The free market has given us great blessings, but it has in some ways also put us on the wrong path the path to a selfish, unhappy society."
"Riding around or walking in this area can be a complete filth, we got some people who just throw their trash all over the place. For instance, when I\u2019m riding around the area, you\u2019ll see bags of trash ripped all open and thrown on the side of the rode or sometimes even in the middle of the street and people will run over it and act like they don\u2019t see the trash, causing them to drag that trash further."
"Animal testing is a phrase that most people have heard but are perhaps still unsure of exactly what is involved. Whether it is referred to as animal testing, animal experimentation or animal research, it means the experimentation carried out on animals. Experimental animal testing has been one of the highest debated issues for many years. Animal testing is used for numerous products and applications. Everything from toiletries to medications has likely been tested on animals at some point prior to their distribution (Murnaghan)."
"George and Lennie have always dreamt of having there own farm despite their lack of money. To George having the farm somewhere in the future was a something for him to live for. Lennie believed having their own farm was just a fantasy which George would tell him to make him happy. The night before Lennie and George went to their new ranch, they slept in a small clear in the forest."
"Studies show great disparity in opinion exists depending on the type of practice. Nurses are far more likely to support family presence than are doctors. Resident physicians are the least open to family members remaining with the patient during a cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). One study done by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma, found that 75-80% of its physician members were opposed to family members being present during resuscitation or invasive procedures (Duran, Oman, Jordan, Koziel, & Szymanski, 2007)."
"YouTube is fitted with an algorithm designed to push people towards extremist content for engagement, in doing this, the platform drives users towards videos promoting extremist views and conspiracy theories, which prompt them to consume more information to the point where they begin to believe it. 94 percent of Australian youth use social media, 94 percent of Australian youth are being exposed to extremist content profit (Hughes, 2019). Major companies are exploiting our vulnerability for-profit, largely disregarding the consequences that may follow. With no relevant law pertaining to this matter, these major platforms continue to evade serious scrutiny over their complicity of spreading discriminatory content, increasing the prevalence of racism in today\u2019s society."
"His finding show that the results suggested that fans with high group identification rated fans who changed team allegiance significantly less trustworthy and reasonable, and more self-centred, than fans who were lower in group identity. Fans with high group identification also rated their partner, children, career and money significantly less important, whilst their football team was rated significantly more important (bps.org.uk)."
"A lot of times students disrespect the teacher in many ways. As students we are very stubborn and it takes a lot of warnings, maybe even a consequence, for us to be able to follow directions. One of the most common ways of a student disrespecting a teacher is talking during class, when they are not supposed to. Even when the teacher tells the students to stop speaking some of them will just completely ignore the teacher and not follow directions, continuing their conversation."
"Everybody can approach the problems of conflicts of interest among different countries by being united instead of pointing finger at any country that is the biggest contributor to global warming so we need to make a collective action to implement an effective, efficient and equitable response on the scale that is required (Review, 2006)."
"To be a Forensic Science Technician it is required to have a bachelor\u2019s degree in a natural science, such as chemistry or biology, or in forensic science. Many forensic scientists will have an undergraduate degree in the natural sciences and a master\u2019s degree in forensic science. Forensic science technicians will receive on-the-job training before they can work on cases independently. Certifications and licenses are not usually necessary for the entry-level of this job."
"It is a well-known fact that a child\u2019s education goes into three steps: a family where it starts then school, the place where it gets shape, and the social environment where a child\u2019s education continues its development. In other words, parents are the child\u2019s first teachers who are supposed(opt to) to be sources of motivation and support for them. So, it would be appropriate to say that the success of children in their education is due to the great corroboration between families, schools."
"Yet the relations between persons of the same faith, cultural background or ethnical origin are somtimes complex enough to cause collisions and tensions and so if there are absolutely different people who are supposed to live one next to another it might and it actually does result in much more serious misunderstanding, contempt or even hatred and violence."
"Villaruel had been influential to the zompes who were overwhelmed by anger and sadness of his death that made them continue to revolt against the authorities. Their fighting for freedom had inspired and awakened many. In addition, Chen this time had also found and promulgated Villaruel\u2019s entries about Bangalore which included the details about the Jambi \u2013 zombie \u201cdisease\u201d. He publicized these because he thinks that this will be useful for some and that he could help Villaruel in this way."
"The Welfare State was based on three key principle- full employment, universal welfare and free health and education. Beveridge set up the Welfare State under the principle of universalism: all those who need help should receive it. However, Beveridge assumed that the need would decline because the Welfare State would eliminate need and want in society. Unfortunately he was misguided in this idea but could not have predicted many of the subsequent changes in society. Between 1945 and 1979 the Conservative and Labour governments Welfare State was key in supporting disadvantaged families."
"Prejudice may or may not be eliminated from the face of the Earth, we cannot tell presently. As prejudiced as the world may be as of now, with gay marriage legalisation being strongly protested and religious conflicts all over the world today, it is very difficult to believe that prejudice can be eliminated in our lifetime. However, as previously mentioned, should we take a collective approach in teaching the younger generation to live without prejudice, then the elimination of prejudiced thinking may just become a reality in the future."
"Pro-choice advocates argue that rape is one of the most traumatic events a woman can experience and that in these occurrences aborting the pregnancy is her fundamental right to choose not to be a mother. This could be a young girl who has no concept of life as she has yet to experience it or live it or an older woman whose health may be at risk. The additional torment of being pregnant with the product of the violation against her can be physically and emotionally traumatizing. According to pro-choice believers , carrying an unwanted pregnancy is something no one should be forced to bare."
"The Padmanabhaih Committee on Police Reforms (2000) has observed, \u201cA large section of people strongly believe that police can not deliver and can not be effective if it does not use strong-arms methods against the criminals and anti-social elements of society. And these people include India\u2019s political class, the bureaucracy, and large sections of the upper and middle class."
"The outcome was lethal in 67/395 (17%) patients of which 55% had chorioamnionitis (p > 0.05).In comparison with the control group, mortality was significantly higher in the group of premature infants with gestation at or before 28 weeks whose placentas showed chorioamnionitis (p 0.05). In conclusion, premature neonates from pregnancies complicated by chorioamnionitis are more often born at or before 28 weeks of gestation, and chorioamnionitis in such neonates leads to a significantly higher rate of mortality. A greater incidence of EONS was proven in the group of infants with chorioamnionitis."
"John Locke and Immanuel Kant were both believers in self they just both brought out different points and views on it. After looking at and analyzing claims from both I still find Locke\u2019s to be more persuasive because first he discussed (Chaffee, 2016) identifying what it means to be a person, distinguishing a person, and what a person is considered. On the other hand, Kant believes that self has an inner and outer and that\u2019s what forms the consciousness. Locke also believes that one is born with an empty soul. I believe this to be true because as babies we learn from what we see and what we were taught. \u201cPerspectival self-consciousness is a special instance of our more general ability as perceivers to keep track of how things are.\u201d (Noe, 2002)."
"Ideally, the black women held perhaps the lowest position in the community. The formation of a female voice has also been an indispensable concern of women of other ethnic minorities. The women need an improvement in the black social and economic realities that would be realized through gradual and natural means via accommodation and cooperation as opposed to self-assertion. The topic of violence against black women is another issue that women undergo and how to aggressively manage to fight the obstacles of racism and sexism."
"Importantly, empowerment of non commissioned officer\u2019s contributed to quality of work that American\u00a0soldiers have done and are doing, and this is possibly the reason why American soldiers are ranked the best in the world. Owing to the dynamics and the changing trends of the battle fields and the need for military to pace up with this trends, the United States of America will continue to improve and empower its military to prepare them for the future. The definition of disrespect is lack of respect, discourtesy, or rudeness. In the United States Military, there are rules and regulations you must follow, one of them being respect to a non commissioned officer. No matter the circumstance, whether you agree or not, you are not allowed to talk back, physically fight back, or question judgment. If this does happen, there are consequences and repercussions from the actions taken on your part. Uniformed Code of Military Justice states that you can ultimately be separated, honorably or dishonorably for actions taken on your part."
"This shows that although Georgiana is opposed to her mother\u2019s attitude towards the marriage she has to show respect towards her and therefore doesn\u2019t express this to her. The mother seems to be organising the marriage for her own benefit, rather than the interest of her daughters. She sees the marriage as a way of creating a position for herself in society, rather than for the goodwill of her daughters. Mary is oblivious to this, but Georgiana is able to see that being wed is not about love, but rather status. This proves her strong feelings for how society was in the nineteenth century. These feelings are exactly what Austen has tried to portray through the character of Georgiana. Her defiance of society is why the story was written, so she could express her feelings to others."
"The lower class constantly gets put down throughout the novel by the upper class so they can maintain hierarchy, whether it being from racism, a act of dominance or pure hate. Aminata\u2019s owners would abuse her due to the fact that she was lower in social status then them and that they had more power then her. The Americans would call Aminata names like \u201cThe crazy big mouthed African\u201d (Hill, 175) to say that she is a crazy African and nothing more. Aminata\u2019s friend says that \u201cyou call a white man white, he beat you black and blue\u201d (Hill, 129). Africans being in the lower class would not be allowed to call a white man \u201cwhite\u201d because they are not defined as humans in the eyes of people in the 18th century. Enslaving Africans would cause them not to be moved up in society keeping whites hierarchy in place. \u201cWhite men and women in any social stratum, regardless of education, skills, ideological convictions, ethnic affiliations, gender, or sexual orientation, are aware that American society favors them over all African Americans\u201d (Wilkinson)."
"As seen by many different mothers in the novel Sula by author Toni Morrison, mothers play an important part in kid\u2019s life, shaping how they view different beliefs in the world and setting up values in their child. Every individual\u2019s life is shaped by personal relationships they have with others. The mother and child relationship greatly affects the identity development in the kid. As seen in the racist community in the novel, the mother and kid relationship is important in the sense that the mothers and children share understanding of the sexist oppression, intertwining their lives together even more than they already were."
"The children are subject to \u201cnegative stereotyping and discrimination by their peers,\u201d and \u201cself-esteem issues, negative body image, depressive symptoms\u201d (Braet, Calamaro and Waite, Hesketh, Koplan, Miller and Downey 24). This proves that Critser\u2019s solution is not going to work. His solution won\u2019t work because, when one is trying to stigmatize the behavior of overeating, then the person who is obese is also subject to the stigmatization. Furthermore, the parents also play a vital role when their child is obese. Children learn through what they see especially when they are at a young age."
"I think the main reason why Kaye\u2019s original vision never made it to the film was because it clashed so much with McKenna\u2019s original message. McKenna wrote the film based off of his personal experience witnessing acts of racisms in Southern California in throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s. Whereas, Kaye is not only much older than McKenna, but grew up in United Kingdom and had only been living in the United states for a few years before he got involved in the film at all, and, therefore, did not quite have the same outlook for the script (Topel)."
"The only reason the white man was following the black man was because he did not want to get robbed again. The black man did not know that, so that\u2019s why he felt as though the white man was racists. All whites are not racist but it\u2019s just the bad things that some blacks do that hurt the whole race. A black lady comes to an interview to be a greeter at a restaurant. She has all the certification and experience that is need for the job."
"This shows how Slim is presented as a man who is very wise which leads people to trusting him. This is shown when it says, \u201chis tone was friendly. It invited confidence without demanding it.\u201d This illustrates how people can trust because of Slim\u2019s gentle nature. The ranch workers are shown in to respect because of the hierarchy and because he is the noble ranch worker when it says, \u201cthey precede him.\u201d This shows his authority within the ranch as they respect him and because of his position in the hierarchy of the ranch. As Slim is part of the hierarchy of the ranch he described as when moving \u201cwith a majesty only achieved by royalty.\u201d This is shown to emphasize his position within the ranch hierarchy and this presents the idea that he is like the prince of the ranch. As slim is skilled he is called a \u201cJerkline skinner\u201d which shows he is very noble. This gives the impression that as he has great skilled and a great depth of perception he almost emanates calm and understanding."
"Before that, my dad would bring me to family get together, or dinner with friends to brag about me, represent me with this false image of perfection, overly exaggerating each of my accomplishments, so he could be seen a \u201csuccessful father figure\u201d to his friends. Other parents would do the same thing and it became a vicious cycle for the kids. It was not about the kids at the end of the day, but rather about the parents themselves. I thought it was selfish and self-absorbed. It made me incredibly self-conscious and ultimately became, a try-hard. I carried the urge of making my parents proud of their only daughter, and then continue to be a trophy for them to carry around and brag with other people. I remember the bar was raised every time my dad noticed my inferior to his friends\u2019 kids, and it was a living nightmare. It reminds me the pride that Sir Gawain carries that he holds on so tightly that it became of his life that influenced his life decisions, in this case, my dad\u2019s unfair expectation for me to succeed to boost his pride. All that being said, I understand my parents\u2019 hardship, and I only came to this question because realizing that your parents are just human beings and not totems to be put on a pedestal is just a part of growing up, and I accept that. My parents might think that I bring shame to the name I carry but it\u2019s time for me to think for myself. If I ever planned on having kids, they would be the best version of themselves and no one can change that. With that in mind, I want to end with an Emerson quote: \u201cI suffer whenever I see that common sight of a parent or senior imposing his opinion and way of thinking and being on a young soul to which they are totally unfit. Cannot we let people be themselves, and enjoy life in their own way? You are trying to make that man another you. One\u2019s enough.\u201d"
"The many protests and rallies have led to the creation of many support groups that are willing to fight for the African American community and their cause. Activists groups such as Black Lives Matter have begun to bring more attention to the issue at hand and seek justice for their community. Black lives matters is an international activist\u2019s movement that protests and rallies against violence towards black people. The organization originated in the black community and began to protest the killings of African Americans by law enforcement (). Black Lives Matter is nationally recognized for the street demonstrations after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the Shooting of Trayvon Martin (). The organization brought the eyes and attention of people from all around the world to witness the brutal beating and killing of the black community. Supporter\u2019s around the world join together to aid the fight for social equality in the African American community."
"In this poem, Duffy projects men as greedy:\u00a0\u2018He wanted more\u2019\u00a0adulterous:\u00a0\u2018Then take his lust to Soho in cab\u2019\u00a0and frivolous:\u00a0\u2018Faust was Cardinal, Pope, knew more than God, flew faster than the speed of sounds around the globe, lunched; walked on the moon, golfed, hole in one; lit a fat Havana on the sun\u2019.\u00a0I can agree that feminism is a strong theme in The World\u2019s Wife; however, there are exceptions to this.\u00a0Anne Hathaway is not ridiculing men in anyway it is merely celebrating love."
"A play opportunity for imaginative learning could be to children playing with small world play such a Lego or animals. Children\u2019s plays needs at the age of 3-4 years is still pretend and are beginning to represent the world in picture form. This type of activity is linked to the early learning goals by mathematics \u2013 number, calculating, shape, space and measures. Other early learning goals are able to be met while children use their creative development to explore media and materials, music, imagination, responding to experiences, and expressing and communicating ideas."
"Paul D\u2019s struggle with his loss of identity and self-conception is enhanced with Morrison\u2019s use of gothic elements. The most prominent of Paul D\u2019s struggles with identity comes from his \u201cmanhood,\u201d or lack thereof. At Sweet Home, Paul D \u201cgrew up thinking that, of all the Blacks in Kentucky, only the five of them were men. Allowed, encouraged to correct Garner, even defy him\u201d (Morrison 147)."
"There is more to the idea of cultural preservation that is contained in the element of racism. The Germans find a scapegoat in the Jews as its solution to the country\u2019s internal woes. Self-protection is the primary method being employed in establishing the answers to the questions of the greater population. In an economic crisis, people want solutions to the difficult plight that they are in. The government is just too willing to hand over to them the twisted truth of the matter on hand."
"Furthermore, Curley\u2019s wife uses the word \u2018nigger\u2019 and it also dehumanises Crooks and puts him \u2018in his right place\u2019. Curley\u2019s wife is also near the bottom of the social ladder as well as Crooks worldly Despite the fact that Crooks is a victim of racism, Steinbeck presents Crooks as a dignified human being."
"Child advocates direct an assortment of procedures to help families and children encountering misuse. These suggestions tend to center around societal endeavors and also more individual endeavors. One basic system supported is the utilization of open administration declarations that urge people to report any presumed child abuse. As of now, numerous obligatory journalists (those required by law to report abuse, for example, educators, specialists, and social administration office representatives) and individuals from groups feel that child abuse ought not to be accounted for unless there is generous confirmation that mishandles is to be sure happening."
"You are able to use longer more complex sentences, giving more than one instruction at any one time. Ultimately, it is experience that discerns how communication should proceed. A child would be learning things for the first time whereas an adult will be an experienced communicator and so will have a natural understanding of how to behave with others. It isn\u2019t always obvious that an adult may have communication differences, in these cases you should approach with sensitivity and care. It maybe, that English maybe a second language for the adult you are communicating with."
"Additionally, the mental disorder may also explain why the violence has happened. In 2009, there is a literature review found out that around 65 percent of people who had committed murder-suicides were suffering from depression, and it may explain why the old man may choose to kill his wife because he had suffered from severe depression and confirmed by three psychiatrists."
"Despite the failure of the reconstruction act and rise of the white-supremacy and as well as the widely practiced Jim Crow laws that kept the black socially segregated, also subjected black Americans to be second-class citizens, these three-reconstruction era amendments fundamentally changed and put the country in the right direction for a better civil rights practice toward minorities especially blacks. Moreover, these amendments established the fighting ground in the civil rights movement in the 1950s and the 1960s enabling blacks to win importing cases such as Brown vs. Board of Education, forcing schools to start to integrate blacks into whites\u2019 schools."
"Shared experiences can also allow individuals to understand one another, leading to acceptance and therefore belonging. The migrant hostel inhabitants share the experiences of war, shown through the last lines of the stanza \u2018Partitioned off at night by memories of hunger and hate\u2019. This discomfort is what allows them to understand one another and form relationships, which leads to belonging. The concept of belonging is conveyed through places. Migrant Hostel shows the concept of belonging in places by showing that a place can unite people."
"Once men had the power in the world, they would fight to hold on to it. Religion, \u201cscience\u201d, and social structure would be used for thousands of years to keep women subservient to their male counterparts. As men took over, the structure of society and the family unit changed drastically. The role of fathers and father figures in the assigned readings so far shows different responsibilities owed to a father based on time period and society in which they live."
"Teenagers are at the age when they are starting to establish their identity. Neologisms are created by teenagers to claim a different identity from that of children or adults. As adults become more familiar with these lexemes and their use, teenagers abandon them or alter the semantics and use to maintain a linguistic barrier. A good example of this is the well-known acronym \u201clol\u201d which stands for Laugh Out Loud. As more adults become aware of this lexical item and start to include it in their daily texts, teenagers have brought it into speech as an exclamatory and discourse particle. The case of the letters now also alters the semantics; when typed in lower-case, \u201clol\u201d is sarcastic whilst \u201cLOL\u201d in capital letters shows true amusement. It is evident that this constant changing of terms by teenagers is a sign of rebellion and an effort to keep a linguistic barrier between themselves and adults, thus maintaining a separate identity. The malleability of the lexicon is taken advantage of by teenagers to form a linguistic barrier between themselves and unwanted people such as adults and other teenagers who don\u2019t belong in their group. Thus, a unique identity is maintained."
"Moreover, in these suburban towns, built in the 1950s in imitation of the Soviet social housing of the Stalinist era, people live in crammed conditions, sometimes several generations in a tiny apartment, and see \u201creal French life\u201d only on television. As a result, this discrimination and intolerance of the immigrants by the white population increases discontent, fosters apartheid and ends in hatred and violence. Another problem of these neglicted banlieus is the fact that more and more of its native French inhabitants leave for \u201ccalmer places,\u201d which makes the assimilation still more difficult and create homogenous ghettoes."
"Schools systemically valorize upper-class cultural capital while depreciating lower class capital The job market reinforces the superior academic credentials earned mainly by the upper classes Schools legitimize the process by converting social hierarchies to academic ones Basil Bernstein uses language patterns to link micro and macro sociological issues. Bernstein argues that one\u2019s class will determine a distinct form of speech through family socialization. This results in working class children being surrounded by a restricted code of linguistics while middle class children use more elaborate codes. Bernstein\u2019s linguistic codes refer to the underlying regulative principles that govern the selection and combination of different syntactic and lexical constructions that are derived from social relations and roles within families."
"To link with my research question on ex-convict relationships with family members, I felt that the best way to review on ex-convicts would be conducting the experiment in Singapore. Experienced interviewers with fluent English should be brought in to allow smooth communication. Participants that included youth offenders and ex-convicts will be analyzed based on their status of their relationships between family members. In order to find the correct participants for the experiment, the method of purposive sampling should be used as advised by Lilienfeld\u2019s, (2017) article. When it comes to the research of ex-convicts, participant\u2019s selected should not initiate any sort of subtle racism (Lilienfeld\u2019s, 2017) towards other participants. To prevent any forms of miscommunication, all participants should literate in the English language (Picco, Lau, Pang, Abdin, Vaingankar, Chong, & Subramaniam\u2019s 2017)."
"Once you fulfill these requirements that are extremely relevant to the process of becoming a citizen the next step is to complete an application and collect necessary documentation. Although the application is tedious and you will get interviewed on some of the questions, it is crucial that the applicant answers truthfully. This step helps the officers get a good idea on who should remain eligible for citizenship. If your application is passed a few remaining steps include photographs of yourself, fingerprints, and the send of all applications and fees for review. Finally if the officers believe you are citizenship material you will receive a pass decision and take the Oath of Allegiance in a ceremony setting."
"Stereotyping, discrimination and prejudice is a very immense issue which should be given much attention. It can affect the individual in developing his or her personality and low self-esteems, it leads to build up feelings and hatred towards others, it prevents the employment of qualified people into certain positions, tribal conflicts and disagreements and on the larger scale, affects the development of KNUST. 4.3 RECOMMENDATION"
"It is necessary to bring together the functions of the management and employees with the expectations of the external stakeholders. This creates a cordial business relation that undoubtedly builds a strong corporate reputation. In essence, in order to enhance the company\u2019s reputational competence, there is a need for the diverse stakeholders to work together in tandem."
"While Hekker explains how she is embarrased, Edelman is feeling frustrated and useless as a housewife. According to Hekker, \u201cMs. Putdown asked me who I was. I told her I was Jack Hekker\u2019s wife\u2026 She took my hand and asked if that was all I though of myself-just someone\u2019s wife? \u201d (392). In this quote, Hekker has a difficult time revealing to others that she doesn\u2019t really enjoy the career of a housewife but has no better skills than to be a modeled-housewife. According to Edelman, \u201cIt began to make me spitting mad, the way daily duties of parenting and homeownership started to rest entirely on me\u2026"
"He wants to belong in a place where he feels potential within his own self-confidence and to not be judged by others. Such as, \u201cThey stared at me, the Indian boy with the black eye and swollen nose, my going-away gifts from Rowdy. Those white kids couldn\u2019t believe their eyes. They stared at me like I was Bigfoot or a UFO."
"Before any of this happens Macbeth meets three witches, they all tell him that he shall become thane of Cawdor also King! He dosn\u2019t take much note of it, until, later in the play he is premoted to \u2018Thane of Cawdor\u2019, which is the equivalent to becoming a Lord. This obviously changes Macbeth\u2019s state of mind, and in act 1 scene 7 the first sign of Jealous i displayed."
"In this section, PEACE is to focus on convincing the funder\u2019s that this agency is very well-trusted and is uniquely qualified. It is important to have full confidence in the support of this agency as well as gaining community trust. It should also include track records that provide PEACE\u2019s program capacities and fiscal abilities. A management plan should also be included. Management plan details the staf\ufb01ng and their responsibilities, the chain of command, and the project\u2019s relations to the other programs within the organization (Yuen & Terao, 2003). It should also be no more than three pages. BUDGET AND BUDGET JUSTIFICATIONS"
"Chaim Potok\u2019s The Chosen describes a friendship between two very different boys. The author uses strong character development and symbolism to show how a friendship between two dissimilar people can alter their lives. By describing the characters\u2019 development throughout the story, the author shows how Reuven and Danny are impacted by their friendship. The symbol of the eye illustrates how the boys\u2019 perception was expanded and their world was changed. As a result of these techniques, the author creates a story of a life changing friendship."
"However, Galileo was financially struggling. In order to advance his findings, he found himself in a personal predicament; to lie about inventing the telescope to gain 500 scudi. Unashamedly, Galileo fabricated that it was his own invention to procure the extra funding. Although this deceptive act caused dispute, both within Galileo, and later on in the play with the Procurator, it demonstrated the need for conflict to enable progress. Galileo so blatantly stole someone else\u2019s invention, as he saw it as an opportunity to help himself and the greater society by advancing his own research, rather than an issue of moral responsibility."
"The intestinal type or otherwise known as primary villoglandular mucinous ade-nocarcinoma of the vulva, otherwise known as cloacogenic adenocarcinoma. Hypothe-sis that intestinal neoplasia of the vulva could develop from cloacal remnants. Since the lower vagina is derived from the urogenital tract, enteric neoplasia of the lower genital tract could develop from loci of gastrointestinal metaplasia from cloacal remnants. A case of an 68-year-old woman who had a vulvar lump, with histopathologic findings of mucinous adenocarcinoma, no invasion nor microinvasion of the tumor cells was reported. This patient was then treated by vulvar tumor resection and remains disease free 5 years after surgery.8"
"All these building blocks of friendship and what is meant to be a friend are beautifully illustrated through Doyle\u2019s famed detective and his trusted companion from the moment they meet. So, for Aristotle: \u2018To be friends, then, the must be mutually recognized as bearing goodwill and wishing well to each other\u2019 (Aristotle, and Ross. 2016: 311)"
"In the quote Amy Chua evidently builds up her authority and the readers trust towards Chua, because she knows what she is talking about, she has done it. Furthermore, with the use of statistics such as \u201calmost 70% of the Western mothers said [\u00b7] \u201cstressing academic success is not good for children\u201d [\u00b7]. By contrast, roughly 0% of the Chinese mothers felt the same way\u201d (line 35). Amy Chua also appeals to the readers sense with logos. With the help of the statistics Amy Chua compares the two different types of parents. Stating the fact that western parents are soft minded and protective towards their kids thinking they are fragile, which the Chinese parents do not. Moreover, Chua compares the Chinese children and the western in the following quote \u201cChinese parents spend approximately 10 times as long every day drilling academic activities with their children."
"It is also possible that because of affirmative action, racism within an organisation will increase. If a company hires a black person who is not as good as another white candidate, employees will begin to resent him/her. If they gained their job based on their skin colour, rather than because they were the most qualified, they may become disliked and resented because of their skin colour. This could also lead to lack of respect for a black boss which would be detrimental to the organisation and the happiness of employees."
"Michael Omi and Howard Winant maintain that \u201cRace is more a political categorization that a biological or scientific category\u201d (Rothenberg, 2010, p. 10). Racial distinctions can be correlated with economic and political changes in the society of the United States. In California, 1854, the state Supreme Court ruled in the case, People v. Hall that Chinese Americans should be barred from testifying against whites as Indians and Negroes had previously been barred with a California statue. The judges \u201cmarked [Chinese-Americans] as inferior, and \u2026"
"Documentaries are also important to show the world some urgent troubles in the world, like global warming. I know that every time i see a documentary that shows how global warming is getting worse, I feel guilty and I\u2019m more aware of biking to school instead of going by car."
"Near the movie\u2019s end a riot breaks out; Radio Raheem, a black guy, dies while being arrested by American policemen; and Sal\u2019s pizzeria is burned down as instigated by Mookie, who finally realizes that his commitment to his racial background was more important compared to his loyalty to his Italian employer, or any other race for that matter. The film depicted the life of the Black Americans from the point of view of a black person."
"In this article, the author use different references for her research, she explained in her article \u201cwomen men and politeness\u201d are agreeable and disagreeable. Women and men behave differently according to Holmes (2006) women reply in a more polite way than men. Women are well-mannered with others and they are very kind. Men are completely different according to Holmes, in some contexts, \u201caggressive and competitive verbal behaviour appears to be experienced as thoroughly enjoyable and mutual insults may even serve as expression of positive politeness and solidarity\u201d (Holmes, p.330). She explained in her examples that girls are more cooperative with each other then the boys. She studied among the children and found out that boys used more bold disagreements, which means they are talking the exact point no more description, but girls tried to expand the conversation with out any reason according to Maria Stubbe (1991)."
"The Versailles Treaty also forced Germany to pay huge amounts of money to the Allies. Germany was forced to take loans from the United States in order to pay this money. Once the Great Depression started in the United States, the banks started demanding that Germany repay their loans, causing the German economy to suffer even more during this difficult period. The Nazis promised to make Germany a great country. This helped the Nazis take control of the government of Germany, as everybody wanted change in the government that would help rebuild their country."
"Global Warming is the rise in the average temperature of Earth\u2019s atmosphere and oceans since the late 19th century and its projected continuation. Many people do not see this as a problem. However, it is currently a huge issue that is often talked about among scientists and many other people. Global Warming is caused by many different things. Greenhouse gases, deforestation, and solar activity are three different proven facts that cause global warming. Global warming is not something that is going to disappear; it is only going to get worse if people do not start doing something about it."
"Her mom utilized to offer piano lessons. The first 8 years of her life that she spent in a town left an imprint on her that shows in the poem too; the rhythm of music and the beat of pan, the call of the fisherman and the fruit supplier, the odour of mud and salt when she went crab hunting (\u201cthe crab\u2019s leg\u201d), the entire of the morning sky, the whole of the night sky, (\u201cdaybreak\u201d and \u201cmoon\u2019s eye\u201d). The poem is also recurring, \u2018replenishing renewing\u2019. The poet may have gone with this since it brings a sense of childhood as a kid would duplicate words."
"These \u2018starting grids\u2019 will be tested at London Gatwick and London Heathrow before being put into practice in other airports at home and abroad. Jill Brady of Virgin Atlantic commented, \u201cOnce we have examined the results of the test trials, we will be able to look at creating centres of excellence at the busiest airports around the world, airports which share Virgin Atlantic\u2019s goal of reducing fuel burn and CO2 emissions both on the ground and in the air.\u201d It is hoped that this new system will make airports far more efficient and reduce the carbon emissions before take off by up to 90%. As the aircraft would then be able to carry less fuel for the duration of the flight, the aircraft will be lighter and more carbon friendly. (The Economist 2006)"
"China\u2019s Impact on South Koreans Economic Growth China\u2019s emergence has affected the Korean economy and is now the major market for Korean exports and a major supplier of its inexpensive imports. Also, it has become a serious contender to Korea in the world markets for manufacturing exports. In 1987, due to a formal diplomatic relationship, the economic dealings between South Korea and China have expanded and trade has developed in diversity, size and capital movements. These increases, in both trade and investment, evolved between 1989 and 2004 and are signs of growing economic interdependence. Also, the East Asian economies have seen an increase in the restructuring of production and an increase in their intra-regional trade."
"Which are the difference / gap between first generation (father) and second generation (son). * Concept The company is implementing a conservative approach. The company is not actively sought for new customer and do not take risk in new investment. Solution * The company communicates to the market and gets other suppliers in order to minimize the cost. By this the company found different supplier and compare the price. * The authority among father and son are differentiated clearly. So, the decision made by the son is not affected by the father.

"Maintaining facial hair is more prevalent among African American men than in other male populations in the U. S. In fact, the soul patch is so named because African American men, particularly jazz musicians, popularized the style. The preference for facial hair among African American men is due partly to personal taste, but because they are more prone than other ethnic groups to develop a condition known as pseudofolliculitis barbae, commonly referred to as razor bumps, many prefer not to shave.

"These stages explore the maturity of the class and how their values change throughout the course of the year. When Braithwaite first begins teaching he is faced with racist comments and the uncooperative rudeness of his students. The teenagers refer to him as \u201ca new \u2018blackie\u2019 teacher\u201d. This illustrates the racial prejudice which existed in the East End of London at that time. The students are obnoxious to the person he is, all they see is the colour of his skin. Braithwaite experiences a cold attitude from his class, \u201cI begun to feel a bit uneasy under their silent, concentrated appraisal\u201d."
"In living this life, of course we will never escape from a problem that will come one after another to test how much our patience in passing each of our days is increasingly diminished by age. However, because of that we must also try to make our lives useful, give goodness to ourselves and others."
"Higher rat\u00e5s of dating viol\u00e5nc\u00e5 across studies were consistently report\u00e5d by African Am\u00e5rican coupl\u00e5s. For example, a survey was conducted by McLaughlin and his coll\u00e5agues. The survey consisted of 150 African Am\u00e5rican and 458 Caucasian coupl\u00e5s. Between 19 percent and 23 percent of black and whit\u00e5 m\u00e5n reported using mild aggression, such as grabbing, shoving, and pushing their partners. How\u00e5ver, 25 percent of black m\u00e5n reported using moderate aggression, which included slapping and choking th\u00e5ir partners compar\u00e5d with 12 percent of whit\u00e5 m\u00e5n."
"Lori B. Girschick has presented her report on this issue objectively as she collected accounts for these offenses from the mouths of the female offenders.\u00a0 As pointed out earlier, female offenses are categorized by some of the following reasons as battered and abused women since childhood (p. 70), drug-connected (p. 71), and breaking the law out of economic needs (p. 72)."
"The Functionalist view states that prejudice serves a function by creating in-group solidarity. It also states that prejudice creates a common enemy and serves to define discriminated groups as dysfunctional. In this case, Singaporeans, in general, form an in-group unity by ostracising the Bangladeshis and regarding them as dysfunctional because they are \u201cdirty\u201d and \u201csmelly\u201d. Therefore, the Functionalist view shows how a racial group is discriminated by others."
"\u2013 Some analysts wonder why it took so long for Toys R Us to jump into the e-commerce bandwagon and protect its new sales channel: online purchasing. Kalakota and Robinson (2000) believed that Toys R Us, along with other big named entities, are not very much sold to the idea of selling online, guessing the reasons why these entities they called the \u2018traditionalists\u2019 are not willing disciples of the new form of trade which many consumer opted for because of convenience, above all the other reasons. The unsure stance of Toys R Us when it comes to embracing e-commerce was no doubt one of the reasons why its marketing aspect experienced a temporary glitch."
"Notably, taking a kneel can also be seen to unite the society in a number of ways. To begin with, it is important to realize that players of all races take part in the NFL.[7] It is common knowledge that people of all walks unite during an aversive occurrence. Although police brutality is not limited to blacks, Kaepernick takes the role of doing the unimaginable and links the brutality to racial oppression. It is his act that drives the president to instruct team owners to sack any player who kneels during the national anthem. Following Trump\u2019s direction, payers in various teams unite in protest. As a result, more players have been seen kneeling during the national anthem, and some sitting. This reveals that the act has united football players to peacefully protest against the said racial profiling. Other sources indicate that while Kaepernick protested specifically against police brutality, the current kneeling is against social injustices, among them the direction to fire players that Trump aired. This shows how the controversy has enabled the minority group to unite and air their views[8], which is one of the ways to overcome the tyranny of the majority."
"The topic of immigration has always been a controversial topic, with many complications and technicalities, and this issue appears to be even more present in our current political landscape. As our current leader in the White House fights for stricter borders, many activists are leading efforts to help refugees and other foreigners seeks a home here despite strict immigration laws. Authors Aisha Dodwell and George Gallatin express their conflicting viewpoints in articles that try to help us understand the different viewpoints on our borders."
"Male friends tend to know what to do when solving problems amongst significant others while being truthful. Male friends usually don\u2019t express too many feelings because they don\u2019t want to seem sensitive to the point where they seem soft. Male friends are often called best friends or casual male friends. They usually connect over common interest or situations. Male friends tend to have less drama. They are usually easier to talk to and less judgmental. Female friend like to talk about their problems aloud and they usually can\u2019t keep to themselves because they normally like to vent and let whatever it is out and off their chest mind and heart."
"I believe an appropriate manner to see Charles Manson \u2018s adolescence would be to analyze the theory of fond regard. The twenty-four hours his female parent got out of prison was the happiest twenty-four hours of his life ( Emmons, 1994 ) . However, this joy was short lived ( merely like all the joy Manson of all time experienced ) . His female parent got involved with a adult male that did non like the thought that Kathleen had a kid. The adult male merely wanted Kathleen in his life so that is what he got. She pleaded to the tribunal that she could non decently care for him and Manson was placed in an all male child \u2018s school. Manson was heartbroken and says in Emmons \u2018 book, \u201c lonelier than I of all time was in my full life. I merely wanted to populate with her under any fortunes. \u201d"
"The report will then conclude by summarizing what the data means, and what has information has been learned from this report. It will then be followed by references and the appendices which will contain a copy of the questionnaire used as well as literature used for the literature review and a set of tables and charts with the data on it."
"As we have seen written, viewed, and upheld in most states, employment-at-will is almost always enforced. This is to say that employers can hire or fire someone, with cause, without cause, or no cause at all. Which means if Eddie wanted to fire Jane for blowing the whistle on him and his brother Greg by going to Brad in the matter\u00b7it could leave Jane, Brad, Eddie, and Greg as well as his business in a precarious position. It can be a slippery slope. Although Jane must keep a certain level of confidentiality when it comes to salaries and payrolls, this doesn\u2019t mean that she should keep silent about unethical actions."
"Mum could not offer any reasons for her behaviour but told me problems had arisn at home that were unusual behaviour traits for her. One morning her mother dropped her off and she was very distressed and her mum asked me to take her from her and try to settle her into school. Her mother told me she didn\u2019t know what the problem was. I took the child into a quiet room and I chatted to her about my morning until she stopped crying. She then told me her older brother went in her room every morning while she was getting changed."
"Decorating their rooms in colours that they like. By doing this it gives them control over an aspect of their life, therefore having a positive effect on their well being and help them to feel comfortable in their room. Furnishing the house with furniture of their choosing. This also gives them a choice in their life. Giving them a sense of self worth, will help with their well being and make them feel happy. Using support documentation, such as service user plans to provide continuity of care in the current placement. This will help you to understand their likes and dislikes and can help you provide an environment that would help their well being. Recognise and respect their personal boundaries and preferences."
"My brother always has been an inspiration to me because he has set a great example for me to follow. He is always helping my parents with anything they need, and does many errands around the house. My brother taught me the same lessons that he had to learn growing up."
"Thus, the primary question remains, is it morally permissible to disconnect yourself from a person, even if doing so will kill them? Thomson then takes the violinist scenario a step further, asking us to imagine that it turns out that supporting the violinist is putting additional strain on you, and if you continue to remain plugged into him, you will die. Some would say that it is still impermissible, because unplugging yourself would be directly killing the innocent violinist which is murder, and always wrong."
"More also has an understanding of them, even when they steal his wine. \u201cMatthew, I shall miss you.\u201d While the play centre on More\u2019s choice to die rather than sign over his name on the Act, it\u2019s easy to determine how More\u2019s characteristics are presented to the audience. If More is defined with his words, \u201ca man\u2019s soul is his self\u201d, then the Common Man may best be defined by his philosophy, \u201cbetter a live rat than a dead lion\u201d. Even at times the Common Man is dishonest, manipulating, unscrupulous and disloyal; he is a master of living in the society. He changes his values easily like the water bounce back when hit on the bank. Thomas More held his unchangeable principles"
"A Phishing scam is when you are tricked into giving out personal information from a fake trusted site. An example of this would be if you received an official looking email from your bank or credit card company that directs you to a site made to look like the legit webpage. They will then ask you for your password and login details or require you to update your personal information."
"This means that people are starting to have to go through tests to make sure that they are not getting married just for the purpose of citizenship. However \u201cthe UK immigrants Advisory Service has already begun proceedings against this rule in the European court, on grounds of both racial discrimination an its attack on the right to marry according to choice and to live in the country of citizenship\u201d. (Jacobs 1075) There is much controversy over the issue but the one thing that is certain is that an extreme amount of racism and sexism is being used when dealing with these people. This reference is of value to my research because it shows how even though we might be trying to get non-citizens out of the country, we will never be able to do it properly until we are able to put aside the sexism."
"Physical play also decreases the risk of developing health conditions like heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity and other health conditions. Play and learning activities support the physical development of young children, the support that these activities provide can help the children develop their skills. One key activity which helps develop a child\u2019s skills is: outdoor play. This allows the child\u2019s imagination to run wild, and also their bodies too."
"In the first stage of Fowler\u2019s Theory of Faith Development, Primal Faith, is technically a pre-stage. It is the interaction between an infant and the primary caregiver during the first year of life providing a foundation for faith by basic trust vs. mistrust. The next stage, Intuitive-Projective Faith, begins when the child starts talking. It is characterized by the wild imagination of the child. In this stage, God is a powerful part of the imagination, similar to Santa Claus (Parker, 2006.)"
"Family is more important to Cuban Americans. At times there is up to three generations living under one household. It is very common for the older generation to live with their children. This is very common, especially when one of the older generations passes on and the spouse that is now widowed or widower will go and live with the children. Puerto Ricans The next largest group of Hispanic Americans in the United States is the Puerto Ricans. Puerto Ricans speak Castilian Spanish. However, 40% of the group is bilingual and mostly speaking English. When in the privacy of their homes they speak Spanish."
"Police brutality has become such a large problem in today\u2019s society. There have been many controversial incidents that have involved unexplainable deaths in the media. Body cameras would be able to provide the public with evidence that proves police officer\u2019s innocence. Many cases that have occurred over time have challenged police officer\u2019s motives. The public questioned whether or not the police are actually here to protect the public. Police officers should wear body cameras to ensure other police officers and civilian\u2019s safety and well being."
"I remember one thing what my father asked me to remember all the time is \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone tell you what you can or can\u2019t do.\u201d And I always remember this thing when I\u2019m suffering from hard time I love him a lot. \u201cBut who I am with you, is who I really want to be. You\u2019re so good for me. When I am holding you, it\u2019s like I have the world in my hands. Yeah a better man is who I am with you.\u201d Quoted from the popular Chris Young song \u201cWho I am with you\u201d. The concept of love has been transformed into the idea that out of the billions of people on the planet, But for me my family has been the reason for love. Said individual is supposed to possess the ability to change the personality and actions of another human being purely based on the overwhelming affection they hold."
"Although the idea of affirmative action was implemented to give black people better opportunities it is still a form of discrimination. When an employer hires someone because he or she is a minority, even if someone else if more qualified to do the job, it is discrimination. Just because it is reverse discrimination, when whites are discriminated against and minorities are being discriminated for, doesn\u2019t make it right. \u201cAffirmative action legalizes discrimination\u201d. (Steele 1990)"
"These are the consequences of Muslim parents being to restrictive on their children, as their children can\u2019t be open with their parents and discuss real important issues in society, in which can benefit them in the future. Therefore the school teachers believe \u201cthat the girls\u2019 reticence and submissiveness was the consequence of lack of freedom\u201d. Basit, T (1997). Some Muslim parents gave their children some sort of freedom; however it was controlled, because whenever they could go out, the girls had to take someone older with them, and still not stay out late."
"The noises I heard when it happened. Unfamiliar screams that came out of my mouth. The glass of the windows shattered everywhere as if someone splashed a cup of water. My hair swung onto my face, like whips. Papa was sleeping while Mama was driving to the Father\u2019s Day festival in Arvada. It was so hot that day. Momo had his shirt open and , tired from the sleepover he had the day before, was sleeping just like his Papa. Karinna and I goofing off in the back."
"They were the ancestors of the people know today as Negritos or Aetas. The Mainland Origin Hypothesis by Peter Bellwood of the Australian National University and K.C. Chang of Harvard University maintains that the early inhabitants originated from South China and Taiwan. The other hypothesis, the Island Origin Hypothesis, believes that the prehistoric people originated and dispersed from an island in Southeast Asia. Historians presuppose that between 300 and 200 B.C. , inhabitants of Malay-Polynesians descent settled in the Philippine archipelago.There were 30-100 families in a society know as barangay. Tool assemblages,clothing,pottery,jewelry and the like are technological artifacts. These man-made objects illustrate the ability of man to respond to the condition to the environment."
"Coming to a completely different country, not knowing anyone at all, the first generation characters tend to be indignant. In both these novels the first generation immigrants express bitterness when adapting to different surrounding. Saroj Venturi from Serving Crazy with Curry, expresses her resentment towards the new culture, when she says \u201cIt was coming here, to this white pit that changed things between Avi and her. If they stayed in India, if only he\u2019d wanted to stay, they would\u2019ve been happy\u201d (Malladi, 15)."
"In contrast, the Hills which represent the fruit of human love which is a human person became an impossible dream or treated as a white elephant because of man\u2019s ignorance by defeating the purpose of life itself.\u00a0 If there will be no new persons there will also be no new families which mean that there will be no one to continue the great works of our civilizations."
"Stephen\u2019s paternal line can be traced seven generations back. The first person in his family to come to the United States was Aquila Chase who was born in England in 1620. He migrated to the United States during the puritan movement. His wife Anne Wheeler was born in Salisbury, England in 1621. Anne and her family came to the United States on the \u201cMary and John\u201d in 1634. Anne married Aquila Chase in Hampton by 1644. Aquila Chase was one of the first settlers in Hampton which is where he and Anne got married in 1644. While living in the Hamptons Aquila received many land grants and had more opportunity compared to others who came to the new world as indentured servants. (wiki tree) After several generations living on the east coast the Chase family moved to the west."
"I am fascinated on her patience with regards on dealing with both black and white kids, but more attention and care to the black child. I really felt the pain on Alma when she was pushed by a kid and bump her head and cried silently and felt alone and then came Ms. Paley to assist her. What I like about this book is that the author easily conveys her message in simple yet touching words. Easy to understand words are being used so any age could assess the essence of what she has written."

"No matter what side you are on everyone wants is to be as safe as possible. Abortion is defined as the \u201cremoval of the embryo or fetus from the uterus in order to end a pregnancy\u201d (Dictionary.com). Abortion is surrounded by many questions such as, Is a developing fetus really considered a being? Should the law allow abortions for rape or incest? What are the risk of having an abortion? What are other options?"
"What Boone and Yoast weren\u2019t aware of was the School Board had not expected Boone make it out of the two week training camp at the start of the season. After defying those odds and uniting the squad at camp, the School Board angrily put Boone\u2019s job on the line, saying if he lost one game he would be fired. From the very beginning of the movie until the state semifinal playoff game, Coach Boone\u2019s job is not expected to last."
"Securing the Unites States border between Mexico has been a developing matter through history since the Treaty of Guadalupe was signed in 1848 that allowed the acquisition of new territory and the Rio Bravo becoming the political border line between these two countries. Movement through this border has always been present, shifting in its increase due to economic hardships whether in Mexico or United States such as the bracero program where the U.S. requested help from Mexican farmers to work their lands due to shortage of labor because of their involvement in World War II [1]. However, Mexican immigration did not end once the war was done. President Eisenhower administration executed the Operation Wetback, \u201ca governmental campaign that forcibly repatriated 1 to 2 million Mexicans [whether undocumented or not]\u201d[2]. Despite the force, immigration from Mexico and Central America has yet continued. Before the 1990\u2019s, immigration crossings in the U.S \u2013 Mexico border had waves coming in through urban crossing points such as El Paso \u2013 Ciudad Juarez, San Diego \u2013 Tijuana, McAllen \u2013 Reynosa, etc. Nonetheless, the United States government implemented fence-buildings, closing off these urban crossings points, influencing a change of routes into dangerous points such as Arizona\u2019s desert[3]. With putting up barriers at these points, \u201cdeaths in the border region have increased nearly 150% as migrants enter through more remote and rugged terrain\u201d in the last decade and half [4]. Dead bodies of unknown immigrants have been found throughout these harsh geographic areas. As depicted in the picture, these graves show the sacrifice these immigrants will put their lives in[5]. The construction of this proposed wall, will unquestionably further the risks that immigrants will challenge when trying to cross to the United States, still placing themselves through deserts, underground tunnels, and even sea. These environmental situations have been counterproductive to the \u201csecuring\u201d, alternatively, creating inhumane barriers for immigrants whose goal is to have a better life on the other side of the border."
"Another theory is that Nefertiti was the Mitannian princess sent to Egypt for a diplomatic marriage, referred to as \u2018Tadhukhipa\u2019, this is supported as Nefertiti means \u201cthe beautiful woman has come\u201d. Nefertiti was Akhenaten\u2019s chief wife and it is clear that Akhenaten valued his beloved wife, in his tomb he referred to her as \u2018the mistress of his happiness\u2019, and according to C. Alfred on one of the boundary stelae at Amarna he describes her as \u201cFair of Face, Joyous with the Double Plume, Mistress of Happiness, Endowed with Favour, at hearing whose voice one rejoices, Lady of Grace, Great of Love, whose disposition cheers the Lord of Two Lands\u201d."
"The American Dream meant a better life for George, Lennie and Candy because they would live on their own ranch and not have anything to worry about. The dream would also mean companionship for Candy because he would not be lonely anymore because he would have George and Lennie to be with. In the end no one\u2019s dreams come true because loneliness ruins their lives. Loneliness kills Curley\u2019s wife, it gives Candy no future or security and for Crooks it gives him no hope because he will always be living in a racist society."
"Although throughout this poem, Duffy refers to the exploitation of childhood and presents the loss of innocence through male domination, it is also largely evident that the female character is very self-aware of the dangers and consequently uses her vulnerability to gain what she desires. This is exemplified by \u2018I made sure he spotted me/sweet sixteen never been\u2019. Although there is a great exaggeration of his dangerous novelty such as his \u2018big eyes\u2019 and \u2018teeth\u2019 which creates an uneasy emotion, the sibilance of \u2018sweet sixteen\u2019 instead reflects that she desires to appear seductive in an attempt to engage with the wolf."
"In the left section of the room there is a table set out for one, a train ticket with a destination \u2018To propose to Fiona\u2019, a large question mark drawn on the floor, a coffin draped in a black cloth with a rose on top, a vase of flowers, a bundle in a black cloth next to the coffin with a rose on top, a gravestone with no name or date, the words \u2018Dear Diary.. \u2018 written on the floor but with nothing following and on the floor, there was a white cloth.

"After the toilet debacle, she makes the symbolism vivid when she states, \u201cBut then I realize, like a shell cracking open in my head, there\u2019s no difference between those government laws and Hilly building Albileen a bathroom in the garage, except ten minutes\u2019 worth of signatures in the state capitol\u201d (92), Skeeter blatantly expresses here that the Jim Crow Laws she read have a strong correlation to the segregated bathrooms, marking the beginning of her tedious journey towards publishing the column to expose \u201cthe help\u201d perspective."
"The novel The Absolutely True Diary of a Part -Time Indian written by Sherman Alexie also displays the concept of how meeting people can impact our lives and change our perspective on how we perceive each other when we pursue the main character Junior. The book follows a fourteen-year-old boy, Arnold Spirit (Junior), living with his family on the Spokane Indian Reservation near Wellpinit, Washington for a school year. It is told in episodic diary style, moving from the start of the school year to the beginning of summer.

The wealthy man delivers the news of their son\u2019s death in a perverted and strange way, dragging it out to build tension."
"The source was quoted by an immigrant in 1949, so it was first hand and had not been passed on by different people. Source C supports what Miller is claiming with examples of notices, which makes the source more reliable. Source A does not say why it was quoted apart from it was published in a book 49 years later. From the source we can see that the black immigrants were limited to where they could stay and there was a lot of racism throughout landlords."

"Racial Caste System: It is a stratification where colored people are kept in inferior positions. It is a system that causes segregation amongst different ethnic groups (Color people and white people). White people are seen as the most inferior race within the society we live in. The roots of this system are to deny blacks their freedom and equality (Direct response to the civil rights movement). Racial Caste System predicts there\u2019s a likelihood of African American and black males ending up in federal or state prisons."
"The Baltimore riots, which occurred after the death of Freddie Gray, who died from law enforcement related injuries, were the violent actions of overwhelmed victims in black community\u2019s (). The constant oppression against blacks builds tension that eventually causes for one to react. African Americans demand respect and fair justice, which is almost embeddable when the race is constantly put down and frowned upon (). More and more African Americans are losing their lives due to the over aggressive manner in which they are dealt with by law enforcement. The negatives however can also be turned into positives. The loss suffered by the black community did not go unnoticed or unsupported by certain leaders of the world. President Obama used his powers to find justice for those who were wronged. He demanded new and improved policies which focused more on the safety of black civilians against law enforcement Q."
"Tocqueville will argue that this creates unsettled environment in the United States. In this essay, I will be arguing, Tocqueville\u2019s perspectives, opinions and predications on the United States to see if it was/is accurate, or one-sided. This will be done in a comparative, coherent argument to analyse argument compared with the current contemporary affairs of the United States. The purpose of this essay to use contemporary information to compare and contrast the current situations of both African-Americans and Native American in the United State to sees state of race relations, ethnic groups is still the same, has there been improvement or deterioration since Tocqueville\u2019s writing period."
"Immigration has its advantages and dis-advantages. Many people hold different views in regards to whether immigration is beneficial or not; these views will be expressed in this piece of writing. Immigration is somewhat beneficial to a country as immigrants can boost a countries economy. For example skilled and successful immigrants that reside in the UK pay taxes towards the running of the government therefore boost the economy. Highly educated immigrants are a benefit to a country as they can become things such as nurses, doctors, and teachers; this would benefit not only the country but the people of it."
"Also, imagine the emotional aspects of the child. The child would be thinking about how their birth parents were able to give them away. My husband and I talked over the financial aspect over it, and decided with help from various family members that we could survive. We would just have to make sacrifices within our everyday lives. During my sonogram appointment when I was four months pregnant I received another dose of bad news. At first the doctor saw what he thought were cysts on the brain. The doctor then told me that I should terminate the pregnancy because of the difficult life the child was about to go through."
"Upon a ghostly paradigm of things; Solider Aristotle played the taws Upon the bottom of a king of kings; World-famous golden-thighed Pythagoras Fingered upon a fiddle-stick or strings What a star sang and careless Muses heard: Old clothes upon old sticks to scare a bird. VII Both nuns and mothers worship images, But those the candles light are not as those That animate a mother\u2019s reveries, But keep a marble or a bronze repose. And yet they too break hearts \u2013 O Presences That passion, piety or affection knows, And that all heavenly glory symbolise \u2013 O self-born mockers of man\u2019s enterprise;"

"While the unemployment rate among French nationals stood at around 10% in 2000, it was about 20% among the foreign population. If one looks at the second generation of the immigrants, 26. 5% of university graduates of North African origin are unemployed, compared to 5% of graduates of French origin. Moreover, racism plays its role when choosing among candidates for work. According to SOS Racisme, a French campaigning group, CVs with an African name get far fewer positive answers than CVs with a typical French name."
"However, Jason\u2019s fortune is hard-earned because before finally getting his billions, he is required to accomplish a condition containing around twelve tasks or obligations which he needs to discover for himself and eventually do for others. As Jason started his journey, he unintentionally discovered the realities and lessons of life by inevitably experiencing the many gifts of life until he was finally faced with the ultimate gift which tells of the relationship between wealth and happiness (Stovall 19)."
"In 2011 The Federation of Children\u2019s Book Groups won the Eleanor Farjeon Award \u2013 an award given to an organization in recognition of excellent service to the world of British children\u2019s books. The Children\u2019s Book Circle and the Eleanor Farjeon committee presented the 2000 gift to the then Chair Adam Lancaster during an award ceremony. Receiving the award, Mr Lancaster spoke: \u201cEveryone involved in the Federation is a special person. They are the ones on the front line, working with tens of thousands of young people each year, doing those things that politicians and suited board men talk about. To be awarded this honor is to recognise all those people who over the years have played a part in igniting that spark and fanning those flames of reading. Books change lives. The Federation changes lives.\u201d"
"Throughout \u200bOthello\u200b, one can certainly view a strong imagery of racism that existed in Shakespeare\u2019s time; in other words, it is safe to note that Shakespeare wrote this play as a reflection of the racial issues that were occuring during the Elizabethan era. Based on the status of Othello as General, one can understand that no matter how noble an individual was, as long as their perceived to be Black, it was considered to be a good reason enough to be disrespected and practically dehumanized by society. Moreover, Shakespeare associating images of animals and witchcraft to represent Othello and African culture reveals the cruel side of the Elizabethan era, and how difficult life was for a black individual living in England during this time period. For this reason, Othello is a true illustration of Shakespeare\u2019s perception of racism in the Elizabethan era as well as the extreme racial prejudice against black people that used to exist."
"Stress caused by inadequate compensation at their job can create dissatisfaction for an employee. Giorgi, Shoes, & Leon-Perez provides research on the effects that an economic crisis can have on an employee. They described how economic stress can affect an employee\u2019s job satisfaction by stating \u201cemployees might decrease their commitment to the company because of a reduction in the number of opportunities to receive rewards or advance their careers\u201d (2015). Rewards and incentives provide employees a reason to work hard. Performing well and working hard constitutes a chance to receive a reward or incentive. If employees feel they cannot better themselves or receive rewards, their job satisfaction diminishes."
"Distressed students usually exhibit two types of behavior, including anger or disconnect. The angry behavior is more assertive and \u201cin your face\u201d whereas disconnect is more passive and \u201cleave me alone\u201d. The more aggressive behavior includes disobeying the teacher by talking back, using inappropriate body language and facial expressions. The student may appear to be out of control, lazy or \u201chaving an attitude.\u201d These behaviors are symptoms of stress disorders. In contrast, the passive behavior includes failing to respond to questions or request and slumping or disconnecting from peers or academic work. Uninformed teachers may think that poor low-income students slouch, slump and show little effort because of a learned behavior from their parents. However, research suggests that parents from low-income families work just as harder or even harder compared to those in middle and upper-class families. One reason many students may seem unmotivated or show little effort is due to a lack of hope and optimism. Low socioeconomic status and the accompanying financial hardships are correlated with depressive systems (Butterworth, Olesen, & Leach, 2012). Research from 60 high-poverty schools shows that the primary factor in student motivation and achievement is not the student\u2019s home environment, but rather the school and instructor (Irvin, Meece, Byun, Farmer, & Hutchins, 2011). Effort can be taught. Strong teachers do this every day."
"The rise of fragile families\u2014families that begin when a child is born outside of marriage\u2014is one of the nation\u2019s most vexing social problems. In the first place, these families suffer high poverty rates and poor child outcomes. Even more problematic, the very groups of Americans who traditionally experience poverty, impaired child development, and poor school achievement have the highest rates of non-marital parenthood\u2014thus intensifying the disadvantages faced by these families and extending them into the next generation."
"Most people do not see that racism is an issue, but racism is a huge problem in society. Racism has caused a lot of pain and destruction throughout history as it is to blame for most of the hate in our society. There are many possible solutions to reduce racism and limit the negative effects such as government regulations, better education, and create more awareness. Recently, there has been a new illness called COVID-19, it can affect your lungs and airways."
"The crime rate in Miami has caused much separation in the difference and quality of living for people in Miami, as one travels down the Dolphin Expressway, people can notice a culture change in which areas are not in shabby condition by illegal activities. One of the unique tools the Miami-Dade police department allows residents to do is use the crime mapping program that helps empower the community by putting valuable public safety information at the community\u2019s fingertips."
"This system works in this way-it takes in water through the rim present in the bottom of their bell. Once this water has been taken in the muscles squeeze the water out. These muscles are usually only one-cell thick and not very strong.so their locomotion pathways are merely controlled by them and is majorly controlled by the water currents."
"In February 1838 Angelina became the first American women to address a legislative body. In May 1838, Angelina married abolitionist Theodore Weld in Philadelphia; their ceremony had sexual equality and attended by blacks and whites. Sarah lived with Angelina and Theodore for the remainder of her life. They helped write Theodore\u2019s American Slavery As It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses. In the 1840\u2019s and 1850\u2019s The Grimke sisters and Theodore started schools at Belleville and then at a community near Perth Amboy. In 1862 they all moved to Faimount near Boston. In 1870 the sisters joined a group of women in an attempt to vote in a a local election. Sarah Grimke died at the age of 81 in December of 1873. Angelina, who had been paralyzed for several years because of strokes, died on October 26, 1879. Theodore Weld survived until 1895. All three had lived to see the end of slavery and the rise of a women\u2019s rights movement."
"\u201cCulture Clash\u201d is the act when one or more cultures are incorporated into one environment and as a result, traditions are challenged causing a disruption. First generation characters share the traits of being indignant of changing cultural values during immigration while the second generation are keen on conforming and leave their roots in exchange for freedom of being accepted into society. Through the characters and use of language, both Monica Ali\u2019s Brick Lane and Amulya Malladi\u2019s Serving Crazy with Curry demonstrates how immigration creates a difference in identity that exists between the first and second generation."
"These extracts are what structure Rona and Cassie\u2019s holiday; their dependency upon these useless sources shows the lack of direction they have in their lives. The guidebook they use entitled, \u201cPotted France\u201d is relevant in expressing that the characters are \u201cpotted\u201d; they do not appear whole and feel they are missing something from their lives. Primarily they lack identity. The introduction of these extracts, reinforce the degree of fragmentation suffered by these characters. However, it is only one of the many jigsaw like qualities of Rona and Cassie, who appear fragmented in every respect. The frequent use of the structure:"
"This was because the factory held steam driven power looms. This was thought to have been a very dumb thing to do as then the workers had no were else to work they were unemployed. The Luddites were named that because they followed a man called Ned Ludd no one really knows whether he is real or not he was thought to have been fictitious and made up to scare the masters of the factories. The Luddites warned them about things like \u201cif you don\u2019t get rid of your new machines we will trash the place and burn it down\u201d. But the government took a firm hand on the matter and passed a law which said that people would be hanged if they were caught smashing machines."
"A study at the University of Indiana also indicated that 14 percent of phishing scams are successful which contradicts the Gartner report which indicates only a three percent success rate. The Gartner research also found out that financial losses from phishing scams were $137 million in 2004 rising to $2. 8 billion in 2006 (ITRC, 2007). The fight against identity theft may be considered rather ineffective since law enforcement personnel lack the necessary resources to combat such a crime which is computer-related."
"The subject of my presentation is Having good manners is important to everyone especially in today\u2019s society. It should not matter whether a person is at home, work, or just hanging out with friends; manners are always important in all that a person does. Your manners are important all of the time. It is possible to manners in the way a person walks, talks."
"There thus existed need to establish a clear link between family economy and alcoholism. About a third of alcoholics recover whether they are in treatment program or not, Vallant, (as cited in Santrock, 2005). Studies from the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism (NIAAA) in United States of America indicate that of all drugs, withdrawal from alcohol differs most significantly. This is so because it can be directly fatal, with an alcoholic having no serious situations having a significant risk of dying from the direct effect of withdrawal if not managed properly."
"Their poverty, and the consequent lack of opportunity to rise above their socio-economic situation, not to mention the huge impact of the overall economic structuring of New York City where many have chosen to take up residence, have made them succumb to the drug dealing culture or way of living that has become so entrenched. In effect, even if social inequalities play a decisive role in their fates, these undereducated, marginalized youngsters unwittingly become their own driving forces that seal their own destinies and administer their own eventual ruin."
"In my opinion, African American males who come from a single-parent home where the father was not presented from their early childhood up until their adolescent years, often wind up making the worse decisions. Most troubled children turn to the streets, join gangs, and as David Dow stated commit violent crimes. David Dow made a great point about not only how these inmates\u2019 death penalty could have been prevented, but how the crime they committed could have been prevented."
"For the natural setting observation study the researchers cannot talk to whoever they are observing which can lead to involvement towards the study and interrupting the natural behavior. To make sure this type of research study is ethical is to not use names and make sure other people cannot find these participants in their community. Or they can tell their participants that they want to observe them, but not tell them when and do the observation randomly. Overall identity formation can be manipulated at anytime in the child\u2019s development stages; media, magazines, and their own peer group can change how they view themselves."
"involves therapeof a 5-year old child. Theaccused was meted the penalty of death because rape committed against a \u00b6child below seven (7) years old\u00b7 is a dastardly and repulsive crime which merits no less than the imposition of capitalpunishment under Article 266-B of theRevised Penal Code. The sentence was also reducedtoreclusion perpetua, without the possibility ofparole."
"Individual rights are legal entitlements, for example, the right to education, the right to freedom of speech, and the right to choose. In health and social care an example of individual rights service users have are the right to individuality, security, dignity, respect, privacy, and individual needs being met regardless of their age, gender, ethnic origin, sexual preference, economic status, or religious beliefs (prezi.com). Service provider must promote individual rights as it can be empowering to service users and make the more independent. For example, a care worker must actively promote individual rights of their service user in order to maintain quality practise. Service users have the right to make complex decisions for them and must always be consulted on matters that will affect them, if a carer makes a decision makes decisions for a service user without gaining their input, this would then be in violations of the service uses individual rights. When a service user is deciding on what treatment to opt for a carer should provide them with required information, but allow them to make the choice. Essentially, a carer should be assisting the service user to maintain their lifestyle by providing the necessary care, rather than the service user alternating their lifestyle to fit in with how the care setting is run (markedbyteachers.com). The benefits of promoting individual rights are to recognise the importance for all service users to retain their independence and encourage service users to act and think as an individual. This will help individuals throughout their life and give them a sense of independence and not always having to depend on someone when doing day to day tasks."
"A nursing practice with greater emphasis on primary and non-secondary prevention will be defined; in collective prevention and not in individual; in polyvalent prevention rather than specific, and that is focused on the attention to the healthy family in their social and community life, and then go on to sickness, disability and social dysfunction, finally attending to treatment, healing and rehabilitation."
"In many religious beliefs, the major representation of a wicked spirit, ruler of Hell, and rival of God is of course the Devil. His power to distress human beings both with physical illness and with spiritual corruption is mysterious. However, the idea of a guy with such power and understanding has been used in stories and films alike. In Joyce Carol Oates\u2019 short story, \u201cWhere Are You Going, Where Have You Been?\u201d Oates depicts Arnold Pal as the Devil; we can see this through his physical description, strange seduction, and his supernatural understanding of Connie."
"Film techniques such as point-of-view shots, panning, voice over and screen text help the audience see the intense racial tension that existed Alexandra, Virginia at the time. The setting helped the viewers understand how bad the racism and inequality was in the team and the struggles that the players overcame to form a winning team."
"In the book \u201cOf Mice & Men\u201d the two main characters are George and Lennie. The setting of the story seems to be set back in the early 1900\u2019s or the late 1800\u2019s by the dialect they use. The two characters have a unique relationship. The first character is a small quick man with strong features his name is George. The other man is very large with a shapeless face and is also quite slow his name is Lennie. Throughout the story these two characters complement each other fairly nicely."
"When we cross the near extinction carbon 500 ppm tipping point in about 25 to 30 years (about 2040\u2019s), our average global temperature will inescapably soar to at least 4\u00b0C (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit). At 4\u00b0C, all ice on earth will begin melting as it has done repeatedly in the past, sea levels will eventually rise about 240-270 feet, and a large portion of humanity (as much as 30-60%) will die of starvation, or from rising temperatures and global warming\u2019s other related consequences. At carbon 500 ppm many struggling or weakened governments and societies will collapse in many areas of the world."
"Naturalization Act of 1790 restricted citizenship to free Whites. Congress passed the Civilization Act of 1819 to take in the Native Americans. This law provided United States government funds to support Protestant missionary educators in order to convert Native Americans to Christianity. In 1863, President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation as the nation approached the third year of the civil war which declared, \u201call persons held as slaves\u201d within the rebellious states \u201care, and henceforward shall be free."
"In the presidential elections of November 1860, the victory of the Republican Lincoln \u2013 acquired from the conceptions of the Northern States \u2013 was the spark that ignites the fire, after years of rising tensions between these two development models. The War lasted from April 12, 1861 to April 9, 1865. It resulted in the death of more than 600,000 soldiers, the assassination of President Lincoln on April 15, 1865 and a victory for the North paving the way for the abolition of slavery."
"One may believe that it is family and social class is the root of your personality. An example of this maybe found through the literature of Tony Harrison, a great poet and playwright found in the twentieth century era. A number of his poetic developments mainly reside on the subject of his journey from the working class, onto an education at Leeds University which allowed him to prosper in the field of linguistics. An example of this is found in the poem \u201cThen\u201d and \u201c[uz]\u201d."
"Left alone with these thoughts, Othello states \u201cI\u2019d whistle her off Also Lesvos her down the wind/to prey at fortune). As much expressions recommended that Assuming that Desdemona might have been turned out false, he might throws her crazy about as much family. However, following he acquires up the issue of his own race Also distinguishes how he is unique in relation to whatever remains of society, Othello lashes out in outrage toward Desdemona, the substitute to as much overwhelming sense from claiming self-loathing:. Haply, to I am bootleg. What\u2019s more have not the individual\u2019s delicate parts from claiming discussion. That clamberers have, alternately to I am declined. Under the vale for quite some time (yet that\u2019s not much). She\u2019s run. I am abused: Also my easing. Othello doesn\u2019t simply reprimand Desdemona to her unfaithfulness or censures her to her sins, Be that as he, to a way, supports her activities Eventually Tom\u2019s perusing accepting that as much own race-related Shortcomings persuaded her will need an undertaking for in turn mamoncillo. This quote reveals to a change previously, Othello. He starts should loathe Desdemona a result he Right away puts stock that she cheated on him due to as much race. He won\u2019t make substance for only tossing her out, yet will be presently devoured for despising a result he puts stock her deceiving Furthermore separation need created him on feel agony What\u2019s more subpar quality."
"The Montreal police define a street gang as \u2018a group of individuals, usually adolescents and/or young adults, who use the power of group intimidation in order to carry out, on a more or less regular basis, violent criminal acts\u2019 (as cited in Chan and Mirchandani, pp. 116). Police documentation had identified five ethnic groups where street gangs originated (as cited in Chan and Mirchandani, 2002, pp. 117). Among the five is the Asiatic ethnic group (as cited in Chan and Mirchandani, 2002, pp. 117)."
"113). Domestic abuse is physical or sexual abuse that happens to a partner, whether they are men or women young or old that is carried out with or without a weapon. Battering or domestic violence may be defined as physical attacks that are committed by spouses, ex-spouses, boyfriend, girlfriend, ex-boyfriend or girlfriend that include assaults where there is serious injury or minor injury as expressed by Birzer and Etter (2007) (pg. 114)."
"I don\u2019t know where you got it from, but in the end, it\u2019s going to kill you\u201d (52) Sedaris shared this story to show that overprotective parents, such as his father, can do more harm than good. Even though they typically mean well and just want to keep their children safe, they often are instilling fear in their children. By doing this, they are damaging their child and setting them up for a messed up life. He also tells this story to show that even parents can be hypocritical. Parents should be able to practice whatever it is they are preaching. If they are teaching their kids something, it should be reasonable enough that they do it, too. \u201cCyclops\u201d by David Sedaris is full of great life lessons, humorous anecdotes, and well thought out writing. He does an excellent job of using his writing tone to guide the reader through the structure of his short story. He does an equally, if not better, job of carrying the reader through the story with him and giving them the same realizations he was having at the time. Although much of \u201cCyclops\u201d is not particularly relatable to most, the message about parents that it gives most certainly is."
"Malachi\u2019s Cove on the other hand was set in Victorian England. Mally (short for Mahala) lived with her grandfather in a cottage on the Northern coast of Cornwall between Tintagel and Bossiney. Old Glos (Mally\u2019s grandfather) had lived and worked here for many years, earning his living by saving seaweed from the waves and selling it for manure."
"can say that to talk in a \u201cconyo\u201d way is part of the Filipino students\u2019 culture, especially those who are in the \u201chigher ups\u201d in our society. But looking on the brighter side of it, I noticed that this \u201cconyo\u201d talk shows how intelligent the Filipinos are. It may sound annoying, but only the Filipinos can do that to talk with each other using a combination of two languages. They can position themselves more easily without fear of retaliation or ridicule as well as express solidarity, difference and/or power similar to everyday interactions or the hybridity-of-the-everyday."
"One quote shows how Curley\u2019s wife threatens him and Crooks sits down and doesn\u2019t fight back, \u201cCrooks had reduced himself to nothing. There was no personality, no ego-nothing to arouse either like or dislike\u201d. Steinbeck tries to use metaphorical language to show that Crooks doesn\u2019t want to be seen and that he fears for himself. It also shows that he is at the bottom of the social hierarchy mainly because he is the only black person on the ranch. The"
"If\u00a0I\u00a0didn\u2019t comply with the legislation it\u00a0could result in\u00a0being prosecuted, being fined or\u00a0result in\u00a0losing my\u00a0job. We\u00a0have this legislation to\u00a0safeguard ourselves and other around\u00a0us in\u00a0the workplace it\u00a0to\u00a0prevent anyone from getting harmed if\u00a0we\u00a0don\u2019t follow legislation. We\u00a0would have to\u00a0be\u00a0held accountable for our actions it\u2019s bringing the organization you work for into disrepute."
"Another lonely character was Crooks the stable buck. Crooks is an even lonelier character than Candy, because not only is he a cripple, like Candy, but he is also black. Most of the men have a lot of prejudice against Crooks, referring to him with derogatory terms such as \u2018nigger\u2019. And because he is a different colour, he has to stay in a room on his own. Crooks is yet another victim of the times. We are told by Candy that the Boss takes his anger out on Crooks, though Crooks does nothing wrong. And Candy also relates an incident in the past when one of the ranch hands picked a fight with Crooks. It is to Crooks\u2019 credit that he won the fight, although the other man did have his feet tied."
"Academic and Career Goals Sometimes it seems like life is inhibiting me from achieving my goals. I define my objectives as I see them. I associate them with my values. Knowing that the task at hand is essential to realizing my dreams, but I am unable to do it. I have thought about other ways to get around the problem, I keep getting back to the talent I\u2019m missing. Accomplishing a new ability might feel like a huge undertaking. It\u2019s been my experience that if a talent is necessary in getting closer to achieving my dreams, education is not a bad thing after all."
"Just to name few of them; also the health services treating injured ones, those funding to organisations and charities that support victims of domestic violence. I choose this quote because it expresses the pure and popular reality in different communities: Domestic violence in families affect children physically, psychological and emotionally and this can lead to children in their adult life developing deviant behaviour. In the community sometimes abusive person in a family can cause nuisance to neighbours such fighting or making noise while destabilising the members of its own family. Domestic violence appears to be a cause and a result of gender inequality thus as long as this tackled the whole society would be always affected by this issues. The perpetrator of domestic violence most of the time seems to affirm its power on the victim. Domestic violence does not mean only physical abuses It can take a very discrete form such excessive controlling behaviour over an individual to constrain them to obey to their orders\u201d (Zimmerman; C. E.)."
"Shakespeare reserves some of the best dialogues for his warring lovers, especially Oberon and Titania, and even the \u201crude mechanicals\u201d manage to wow us with their clever banter. Deception and disguise: Hermia and Lysander try to sneak away from Athens to elope (behind Egeus\u2019s back). Also, Titania and the young lovers have no idea they\u2019ve been drugged by Oberon and his magic love juice. Mistaken identity: Titania mistakes Bottom for a creature who is worthy of her love and affection. The same can be said of the other lovers who are dosed with Oberon\u2019s magic love potion. Multiple plots with twists and turns: There are several lines of action in A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream and Shakespeare invites us to sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride. The first plot involves Theseus and Hippolyta\u2019s upcoming wedding. The second plot line involves the young Athenian lovers who run around the wood in confusion. The third plot follows Oberon\u2019s tiff with his wife, Titania."
"Since Juliet has rejected her father\u2019s proposal, Capulet is shocked and furious because Juliet has never been a disobedient daughter to her parents which is now the first time that she has disobeyed him, \u2018Hang thee, young baggage! Disobedient wretch! I tell thee what: get thee to church o\u2019 Thursday. Or never after look me in the face.\u2019 This threat, because it is realistic, is more frightening to Juliet than the earlier threats to drag her to church. A father could bring enormous pressure on his daughter to marry the man he had chosen for her. He could not have forced her to say \u2018I do.\u2019 On the other hand, he could easily make her life miserable by shunning her and making her an outcast in his house. He shouted, \u2018God\u2019s bread! It makes me mad! Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play, To have her match\u2019d,\u2019 Capulet is angry because his daughter doesn\u2019t appreciate all the effort he has put in for her."
"As the two men are trying to escape from a mishap that Lennie is in fault for, George like always tries to back him up. George and Lennie met one day when George was talking to his friends and told Lennie to jump off of a bridge that they were both on."
"Capital trials are separated into two sections, in the first only evidence and defenses are heard, this is referred to as the guilt phase. At the close of the guilt phase while the jury does not yet deliberate about a sentence, they do however decide to convict or acquit the defendant. Should the defendant be convicted, the penalty phase of the trial begins, during this phase the jury hears arguments and evidence concerning sentencing options. At this time, prosecutors will argue for a death sentence and must present aggravating factors associated with the crime. They will also attempt to stir the jury away from feelings of sympathy for the defendant, by stating past criminal charges or lack of remorse about the crime. In contrast, defense lawyers will argue against the death penalty, trying to persuade the jury to sentence their clients to life imprisonment instead."
"In contrast with Ritchie\u2019s findings that the crimes committed by women offenders were related to race and ethnic discriminations, Steffensmeier and Allan disputed the findings arguing that larceny-theft increases are due most likely to shoplifting increases, which is misdemeanor, and connected with the roles of women as family custodian and consumers. Steffensmeier and Allan uphold their view that the most significant changes in women\u2019s offending reveals that the rise of large shopping centers enhanced the opportunities to commit petty crimes such as stealing goods and misuse credit cards and so forth, which are generally attributed to female traditional roles."
"Her parents are totally unaware of her love for Romeo, so without asking, naturally assume that she mourns Tybalt\u2019s death. In Act 3 Scene 5, Lady Capulet pays an unaccustomed visit to Juliet in her bedroom, again showing her distance from her daughter. Instead of offering sympathy, Lady Capulet plainly tells her to stop her mourning:"
"Sharon had pushed Jason to find this abandoned child of his, and at the time, cheerfully embraced the adoption of Eng, believing it to be a fresh start with Jason\u2019s children. She had even strived to furnish and decorate the children\u2019s room in preparation. However, further down the line, things seemed to have taken a turn for the worse, and now both of them can\u2019t stand each other\u2019s presence, and possibly feel jealous about their particular bond with Jason. Sharon seems convinced that Eng manipulates Jason, who becomes gullible whenever his daughter is concerned, and also believes that Eng needs counselling or even psychological help. She is noted to have changed, as her cheerful and accepting demeanour has shifted to stubborn and distraught with Eng\u2019s frequent tantrums, deliriums and apparent self-harm through her heathen \u2018money cure\u2019, so much so that Dr Kearns had to give her a mild sedative to calm her down."
"America needs to find ways to live with immigrants because \u201cunity through diversity\u201d will strengthen American culture. In looking to other reasons for the criminalization of immigration, one also has to note the fear of competition in the hearts of Americans. Although many Americans support free enterprise and healthy competition, there are also a group of Americans who feel threatened by the incoming flow of labor into the country. Some of these Americans want to hold onto their jobs and the status quo at any cost, even if it means the rejection of certain people from their country."
"So, as one looks back on American history, what if General Robert E. Lee had never existed? Certain circumstances might have simply accelerated history, as to be expected when one literally removes the single most important man to the losing army in a war situation, but taking a deeper look at what might have occurred in the Civil War reveals an interesting timeline."
"And now, I am going to discuss the useful of Google search engine first. The most basic search results and the three main features that I am pointing it out about Google search engine was Anytime, Nearby, and Reading Level. For the basic, when I typed \u201cMechanical Engineering\u201d into the search box, then I got a long list of results instantly, which was about 143,000,000 results."
"The VA\u2019s Caregiver help program has a budget of $330 million, eighty% of that is used for stipends to offer economic support to caregivers (Kesling, 2014). The stipends variety from $500 up to $2,six hundred a month (McCarthy, 2014). The U.S. branch of Veterans Affairs expected that nationally three,596 veterans will qualify for the duration of this system\u2019s first year, costing approximately $69 million (McCarthy, 2014). One drawback to funding this system, is who is eligible to receive this investment. at the same time as one person may additionally receive the stipend, any other might not qualify to obtain investment despite the fact that they served and have a devastating injury. Chris Ott is based on the $2000 a month stipend to take care of her injured son, at the same time as Pauline King whose husband is a Vietnam Veteran gets no stipend. that is in component because of the fact that once lawmakers created the program in 2010, it limited participation to veterans who had served because the September eleventh terrorist assaults (Kesling, 2014). even as investment is to be had, not every body can get hold of it."
"Justification of directly motivation and obtain abortion for any reason whatsoever will cause the abuse of the definite very important which also states thus: \u2018Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never as a means only\u2019."
"In this article, Hughes explains the hanging of Australian\u2019s last man; Ronald Ryan and how after 40 years, Ryan has been declared innocent. The author had used information coming from Ryan\u2019s former accomplice as well as information from the trial in 1967 and more recent forensic information to uncover the mystery that has been ongoing for the last 40 years as to whether Ronald Ryan really did kill a prison guard or not. The article focuses on informing the public of the decision made by the Australian Government which has been proven to be wrong."
"He dead knowing that the sacrifices he made give his children the further he has envisioned for them. The father sacrificed so much for the sake of his children, his dreams, his marriage, and even his life. \u201cIt was very much braver to spend a life doing what you really do not want rather than selfishly following forever your own dreams and inclinations. \u201d (409). Perhaps now he well finally and truly has some peace and quiet with his books in that ever-ready chair of his."
"Is it right to say a man with wealth and power can do whatever he wants? From the viewpoint of the novel \u201cMontana 1948\u201d, the answer is absolutely no. The novel has drawn a picture of Hayden family, the most respectful and dominating family in town, being thrown to chaos just because of the crime a family member committed. Even though two main characters in this novel, Frank and Wesley, share some similarities from their childhood environment, the three main contrasts between them lead them to different endings."
"The poem \u201cI Am\u201d by John Clare is about how he wants to escape all people and emotion and find solitude, he believed he would find this in nature, \u201cI long for scenes where man hath never trod.\u201d The poem was written was written just before he escaped his insane asylum, he felt confined there and needed wide open spaces which he managed to find. To Clare, nature is a friend as it offers what he needs and wants the most; solitude and simplicity similar to that which he experienced in childhood, \u201csleep as I in childhood sweetly slept, untroubling and untroubled as I lie.\u201d Clare also wanted to be with God and nature would connect him to God as nature is God\u2019s creation as are people, \u201cTo abide with my Creator God.\u201d Nature is a friend here as it was the only way that Clare was able to escape and be at peace."
"The point of view of James is also seen in this chapter; James recall that he sees her mother as different at such an early age, although he really cannot fully comprehend why in fact she is different from others. This is highlighted in the account when James already reaches kindergarten; he asks his mother why she is different from him, although her mother refuses to entertain the question (McBride, n. pag. ). Her bitter memories regarding her family influences her not to open the topic later in her life, soon to be understood by James."
"The House of People\u2019s Representatives is composed of 460 members, of whom 360 are elected by the people to five-year terms and the remainder are appointed by the president. In theory presidential policies are subject to approval by the house, but it is actually a rubber-stamp parliament whose elected members represent primarily an alliance of special-interest groups. These groups are mobilized into the government party, called Golkar, and two other parties reflecting Muslim, Christian, and nationalist interests."
"Moreover, Roman dog policies are relaxed when it comes to eating out with your dog. Majority of the eating-places and pubs in Rome open their doors for dogs with some offering adequate out-door space when the weather allows. There are plenty of fun things for dog lovers including beautiful dog gardens within the city centre and the strategic Bau Beach."
"Seals let Gammage borrow his brand new Jaguar to pick his mother up in Pittsburgh. While driving through downtown Pittsburgh Gammage got out of the car and began to argue with the officers. He allegedly was beaten to death by them. What makes it ironic is the only reason Gammage was stopped is because he was riding his brakes to prevent from speeding. {Daher 1} A tow tuck driver named Frank Beljack was a eyewitness to the beating. Beljack said I noticed they were hitting on him. It looked like one of the officers was on his back hitting him. The officers are on trial now for involuntary man slaughter. {Daher 2} Although police beatings like this have no logical explanation why they happen, some cops have described a feeling of excitement during a high speed pursuit. This feeling now has a name.It is called High-Speed Pursuit Syndrome. High-Speed Syndrome is described as a mix between fear, excitement, and adrenaline. This syndrome cause the officer to vent all these emotions on the suspect at the end of the pursuit.{A.C.L.U. 1} Police departments now are training their officers how to control their emotions in the event of a high speed chase.{A.C.L.U. 2} Three of the four police beatings above involved high speed pursuits. The purpose of this research paper is took look at some police brutality cases and try to determine how big of a problem it is. This is just four cases of thousands of cases all over the world. So the answer is police brutality is a big problem and should be stopped by whatever means necessary."
"Max Webers theory saw class as important when forming an identity. Weber saw class as a group of individuals who have certain interests in common; this\u00a0is known as market position, for example having similar opportunities for earning income through work or trade. Weber recognised that status is also important within social groups. Status is the different amounts of prestige, honour or social standing that is attached to different social groups. So where we live, manner of speech, our schooling and leisure habits decide our social class. This would suggest maybe status could have as much influence on identity as class. Webers theories would suggest that although, like Marx, agreed that different classes exist, Status was the key factor in deciding our identities and which group we belong to."
"Identity is an intrinsic idea of one\u2019s life. Whilst there are no certainties, the struggle of identity often happens, and the conflicts may depend on the individual himself. The conflict may occur due to various factors in one\u2019s identities including their sexual orientations, skin colour and religious background. These variables may cause noticeable damages to one\u2019s mentality and psychology, and hence lead the individual to struggle with who they are. Individuals with homosexual preferences often experience conflicts in terms of their identities."
"Waverly says that she can do whatever she wants, she is her own person and no one can control her. Hearing this Lindo began to think that her daughter is become so independent. Her independence connects to her American culture because this culture gives everyone freedom and in Chinese culture the children must obey their parents."
"However, from 1984 arms were imported annually in the year 2000, the government\u2019s import bill for arms was around $US 274 million (constant 1990), the highest reported spending on weapons during the war period. Spending on military activities in Sri Lanka is greater than that of many countries in the South Asian region (such as India, Bangladesh and Nepal). Similarly the number of defense personnel increased by close to tenfold from 22,000 in 1989 to 213,000 in 2008. It is estimated that the accumulated loss from 1983 to 1996 to be equivalent to over 160 percent of the GDP in 1996 using a constant interest rate of 5 percent (Ganegodage,2013). The direct costs include reduction in nonmilitary expenditure and damage to infrastructure while the major portions of indirect costs consist of income loss from foregone investment, reduced tourism and loss of human capital through death and injury, displacement of people and output forgone in the war zone. The war significantly reduced the investment flow into the country and therefore concluded that the war could have long run implications for the country\u2019s economy."
"For centuries those of Caucasian decent have been given legal and social privileges that other races must fight in order to receive equal rights. White Americans are granted the coveted privileges in education, finance, immigration, voting, citizenship, businesses, land, and criminal justice. The slave trade has played a major role in the economic development of America and it has shaped the identity of those in hierarchy who has passed down their beliefs from generation to generation."
"The art work he used for his thesis used the Puritan discourse when showing children as \u2018smaller adults\u2019 showing them as toned and muscular. This could be seen as adults not having love for children that they deserved and needed, and yet with the high infant mortality rates that existed at the time they were painted, every child would have been treasured and cared for in the best possible way. Yet, Aries theories are still used to this day as a key place to start when looking at the social constructionist\u2019s view of childhood."
"It is due to the direct and indirect effects of these policies, Gladys and Nan deny their children knowledge of their aboriginal backgrounds. If the children knew and a word got out, the family might be torn apart. As mothers they feared that their children might suffer the same fate as Arthur, Daisy and Gladys, all of whom had been uprooted and exploited by whites for no other reason than they were Aboriginal."
"Grand theories describe and explain large segments of the human experience which are very broad. Middle-range theories explain more specific phenomena such as stress, self-care, health promotion and infant attachment. Metatheory is a term used to label theory about the theoretical process and theory development (Polit & Beck 2008:141). Metaparadigm refers to the main concepts that identify the phenomena or ideas of interest to a discipline, in this case the discipline of nursing. They provide the boundaries for the subject matter of the discipline."
"One good quote that shows Lennie thinking like a child is when George says they will heat the beans up and have supper. Lennie replies, \u201cI like beans with ketchup.\u201d George replies to this shouting at him to go and fetch some wood for the fire. \u201cWell, we ain\u2019t got no ketchup. You go get wood. An\u2019 don\u2019t you fool around. It\u2019ll be dark before long.\u201d The \u201cAn\u2019 don\u2019t you fool around\u2026\u201d section of the quote is very ironic because when Lennie goes off to search for the firewood George hears a splash down the river in the direction Lennie had taken. When Lennie returns he has only one piece of firewood so George instantaneously knows that Lennie has found another mouse, \u201cGi\u2019me that mouse.\u201d This again associates Lennie with being a child as he has been distracted from what he originally set out to do."
"Another hack is to set up diaper changing stations at different locations in the house so you don\u2019t have to run a marathon every time baby does her business and get ready they do a lot of it. You can set up a basket containing wipes, new diapers, a set of clean clothes (to change the soiled ones), diaper rash cream."
"Both wife and husband manages their situation differently, which creates more diversion within the couple. The husband admits his lack of understanding between him and his wife. He wants to create an arrangement to not force the other one to speak out the truth, However, there should be a mindset present to share their misconceptions and secrets without any tension, rather than feeling distrusted."
"While I accept that this may be the case in some instances, I find it very difficult to see this as the main, contributing factor. Apart from our rainbow nation image, South Africa has a reputation for being the land of possibilities. Where other countries may turn a blind eye to the suffering in other parts of the world, leaders like"
"Authoritarian parenting focuses on the child\u2019s obedience to the rules and regulations they set and not responding to the child\u2019s wants or demands. Authoritarian parenting styles obtained a negative impact in Western literature, primarily because of the negative child and adolescent\u2019s behaviour. Parenting styles among Asian countries (particularly in China) have been variously described as authoritarian, controlling, restrictive and hostile (Lin & Fu, 1990; Steinberg, Dornbusch, & Brown, 1992). In contrast, (Baumrind, 1972), found a positive effect on authoritarian parenting style resulting in independence or self-assertiveness of the children. In Chen, Dong, and Zhou (1997) study found that authoritarian parenting has a positive effect on aggression, and have a negative effect on sociability-competence and peer acceptance in second-grade children from Beijing, China."
"This makes Lancey out to be an arrogant character as he does not appriciate the language of the country that he is in nor does he come across as a friendly, warm character. Lancey\u2019s character is built-up further through stage directions. He is described to be a very organised, militaristic man who is excellent at his job but has weak communication skills with people,"
"Moving on to situation ethics, this theory is in favour of reproductive technology if it is the most loving course of action in the particular situation. It is not absolutist. This theory says that individual situations are different. This theory believes that there is only one underlying principle: you do whatever is the most loving thing to do in a situation. Ethical rules are secondary. In the circumstances of an infertile couple you take the line of action which will be the most loving thing for a couple in their unique circumstances."
"English notes that this parallel of self-defense is most useful when looking at the situation from the pregnant woman\u2019s point of view. She admits to some fault in looking at a two person scenario as this would imply that the woman is performing the abortion. This is where English brings in the doctor as the third party in the scenario. She concludes that considering a third party would tend to be more supportive of abortion, since as a passerby, one would probably help the person in the fight if they had a personal connection with or help the one who brings most value to society. She proposes both of these scenarios with aiding your husband \u201cwhether he was attacker or victim, \u201d and a famous violinist attacking a bum."
"As the world is fast being transformed into a global village, traditional classes based on feudal or religious systems are changing in structure to those of economic or political classes. However, social classes retain their importance as determinants of the actions of all members in a large majority of the societies of the world. References -01 Bell, D. , A. , 1992, Faces at the bottom of the well: The Permanence of Racism."
"Federal abortion laws do generally allow abortion procedures to take place, however there are certain requirements set up by each state. For instance, forty-two states in the United states do require a licensed physician to perform an abortion, while nineteen states require that an abortion be performed after an exact point in pregnancy in a hospital setting only. Policies like these are what start to set boundaries and limits to abortion."
"In similarity to \u2018Mrs Tiresias\u2019, Duffy has thread through ideas about the menstrual cycle in \u2018Queen Kong\u2019. The use of the menstrual cycle in \u2018Queen Kong\u2019 with \u201cI bled when a fat, red moon rolled on the jungle roof\u201d is used to reinforce the extent of her passion for the man, and the following line \u201cand after that, I decided to get him back\u201d illustrates how a period changes a woman\u2019s behaviour, which is an idea similarly presented in \u2018Mrs Tiresias\u2019 with the fact that \u201cThen he got his period\u201d stands as a one-lined stanza."
"This studies paper deals with the subject matters of marital violence and its effetcs on the institute of marriage and society. Marital violence is likewise termed under home violence. It may be either abuse, violent conduct or rage via one individual towards some other in a domestic placing such as home. It can be of religious, emotional, physical, sexual or verbal form. This violence has a deep mental and social effect on both the ladies suffering and the institutes of the society. Marital violence can purpose long term mental problems no longer best to the women however also to their children and their domestic. This violence can lead to girls leaving their home and going again to their Homeland. Also, it is able to hurt the psyche of children who see their parents abusing each other. Marital violence in African literature may be visible as an escape for the guys to hold their hegemony over his house antique. Many a time women dealing with marital violence go through in Silence because of few motives those may be due to their kids and questioning that they might lose contact with them some other reason might be that they I don\u2019t have any way to head incase tell husband cakes them out the maximum not unusual purpose is this year too much of what their dad and mom and their humans will reflect onconsideration on them.

"There are several proposed solutions to try and solve this crisis that is being experienced in the European Union. Each member of the European Union should actively involve themselves in solving the crisis by creating a new approach since the Dublin system seems to have failed. The union should make sure that each member state fulfills its first reception responsibilities thus preventing the refugees from moving to other states so as to live better. The EU can come up with an agreement that would define the sharing the reception of refugees in a manner that is just to both the refugee and the member states to ensure that the states commit to fully be responsible for hosting the refugees."
"Puerto Ricans would oftentimes have to be subordinate to women barking orders at them, and they would have to deal with ethnic stereotypes. Anytime they came into contact with mainstream society it would be a demeaning, humiliating, and negative experience. Thus, these types of experiences would future alienate them from mainstream society and drive them into the underground economy of crack, the only place where they can go to make money, and regain a certain sense of dignity and respect."
"Even after controlling income, youths in fatherless homes still had significantly higher odds of incarceration than those in mother father households. Youths who never had a father in the household experienced the highest odds. A 2002 Department of Justice survey of 7,000 inmates revealed that 39% of jail inmates lived in mother-only households. Approximately 46% percent of jail inmates in 2002 had a previously incarcerated family member."
"Watching \u2018A Class Divided\u2019 really brought along a lot of different feelings. First and foremost I learned from watching the kid\u2019s scene that you work better when you feel better and when you feel confident. Ms. Elliot\u2019s way of showing these kids about discrimination and racism was very effective and\u00a0taught the kids that no one person is different from the next, we all were created equal and it isn\u2019t right to judge. It is important for every child to learn in the early stages of life that everybody under the sun is created equally. We may not look the same, or dress the same, some of us may have a higher social status than others, but at the end of the day we still walk the same Earth, nobody is better than the next. The biggest impact from seeing the video is that it shows how easily discrimination can be taught to a young impressionable child. As Elliot explains that we adults train our children to think this way when we past judgment and then they see it and grow up to be familiar with it and think of it as ordinary."
"Harsh non-diegetic sound of locks opening and gates shutting emphasise the control the police have over their captives. The white teletex is accompanied by non-diegetic typewriter tapping which reports clinically and objectively the date Biko was given medical treatment. The camera pans from Biko\u2019s foot along his naked body lying on the floor of a cell before resting on a mid-shot of his face twisted to the side. Shadows of bars across him symbolise his captivity while the swollen and mangled flesh on his face indicates he has received massive head injuries from the police."
"But having these ideas and new things come our way might spark the future, which might make animals more like humans. They also breed these animals to produce offspring, they are looking for the traits that will be more immune to disease/disorder. By having these amazing way to test things we can test them on animals before they use on humans, to see if there working right."
"Social justice and equality can be factored into welfare designs and deliveries by assessing the needs of the target population. Since there has been tax cuts recently in the budget for social welfare projects, the government devised tools that would determine whether one is eligible for social welfare or not, such as income allowances and other monetary measures. What should we take into consideration in making and delivering social welfare services is not just the capacity of the individual to make money, but also the acceptance of society itself in that individual. Meaning, instead of looking at the individual\u2019s personal problems like he/she cannot find work or he/she cannot find a stable source of income, we should look at what kind of society that the individual revolve around. Is Canada\u2019s society discriminating against immigrants, Aboriginal peoples or women? Are there enough work for everybody? What state or working conditions in Canada? By doing these, we do not stereotype the individual and we do not label him/her, but we are actually looking at the holistic view of the current conditions. If Canada\u2019s working environment is not discriminating and on the other hand inviting to all citizens, then the target population of social welfare programs in terms of income supplement would be reduced."
"Libertarians seek a \u201cworld of liberty, a world in which all individuals are sovereign over their own lives\u201d. Contrasting to Chicago\u2019s strict gun laws prohibiting firearms, in a small town just outside Atlanta Georgia\u2019s city limits, a place named Kennesaw, mandated in 1982 that \u2018every head of household residing in the city limits is required to maintain a firearm.\u201d (Jimenez,2018,para.7) While this is in fact a law in this town, not all home owners do own a gun, and it is not enforced by the police. The law was enacted in 1982 to act as a crime deterrent, and with the violent crime rate below 2%, and a total of one murder in the last six years, id say the crime deterrent was a success. Criminals usually prey on the weak and venerable, but in a town where it is the law to possess a gun, statistics show that the possibility alone of a person with a gun steers criminal acts away. \u201cGovernment force must be limited to the rights of individuals to life, liberty and property.\u201d Libertarian stance on crime and justice, how would one defend these rights against wrong doers if they lost their inherent right to bare arms? They would be at the liberty of the non-law abiding citizen with the illegal gun, if there was success in repealing the 2nd amendment. Not to mention, it being our last line of defense if our government turns against its people with a well-armed militia of their own."
"My Mother, what can I say? But thank you! I am who I am today, because of her. She pushed me to do and be my best. I know at times I have disappointed her, but she stood by me. Pushing, nagging and loving me. I was the good kid, but I had a voice and boy did I use it! I do not know how she nor I survived my teenage years? I was amazed how much she learned between my ages of 14 and 22. She made life interesting, funny and scary. Not scary bad. I have to say she was not like the other Mothers, and I thank God for that. Some of my friends Mothers\u2019 were so strict and controlling. Yes, she set boundaries, but she allowed me to make mistakes and yes she made me take responsibility for those mistakes. She let me be me. Thank you Mom."
"Another factor that influenced the Congress of the United States was social and cultural control. Americans thought that their race was superior and better that the rest. They wanted a society where only Anglo-Saxons lived. Senator Ellison d. smith, from South Carolina said on April 9, 1924, \u201cI think we now have sufficient population in our country for us to shut the door and to breed up a pure, unadulterated American citizenship\u201d (Document I). This was another reason why they did not wanted to allow more aliens, that way they would not be able to get in the way of the perfect race."

On the day people involved are both family with their kotiri and tama for as a psychological support, security officer for maintaining peaceful environment, kaumatua is knowledgeable and having more experience for solving this kind of conflict, after listening both sided story the kaumatua make fair decision for them."
"When practicing in the early years environment children can be seen at there most potential when using their imagination. The most common area for this to take place is within the home corner, which is so called because it is designed to represent a house. Today\u2019s home corners will have a place for a tea and cutlery set, pots, pans, food, oven, sink, iron and ironing board, and clothes for dressing up."
"Rufus on the other hand is not Sheppard\u2019s son he was raised wrong. Shepard is trying to make an honorable young man. Sheppard is a widow his wife died a year before this story began. \u201cHe did not appear to notice his father\u201d this quote shows that Shepard is very concerned about Nortons well being."
"My family assessment was conducted on the 31st of October from 7-9 pm on a female client named Belle who is currently a petite 9 year and weighs 25.8kg and 130cm in height. She has been wearing spectacles due to her myopia and eczema since birth. She is presently Primary 3 and studying in Yishun Primary School."
"The story of Esther in the bible tells us of a young girl who was adopted as a baby. She grew up to become one of the greatest leaders of the Jewish people, and proves to all that just because someone is adopted, it doesn\u2019t mean that they cannot be a good person. One of the greatest people who is mentioned in the bible was adopted. This story can give hope to people who are adopted.. The Hierarchy of England and Wales said on 24 September 1968, \u201c\u2026it is against the plan of God to take positive steps to destroy the possibility of the transmission of human life\u201d."
"Love was very rare because of this. If a man were to marry a woman it would be as if she were a trophy and a symbol of his manlihood. From a woman\u2019s perspective, she would have no choice who she was to marry for it would be up to her parent\u2019s to decide. This decision would be based on the man\u2019s wealth and status in society."
"According to this view, , . In sum, then, the issue is whether the nation needs to strengthen their gun laws or we need to improve on our ways of gun training to make sure we get the proper information. My own view is that, .. Though I concede that many of our gun laws do need a big change, I still maintain that everyone should be informed with the proper gun training to help us prevent any atrocity from ever happening."
"In this poem, the mask grins and lies, which hides the true feeling or facial expression on the face of the person or group of people, such as African Americans, wearing the \u201cmask. \u201d In the line \u201cWith torn and bleeding hearts we smile,\u201d a hyperbole is used to exaggerate and place emphasis on the pain and psychological suffering that the African Americans were subject to at this time."
"Euler\u2019s formula: eix= cos( x)+ isin( x); x being any genuine number Wow\u2013 we\u2019re relating a fictional exponent to sine and cosine! What is much more intriguing is that the formula has a special case: when \u03c0 is alternatived to x in the above equation, the result is a fantastic identity called the Euler\u2019s identity: eix= cos( x)+ isin( x)."
"The table for two, set out neatly with two plates, two sets of cutlery and two wine glasses I think represents the opposite of the \u2018Scream\u2019 painting, the happy times in life; love and friendship. It could represent a marriage, or even just two close friends. The globes could show the journey through life, or the fact that all over the world everyone is living at the same time, everyone has a past, and a present. Everyone has their own problems in life and however big and important yours are, somewhere across the world someone has their own to deal with and your problems are of no significance to them."
"According to Paquet\u2019s definition, these civic integration programs may contradict multicultural models of immigration since they usually intend on influencing the beliefs and values of immigrants to fit with the pre-existing national identity. Civic integration programs commonly employ integration courses or introductory/orientation programmes, tests and contracts (Carrera et al, 2009: 3). Political philosopher Will Kymlicka defines multiculturalism as the legal and political accommodation of ethnic diversity (Kymlicka, 2012: 1). Modood offers a more detailed explanation, stating that multiculturalism is \u201cwhere processes of integration are seen both as two-way and as involving groups as well as individuals and working differently for different groups\u201d (Modood, 2011: 4)."
"It reached into the reader\u2019s mind to help them better understand the never-ending hardships African Americans had to endure on a daily basis.. He also includes metaphors such as when he says he sees \u201ctwenty million negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of proverty in the midst of an affluent society.\u201d (383) This metaphor creates a vivid picture of African Americans being seen only for enslavement. Since Dr. King uses this letter as an example of personal experience with enduring black peoples injustice. It allows the audience to view his argument and sympathize with his ultimate goal."
"Walker also presents in In Love and Trouble some black women\u2019s struggle with their own ethnicity and identity. After years of oppression and suppression, some black women become uncomfortable with their own ethnicity and have a growing desire to assimilate into the mainstream community. According to Washington, these women are \u201cvictims, not of physical violence, but of a kind of psychic violence that alienates them from their roots, cutting them off from real contact\u201d (95). She also considers education a factor of the struggles among those black women."
"Code of Practice on the Duty to Promote Race Equality 2002 \u2013 This is a statutory code which supports the public authorities to meet the duties set out in the Race Relations (amendment) Act 2000. All schools must produce a written race equality policy and include information on practical ways in which schools will work to promote racial equality. Schools need to create policies which show they are working towards the following outcomes:"
"However, it will be seen later on that Smiley will be one of those who will actively participate in the initiation of the riot, further implying that his adherence to the black cause is more than just skin deep. Smiley will be the one to set Sal\u2019s pizzeria on fire, which will signify victory for the Black race. The inclusion of these scenes in the movie once again indicate the standpoint from which the film\u2019s director comes from, making it apparent that Lee is trying to educate the viewer about these significant racial issues."
"As time went on laws and policies were put into place to stop this horrific time in American history by creating the Thirteenth Amendment which ultimately ended slavery. It did not make everything right over night and still as issues to this day. Over this period of time whites establish systems, practices, laws, and beliefs that classified African Americans inferior to the Caucasian race. The racism that was instilled in the privileges of whites were very persevering throughout the North and the South once slavery had in ended. This created the impression of black inferiority and white supremacy (The KKK) to a whole new level. It was not until 1868 the state changed the Fourteen Amendment to the Constitution to let citizenship and equal rights to the African American community. In 1870 the Fifteen Amendment was passed to allow black men to vote. By the 1890\u2019s Jim Crow laws discriminated against African Americans in public school but not for long with, in 1896 where the U.S Supreme Court Plessy vs. Ferguson and keyed the term \u201cseparate but equal\u201d for the treatment of African Americans. During modern civil rights movement starting in the 1940s that these discriminatory laws started to somewhat dissipate, but still white supremacy lingers on and remains a thriving ideology. For most people of color the hardships of justice, equality, and civility upheld into the twenty-first century."
"He stressed the effects of maternal deprivation were more likely to be due to the lack of something (privation) rather than any kind of loss (deprivation). Rutter M. believed that the crucial factor in determining the adverse effects of psychological development was what happened before and after the separation. His more plausible explanation attributed children\u2019s problems to family discord, loneliness, and changes in discipline and the changed circumstance of the residential parent e. g. the lower income or having to go out to work."
"A person\u2019s personality and attitude are dynamic and made up of various, complex set of factors. The question of nature versus nurture and its contribution to a person\u2019s personality has been debated for decades. Based on the interview that I conducted, I have come to a conclusion that one\u2019s environment plays a more crucial role in one\u2019s behavior. This is because one\u2019s upbringing and culture overrode any biological tendencies that a person may inherently and internally possess."
"The results of the studies reviewed all indicate that there is a need to highlight lack of education amongst nurses regarding restraint use. Because knowledge and sense of accountability play major roles in restraint application, keeping nurses updated with trends and new policies should be prioritised. Even with reports of decrease in restraint use, a number of incidents involving misuse of restraints are still rising. One in particular is the incident last September 2010 involving a known nursing care facility wherein it was proven that an 85-year old patient has been wrongly restrained on numerous occasions. The patient\u2019s wife has been repeatedly objecting restraint use but the hospital did not oblige. The staff reasoned that the patient had a high falls risk, and high levels of agitation, aggressiveness and restlessness."
"I know that I will gain more experience during the MBA studying and by going into private business. I will do my best in evaluating my strengths and weaknesses to be more circumspect. I am sure that by sticking to those mentioned previously shot and long term professional aims in this essay, I will achieve the desired goal."
"As a community, the residents of Franklinton need to be active participants in creating a space for their children; one that is safe and inviting where they can connect with each other and enjoy the local community. Seeing the town come together for the greater good of the children will surely give the residents, young and old, a sense of pride. As the children in Franklinton see the community build this space for them and future generations, it will provide an admirable example of what they themselves should aspire to do in their communities from here on."
"This is further proved after Sofia leaving Harpo when \u201cHarpo sit on the steps acting like he don\u2019t care\u201d. All of the words in this sentence are sharp and monosyllabic, showing that he is cut up and suppressing his true feelings. Later in the novel, as Harpo is making a net, we see a comparison to the previous sewing of the quilt between Celie and Sofia in which they were symbolically making a friendship, he is doing it because he wants to mend his errors and embrace the love again. It is also evident that Sofia still loves Harpo because of the difficulty she had when leaving, and the few significant items she took which I believe contained loving memories."
"To Woodward, the black community was a community that lacked active participation and unity to act as combined force in Southern politics, constantly being played by one white school of thought followed by the other. Whether this implies servility amongst the black vote to the white community is a debatable issue. However, one can argue that it was their educational backwardness and social upbringing as slaves which might have induced them to accept the white\u2019s point of view. However, one can argue without any doubt that the black community did stand up to fight for equal treatment and to finally put an end to racial separation, even though they might have been misled by some white forces."
"Porphyria is also portrayed as domineering, particularly in her relationship to the speaker, Porphyria was the powerful one in their relationship up until the point where the lover murders her, \u2018three times her little throat around, and strangled her\u2019 he is also under the impression that he is an omnipresent being worth of worship, \u2018Porphyria worshiped me\u2019. The lovers grasp on reality seems exceedingly senseless and the reader questions the lovers increasingly insane notions that makes up the lovers mind, having also described her to have \u2018glided in\u2019, like an Angel, a pure being that is the exact opposite of what Porphyria is- an adulterer, who is not afraid to exploit people of mental instability in order to satisfy her own sexual desires."
"Thus, summarizing the above stated information it becomes evident that immigration from Mexico is a complex and multifaceted process. The majority of illegal border crossings have a place due to the fact that people simply want to earn extra money, and many of them did not want to stay in the U.S. permanently. However, higher wages are a magnet, and there are also a lot of people who would like to make the United States the place of own permanent residence. An effort to develop the Mexican economy has been taken with an aim to stop illegal immigration (this effort is a very good idea if the government would be able to bring it up to the end. But it is extremely difficult to do, realistically, in the scale at which it needs to be done with an aim to substantially decrease illegal immigration level). It is impossible to think about the issue of illegal immigration from two prefabricated sides \u2013 to increase the possibility of legal entry into the United States, or to increase security at borders. It is so, because the problem is complex and serious and requires comprehensive approach to its solution."
"For the U.S economy to flourish to its full potential, outdated, immigration policy must be modernized. Not all immigrants are Hispanic! 30% of the immigration population come from Asia, as of right now more are coming from china than m\u00e9xico. A huge myth is that immigrants don\u2019t help the economy but immigrant owned businesses with employees have an average of 11 employees. 7.6% of immigrants were self-employed compared to the 5.6% of native born Americans and they founded more than 40% of fortune 500 companies."
"Everyday is a new and exciting day; it is a chance to meet nameless faces that can be made into friends and an opportunity to strengthen old friendships, thus each day should be faced with a bright smile and positive disposition. This is how my family and friends would primarily know me \u2013 an outgoing person, always ready to socialize with others. Because of this, I am able to maintain healthy relationships at home, in school, at work, and in the community. Moreover, I am organized, focused, and hard working. This is evident in my excellent mathematical and analytical skills showcased in school."
"Though there was no official proof that Japanese were involved in any such activities, they were nevertheless placed in such camps. WW I shaped a debate regarding the preferred racial composition in Canadian society. Canadians found the presence of enemy aliens distressing during the war. Germans, Austro-Hungarians and Ukrainian immigrants residing in Canada were forced into labour camps. Suspension from jobs was common and entry into many buildings for the so called aliens was denied. There were 500,000 German and Austro-Hungarian people living in Canada as well as over 125,000 Ukrainians."
"Despite the fact that the EU has a range of animal welfare laws the UK are predominantly improving their treatment towards animals which can be supported by World Animal Protection, an \u2018international non-profit animal welfare organization, shows that the UK has some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world.\u2019 New regulations are being implemented to strengthen animal welfare, primarily around puppy sales. This is known as \u2018the Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals) (England) Regulations 2018\u2019. Furthermore, making CCTV cameras mandatory in all slaughterhouses and planning a rise in prison sentences for offenders who do not abide by the new regulations that were introduced."
"He writes about itinerant workers travelling together to work on lonely ranches during the great depression. They, the characters in the story, have to regularly find temporary employment, working heavily on ranches for small pay, \u201cTo-morra we\u2019re gonna go to work. I seen thrashin\u2019 machines on the way down. That means we\u2019ll be bucking grain bags, bustin\u2019 a gut. \u201d These workers have next to nothing to look forward to after they retire, as a character named Candy demonstrates, \u201cI planted crops for damn near ever\u2019body in this state, but they wasn\u2019t my crops, and when I harvested \u2019em they none of my harvest."
"One of the few case studies of undocumented immigrants available, this perceptive anthropological study improves a group of people too often abridged to statistics and typecast. The suffering of Hispanic relocation is expressed in the immigrants\u2019 own accent while the author\u2019s voice elevates questions about authority, typecast, settlement, and assimilation into American society."
"Travellers children face segregation in schools with one school going as far as to paint a white line throw the middle of the playground which the traveller children were not allowed to cross. An Irish independent journalist described them as being \u201cbeasts with no human qualities\u201d! Accommodation is another issues faced by the travelling community with an insufficient amount Group Housing Permanent halting sites and council housing. The government has failed to reach its target but yet has criminalised trespassing on private property. As a result criminalising their nomadic culture which is a basic attack on there civil and human rights."
"I feel like I\u2019m at the stage in my life where I\u2019m just figuring out relationships in every sense of the word. As I grow older, I learn more about the people around me and it influences the way I see them, which in turn influences how I think about and act towards them. When I was younger I used to think of my parents as gods that would always be there for me and could do no wrong. Now as I get older, I realize that that\u2019s not true. This doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not good parents, I just realized that they\u2019re human, they make mistakes too and sometimes they can be wrong too. I also realized that people grow apart. Some of the people I used to be friends with in middle school are no longer my friends and that\u2019s okay. As for romantic relationships, that\u2019s a can of worms I\u2019d rather not think about."
"Smoking was lowering his hormone level and continuing to smoke would cause him to get sick more often. To help him quit I mentioned that he should exercise to get his mind off smoking, eat healthier and try to keep busy around the office, since there is no smoking in government buildings anymore."
"Scientist have predicted that about a sixth of the country will be under water after global warming has taken full effect. The Maldive Islands are a nation of 1190 islands that are home to over 200,000 people. These islands are only 1. 5 meters above sea level and if global warming occurs then all of those people will have to be relocated. There are many things that we as human beings can do to help prevent global warming from happening. We can start to take advantage of all the different types of renewable energy instead of burning fossil fuels that pollute the atmosphere in multiple ways."
"The Las Vegas shooting, as the deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual in the United States, drew people\u2019s attention to gun control and sparked debate over gun control one again. Dianne Feinstein introduced a gun control bill to ban bump stocks to the Senate. (ABC news)11 states banned bump stocks and several other states were considering banning it. (History) Students are also exposed to shootings in the United States. According to research conducted by EveryTown, there were about 89 incidents of gunfire in schools in 2018. More than 2,700 children and teenagers were shot and killed and more than 14,500 are shot and injured every year and about 3 million children are exposed to gun shootings. (EveryTown Research) The Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting is one of the most famous school shootings, in which 20-year-old Adam Lanza killed 20 children and six adults before he finally shot himself in the head."
"In the school, in a new city for the first time in his experience, Laye encounters difficult language barriers and a hot, humid climate more taxing and oppressive than that in his Koroussa home. He also seeks changes during the day where people at their work are dressed in a Western style, but in boubou\u2019s when they come home from work. Laye lives the life of a typical college school student, studying at the school\u2019s campus and returning home to Koroussa during the holidays. When he returns, he sees the transformation within his family and friends."
"On November 9, 2014, a Black person was shot and killed by the police within minutes of receiving a 911 call about a domestic violence disturbance. The victim was armed with a knife, apparently putting two trained police officers\u2019 life in imminent danger, according to the local police department. On January 31, local prosecutor Brian Mackie determined that David Ried, the white police officer responsible, acted in \u201clawful self-defense\u201d and that no charges would be pursued. The shooting occurred in Ann Arbor, Michigan, a college town home to the University of Michigan, a bastion of radical activism since the 1960s, and considered to be a progressive-minded city likened to Berkeley, California."
"In the last five years alone China has executed over 5,000 people. It\u2019s not too late to change humanity and put a stop to this sadistic defiance against nature. The death penalty should be outlawed, because it is pure cruelty, the expense of it is massive, and certainly death is the easy way out for these wicked beings. Claim #1:"
"Approximately 1.3 million women are physically assaulted by an intimate partner annually in the United States. In a 1995\u20131996 study conducted through the fifty states including the District of Columbia, it was found that nearly 25% of women were raped and/or physically assaulted by a current or former spouse, cohabiting partner, or dating/acquaintance at some time in their lifetime (American Bar Association, 2010). According to the U.S. Department of Justice, between 1998 and 2002, of the almost 3.5 million crimes committed against family members, almost half of these were crimes against spouses. Eighty-four of those spouse abuse victims were females. In 2001, intimate partner violence made up 20% of all nonfatal violent crime experience by women. In 2000, 1,247 women were killed by their intimate partner (American Bar Association, 2010)."
"It is actually stress-free and can help us to have time to more valuable parts of our life, like having more time to spend with our family and friends. Finally, as a student that works and studies at the same time, I have to be a smart consumer. I ask myself what I need and what I really don\u2019t. Why do I need a car? Is it necessary to have a laptop when we have a library full of computers? We all need to learn that how to spend our money in a better way, and know that we do not need to have the newest and coolest things that the market offer us to be happy."
"To choice to follow a religion or certain religions can adversely affect the birth rate, with regards to particular religious rules and restrictions. For example an orthodox Roman Catholic would not allow himself to use contraception. Also how a religion views a women\u2019s role in society is important, because that can affect the opportunities she is offered. Other example of religion adversely affecting birth rate is the rule in Islam, that men can have up to four wives and also the early marriages."
"People have been talking racism for centuries. People continue to be racists. How do we solve this problem. Everybody has dealt with it, politicians, spiritual leaders, community activities, and the problems of racism continue. First, we have to admit that racism is a problem and that it\u2019s a psycho-social problem. But racists are like alcoholics. In Alcoholics Anonymous and Gamblers Anonymous, first the people have to admit they have a problem. Admit they are out of control alcoholics, admit they are out of control gamblers before they can solve the problem. The problem with racism and racialism is that everybody denies it. Everybody is in denial. There are many ways to solve the racism:"
"Obviously, due to the increased flow of immigrants into the country the anti-immigrant sentiment increased. The press began to arise debate about whether immigrants are necessary for modern America or not. As Blondell (2008) demonstrated, polls show that nearly two-thirds of the population of the United States was against the liberalization of immigration laws. But at the same time, it is obvious that without immigrants the United States can experience some difficulties in economic development. But on the other hand, the U.S. have tightened penalties for illegal immigrants, because they contribute to a decline in prices for labor and cause great resentment among American workers."
"Don\u2019t let him do it\u201d. John Steinbeck uses words like \u2018slashed, smashed and slugging\u2019 to describe the fight which makes the fight sound dramatic, the other reason why the fight is very dramatic is that this is the first mention in the book of physical violence and it shows the reader the brute strength of Lennie, and so this is what makes the story even more dramatic. The fist time Crooks comes into the scene he is involved in anger and violence. When Lennie goes into Crooks\u2019 chamber he speaks sourly with Lennie, \u201cYou got no right to come in my room. This here\u2019s my room. Nobody got any right in here but me."
"By the first decade of the twentieth century immigrants constituted almost sixty-six percent of the total inflow of people into urban America, and America had officially made its reputation as the melting pot of the world. Consequently this rise in immigration resulted in a rise of American nativism. American values, the lack of jobs, World War I, and II are just a fraction of the things that enhanced nativism in America between 1900 and 1930."
"America now 200 years past that period, still holds its core value of hard work. Our ancestors worked hard for their families themselves and their future. The method of becoming an American citizen has expanded into a process that takes time, hard work, and sacrifices all of which our ancestors that came to America encountered. Freedom is a right and a privilege that takes time and effort to obtain."
"\u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d by John Steinbeck is about two ranch workers aiming to fulfill their dream of having their own farm. The story occurs in the 1930s, which is the time of the Great Depression in America. A main theme in \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d is loneliness, and characterization highlights this theme. The novel incorporates different characters who all faced loneliness and isolation due to multiple reasons. Crooks is for his race, Candy is for his age, Curley\u2019s wife is for her gender and George is for his obligation to Lennie."
"The institution of family is a basic unit in the society, and the multi functions performed by it make it a much-needed institution in a society. Some of the important functions performed by the family include reproduction of new members and socializing them, and provision of emotional and physical care for older persons and young. Family in fact, is an institution which resolves or eases a large number of social problems."
"Only Slim knew what I was doing though. He knew me well enough. I sent Curley in the other direction from where I knew Lennie was. He would go to the brush like I told him to. He always tried to do what I told him. I ran off and found him straight away. Lennie hid in the brush by the pool. He was sitting there by the river and he was talking to himself. He kept saying sorry: he knew that I would look after him. He made me tell him about our farm house for what was to be the last time. I mentioned it, and, he heard it. I told him not to look at me. I was trying to be a man but I couldn\u2019t control my eyes and hands. I was shaking too. I talked quietly to him about the little place we would have together, then I shot him with Carlson\u2019s gun. When the other men found me near by Lennie, they all assumed I shot Lennie in self-defence. Only Slim understands what I did and why"
"The play starts with Christine singing and her old childhood friend hears her melodious voice and recalls his love for the girl. The play starting with the girl singing and Raoul rekindling their love shows a very good starting of a play. The viewer knows for sure that Christine and Raoul had a thing going on before the occurrence of events (Francis & Leroux, 2007)."
"Ms. Paley grown up in Chicago, but her first teaching was in the south. She lives there many years and teach only white student. She believes in the integration of classes. When she was forced to teach only white children she insisted for the reason the she\u2019s always dream of visiting black children in their own home. One of her student is a black child namely Alma Franklin. She was five years old, very shy and tame child."
"In my opinion, the law is an overwhelming failure, mostly because it\u2019s pointless, at best, and dangerous, at worst. Universities have police forces for a reason. It\u2019s likely that, should an issue arise, more students and professors with guns will just cause difficulties for, already on-edge, police officers. This, on top of the previously mentioned issues, shows the risks outweigh the benefits, and because those benefits likely don\u2019t exist, this policy is the antithesis of good policy. The policy must reflect research if we want it to work. \u201cGut-feelings\u201d or Hollywood fantasy have no place in governing the lives of millions."
"As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth. His disciples asked him, \u201cMaster, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind? Neither this man nor his parents sinned,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cbut this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him (John 9:1-3)."
"By studying these factors, this paper will determine the viability of third-party intervention under the PMESII-PT framework utilized by the Department of Defense. Critical areas of analysis under this framework include political, military, economic, social, information, infrastructure, physical environment, and time. Through the PMESII-PT framework, it will be shown that Yemen is a country largely controlled by conflict within its own borders, and without increased humanitarian assistance and shuttle diplomacy efforts from third-party nations, Yemen will remain a country in economic, military, political, cultural, and social turmoil, subjecting it to be a war-torn country for years to come and creating an ongoing humanitarian crisis."
"Ever since George and Lennie began working together they had a plan. They were going to save up their money, buy a farm, and \u201clive of the fatta the land\u201d. After a few weeks, they were so close to achieving their goal when Lennie accidentally kills Curley\u2019s wife. At this point, George realizes that their dream would never really become a reality and he openly admits so: \u201cI think I knowed we\u2019d never do her."
"As far as Hellenistic society was concerned, the roles of women were limited to being wives who provide services to men, home manager, and the weak gender. The perspectives of Hellenism considered females as subordinates to men, which somehow raised men\u2019s role in the society in the pedestal considering that females were deprived with the opportunity to learn and to gain knowledge from subjects like science and philosophy. However, this societal stereotype was thwarted by Hypatia (370 \u2013 415 C."
"The issue is the people being killed are being killed for no reason, Majority of them are innocent and more importantly unarmed; leaving the officers with no good motive for their actions. The biggest upset with this protest is people are saying that all lives should matter not just black lives. Though the whole point of the movement isn\u2019t to say that all lives don\u2019t matter, rather instead itjust focuses on the group specifically facing cruelty, School education plays a big role in inequality of many races as well. Students are expected to engage in courses that don\u2019t depict the reality of their life Majority of schools aren\u2018t covering the contribution of black political leaders as much as they cover white historical figuresl There are also issues with schools failing to reveal historical information of racial groups in an accurate way In a McGraw\u00bbHill calling the slaves \u2018workers\u2018 who \u2018emigrated\u2019 to the States downplayed history textbook the true portrayal of slavery."
"Physical health would always be followed by psychological health. It is important to know that child marriage does not only affect physically but it also affects mentally. According to Nour (2006), during childbirth, there is a possibility of young mothers to face fistulas. Fistulas happened due to the force from the fetus\u2019s head on the vagina wall that causes tissue necrosis. This is because their bones are not fully ready for pregnancy and delivery. Fistulas will cause fecal or urinary incontinence and peroneal nerve palsy that lead to embarrassment and resulting depression. Other than that, \u201cbride abduction\u201d is a practice of marrying female adolescents without their approval in Kyrgyzstan. Some brides that were abducted are as young as 12 years old. In some cases, the bride will be brought to the abductor\u2019s house and raped. The purpose of doing so was to make the girl feel humiliated of herself and unable to return to her parents\u2019 house (Miller, 2015). According to Alanen (2016), some victims feeling extremely isolated and depressed that they decided to commit suicide at the end as an escape from the miserable life."
"Most notably, the family system has a hierarchy denoting the power relations among members and boundaries that demarcate and define the rules for interactions between subsystems. Finally, families are open systems that are influenced by events occurring in their environment. Families consistently and progressively change as they adapt to these outside forces, as well as to internal forces such as the development of their individual members. However, in the case of single parenting, the primary directing unit is impaired (Bornstein, 2002 p.109)."
"Ultimately the woman\u2019s opinion must take priority over the man\u2019s\u2014because she has to carry the foetus, but, once a foetus is formed, one can have a degree of sympathy for the man\u2019s situation. If copulation had taken place for the purpose of impregnation, then why should the man suffer a feeling of loss just because his partner changes her mind? Where contraception is used, his argument may be weakened\u2014they did not intend parenthood. But if both were planning for a baby, is it fare that once that child exists, the mother can take it away from its father, even though he has done no wrong?"
"S. legally (2). Upon purchasing a gun you have to take a class on gun safety and use and are required to have a full criminal background check and to give your full set of fingerprints. I do not think that this is being enforced enough and shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly. If we can keep the guns out of the wrong hands, we can eliminate most of the crimes caused by them. \u201cBy definition, a criminal is someone who breaks the law. Criminals have many ways to obtain weapons without going through the process mandated by the Brady Bill. Two obvious examples are theft and black market purchases."
"A guy needs somebody \u2014 to be nearhim (72). Crooks\u2019 room is said to have many personal belongings lying around unorganized.By creating such a messy image of Crooks\u2019 room, Steinbeck demonstrates that being alone,Crooks could leave his things about (66). Crooks\u2019 isolation is aggravated by him beingAfrican-American. Crooks, a lonely character, is used as a counterexample of the relationshipbetween George and Lennie. For the reader to fully understand their happiness, he or she must first be introduced to a melancholy character."
"Rizal\u2019s works, his experience, his attitude. His love for the country can make all Filipino citizens idolize him and become inspiration of us. Our freedom from the Spanish colonials, our fighting spirit of becoming free from the conquerors is because Rizal opens the eyes of every Filipino. He died because he loves Filipino people and Philippines. Filipinos was determined because Rizal waken up every Filipino so there is no doubt why we study his life, it is beginning of our freedom, why we live like this today, free from foreigner\u2019s cruelty, but it is sad to think about that many of Filipinos forgot about how Rizal save our country from conquerors which is the Spaniards."
"This phenomenon is purely psychological. Padmini is legally wedded to Devadutta out of her desire for fair looks and intellect; and attracted to Kapila for his physical elegance and manual efficiency. P. Dhanavel claims that the flourishing friendship between Kapila and Padmini leads to the acute crisis of identity in Padmini herself affirms that the song: \u2018Is this one that / Or that one this?\u2019 points to her autobiography. When Padmini visualizes Kapila arriving during their trip to forest she loses her sense of propriety and herself divides. The Bhagavata simultaneously chants: \u2018And the head is bidding good-bye to the heart.\u2019(95) She relegates Devadutta to the background and gets preoccupied with Kapila: \u2018And what an ethereal shape.\u2019"
"Conrad might be saying that although we live in a civil age we are no different to the Roman conquerors. I believe this shows that Conrad is not racist as he is saying that \u2018taking away\u2019 the earth \u2018from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves\u2019 is wrong."
"In an address to doctors visiting Rome for Holy Year celebrations, the Pope told them they had an unshakable mission to defend life from its natural start to its natural end. The Roman Catholic Church teaches that life begins at the moment of conception and ends at the moment of natural death. The Church defends the rights of Roman Catholic doctors, even those working in public institutions, to claim conscientious objection to abortion or euthanasia and not be party to them."
"Another dilemma that surrounds this phenomenon when the fetus will live with problems and also it will continue causing problems in the family in its lifetime. On this, the decision of the mother or the patient takes center stage (Warren, 1984). One, no one is very sure of the future, but we can probably predict what will happen. Medical practitioners may advise the patient with a different perspective that will not be pleasing to the patients. The patients may also opt to take their doctors advice or not. The question of moral and ethical adherence in such a situation is at stake. This leaves the patient at the liberty to make a decision. With the existing ethical codes, there lacks a clear directive with a concrete constitute on how to deal with the situation perfectly."
"Whithin the group there are often one or more younger black back males, a few females , and a number of youngsters and infants. A mature silverback at least twelve years old is their leader. This enormous gorilla decides when and where the group travels , feeds , rests and sleeps. The leader is the chief protector of the group."
"Victim\u2019s rights advocates protested a further narrowing of the number of individuals who were eligible for the death penalty. It\u2019s been argued that the Courts should not group juveniles together as a class of defendants, but instead \u201cacknowledge that they are all different with respect to their experience, maturity, intelligence and moral culpability (Cameron; Blog)."
"Ko Byung-Soo was my mentor and my best friend. The first place I met him was the Korean Army. He taught me many things and helped me in many ways when I couldn\u2019t adapt to a new place. He was one of the squad members I belonged to. When I first saw him, he looked kind. He was about 5.5 feet tall and chubby, and his face was oval, and his eyes were big and round. However, he was tough and hot-tempered, unlike the way he looked."
"As being a true friend he or she can be around my husband and never have to worry about them flirting or making a move towards him , or backstabbing. Someone who , when I ask a question, I need information about something, he or she gives me the real deal."
"The tournament hall was filled with silence and I couldn\u2019t even hear my opponent\u2019s breath. I sat down in the soft cushioned chair, shook my hands with the opponent, cleared all the thoughts going on in my mind, and focused on the board. I was able to feel my heartbeat. I looked at my mom before starting the game. She didn\u2019t move a muscle. I closed my eyes to take a deep breath and calm myself down. When I opened my eyes, every cell in the body worked furiously and they were attentive. A foot step came near and I heard \u201c the game begins now\u201d. The timer started and since I was playing for the white side, I made the first move. I don\u2019t remember any moves I made. The only thing I remember was the last move I made. The checkMate. At last I won the game. That\u2019s when I saw the tears coming out of my mom\u2019s eyes for the third time and this time it\u2019s out of happiness."
"The primary method of recruiting soldiers for any war is to hang recruitment posters to entice healthy and patriotic men to enlist in the Army. Many recruitment posters were filled with pictures and slogans of patriotism. One such Union poster had the phrases \u201cRally \u2018round the Flag, Boys!\u201d, \u201dCome one! Come all!\u201d and \u201cUnited we stand! Divided we fall!\u201d(Resnick). This recruitment poster also consists of a wide array of American symbols, such as the American flag, the bald eagle, and olive branches. A few years into the Civil War, the Union was in need of more soldiers. After President Abraham Lincoln passed the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared that \u201call persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free\u201d(Lincoln), black men were allowed to enlist in the military. With 3.5 million freed slaves in varying states, the Union decided to enlist colored men to join the army. A recruitment poster, provided by Omeka RSS, shows this with the phrase \u201cCOLOR\u2019D MEN WANTED\u201d at the top."
"Person centred \u2013 views the person as individual and unique and places the person at the centre of there care whether this be physical, psychological, social, spiritual.

"I include lots of sensory exploration, by using different types of materials, calm music, I put scent in the water or play dough, I encourage children to be independent by letting them try to put their own shoes and cloths, washing hands and help serving the tables and tidy up after. I use lots of toys, which I made myself, like empty boxes which I cut, paint, stick coloured paper and encourage children to either sort colours, fit other objects, observe how the bowl is moving, etc."
"honesty \u2013 Friends have to be honest with each other, tell the truth he might get angry with you, it might hurt him, but the truth still matters, without honesty in a true friendship it is bound to fail and let him know how you are feeling a true friend knows you best. So tell him everything are u hurt, sad ,lonely, happy or miserable he is someone with whom you are not scared to let your guards down around. A true friend will not take advantage of these, instead will help to feel better and respect you as well as your vulnerability. After i told seye what happened with my fake friends he didnt laugh at me, he told me he knew because he has also heard it before but he couldn\u2019t tell me, because i blindly trusted them and was sincere with them. He said he was sorry because if he had told me i would have avoided thisH. He called his other friends who made me feel welcomed and loved and also made me laugh."
"It is understandable that there is reluctance to consider them as refugees since such a status, under the international charters, makes them eligible not only for residence in the United States but also makes them eligible for social assistance and placement. In contrast, immigrants are managed by the conditions of their migration or residence programs and there is greater leeway for their ejection when they are proven to be unproductive or detrimental to society. Thus, Rosa and Enrique can only turn to illegal means of entering the country as illustrated by their association with a \u201ccoyote\u201d who smuggles them into the country."
"He did this because it \u201cMade me seem so god damn smart alongside of him\u201dP41. So George definitely is no angel and can be petty and nasty as much as the next person, but he genuinely cares for Lennie. George\u2019s first words, a stern warning to Lennie not to drink so much lest he get sick on page 5, set the tone of their relationship. George may be snappy and impatient at times, but he never strays from protecting Lennie."

"Steinbeck has a good perspective on showing different outcomes that are caused by discrimination. One of the outcomes in Of Mice and Men is when Crooks shows how lonely he is being the only black man, and having everyone hate him, and not wanting to be around him because they think he is beneath them. Steinbeck uses Curley\u2019s wife to show the reader that Crooks has lost hope in fighting for his rights when Curley\u2019s wife says, \u201c Listen, nigger."
"People around the world have a universal scare for airplanes. There are many negatives to flying, but it\u2019s the only way to get to one country to another. In my mind, planes need some work. There are many things I would like to change when it comes to the normal commercial jet, and I believe that these things would create a more comfortable and relaxing environment for all passengers when flying. The first thing I would like to change about planes is the space they provide for you. On a normal commercial jet they have 100-150 seats, I want to change the number of seats to 50-100."
"NHS staff, knowingly or unknowingly, treat UASC differently to others. This can be seen as a reflection of the structural and cultural discrimination discussed above. Williams (2004) also argues that the law introduced to stop failed asylum seekers from accessing some secondary healthcare will confuse practitioners about the level of healthcare they can offer to those waiting for a decision on their asylum claim. This is oppression on the structural level. The legislation constructs a discourse about failed asylum seekers that society misinterprets to include all asylum seekers."
"There will be a difference in what is discussed and you need to always be mindful or your position within your school and the relationship you have with these individuals. Should you be discussing work issues these may be confidential so you would need to follow these guidelines. However well you get on with anyone you work with or support as Teaching Assistant you will always need to remain professional."
"As of late the divorce rate has been dropping and that is not exactly good news. The reason for the drop in this divorce rate is the new way of living. Couples now have decided that before they get married that they need to live together in order to see how marriage should work. Most of these couples never get married and still live together."
"You know, it\u2019s actually kind of Lraumatizing to watch someone you love die right in front of you. I would visit her every day when I got out of school, I would make my brother drive me there, With each visit her health would get worse and worse. Every Sunday we would go to church my dad would sadly tell me \u201cYour Maw-Maw probably will not be with us much longer\u201d. I tried so hard not to believe that, I kept telling my dad \u201cShe\u2018ll get better, don\u2019t say that. It just takes time\u201d. An old family friend of mine, someone who was like a cousin to me came over to visit her one day. She practically raised him. Here it was, an 18\u2014year-old boy, sat down next to her bed and started bawling. That\u2019s when I knew this wasn\u2018t going to end well. The last time I saw my Maw-Maw before she died was at nighttime, I told her I loved her, gave her a kiss on the forehead and she looked up and she said \u201cOh, an angel\u201d."
"The two works both include relationships between humans and animals. In To a Mouse, a field worker upsets a mouse\u2019s nest and then reflects on it. This is similar to Steinbeck\u2019s novel, in which Lennie unintentionally destroys the lives of small, furry animals, one of them actually being a mouse. The most important similarity between the two works though, actually lies in the quote \u201cThe best laid schemes o\u2019 Mice an\u2019 Men, (often go awry)\u201d."
"Opponents of this stance cite the second amendment of the US constitution, which recognizes the need for a well-regulated militia in any free state and protects against infringement of the right to keeping and bearing arms. Lose interpretations of the constitutional amendment have led to the conclusion that gun control is not unconstitutional. In contrast, strict interpretations hold that gun control prohibits the exercise of the second amendment right of bearing and keeping arms (Wagner and Machnowski 1)."
"Of Mice and Men is a novella centred on the disincentives of America during the depression in the 1930\u2019s. The country known as \u2018the land of opportunity,\u2019 is dismissed as it became deprived and inept. Many men were itinerant workers that travelled from ranch to ranch looking for wages that would be sufficient till they moved on. These types of men were the loneliest, with no companionship. It is this transient migrant lifestyle which highlights the importance of the relationship between Lennie and George, a rarity among the other characters to be exact."
"Now a days children are listened to by their parents more, children didn\u2019t use to have a say in what they wanted to do, boys were sent to school to get a good career and girls were kept at home to learn house skills. These days both genders can get an education and its quite normal for children to go to cri??che as young as 1 year old, this helps them to interact and to learn social skills So the decline of the Nuclear family and male dominance could be attributed to the opportunities facing women today that were not available in the 1950\u2019s when the \u2018 golden age\u2019 of families was being promoted."
"I believe that many of the reasons for having abortions are totally unacceptable. For example, there have been reports that some pregnancies were terminated because parents decided that their child was the \u2018wrong\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd sex. I think that too many women do not look hard enough to find the possible solutions of the problems that arise with pregnancies. Parents must take more responsibility as the situation has only arisen because of the parents\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd negligence whilst having sex. In my opinion, if a woman does not feel she is ready to bring up a child, the best option is to put the child up for adoption, as there are thousands of people who are desperate to foster or adopt children. I also believe that it is right to terminate the life of one or more foetuses involved in a multiple pregnancy to preserve the life of other foetuses. Finally, I think that although doctors should consult other doctors, they should not be prosecuted for carrying out an abortion in extreme circumstances. For example, in 1938, Dr Alexander Bourne performed an abortion on a 14-year-old girl after a gang of soldiers raped her. Dr Bourne informed the police and was prosecuted."

"(TheTrace) We can draw a conclusion that two thirds of people use guns to end their life and the majority of people give up committing suicide if they do not succeed in killing themselves at one time. However, guns are extremely fatal. There is a chance for people who want to kill themselves not using a gun to survive, which may change their whole life because of that survival, such as going on to live optimistically. For people who choose to use a gun to die, they may have no chance to survive at all because almost 90% percent of them will die. No other ways of committing suicide are as lethal as using a gun."
"Choices are easy to be made and regrets are haunting like nightmares. A decision to terminate a fetus in the womb of the mother is painful to both physical and mental health. Abortion has always remained as a controversial dispute in the United States. The actual value of human life begins with the birth from a mother\u2019s womb. Although it is a heartbreaking decision for every single mother to kill her own child, some decisions are made due to different circumstances, such as medical conditions, rape, or teenage pregnancies."
"If drugs are truly unjust then America has over four hundred and fifty thousand people in jail unjustly. They are not just being punished for no reason they are being punished for exercising their right as a human, making their own choices. Everyone has the right to choose to do drugs or not to do them. If there was a drug that took away the users freedom to make choices or to attack and hurt other people then the government could step in and help, however no drug exists that have that effects on people. The belief supporting that it is a human right to choose to do drugs comes from the idea that everyone owns their own body. So a person can make any choice as what they can do to their body, harmful or not. An example of this can be seen in the woman\u2019s right to have or not have an abortion."
"This is the exact text of the article, as congress approved it and the uniformed code of military justice, ucmj. The second part of six of the manual for court martial, mcm, is the elements; these are the specifics of the offense. The third is next but, first back to the elements\u2026 In order to support a finding of guilty, the government must prove each and every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The third of six of the manual for court martial, mcm, is the explanation. The explanation defines terms, and clarifies the elements, based on previous decisions. The fourth of the sixth of the manual for court martial, mcm, is the lesser included offense."
"Starting school or nursery could be the first major life event that a person goes through and lots of people can remember their first day at school. Those who start school are normally nervous yet excited, this is because they are looking forward to being in a new place, yet scared because they don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to be like. Children may end up crying for their mother or father or carer because it could be their first day without them and this could make them miss their loved ones."
"Historically the philosophical concept of identity began from the Latin term idem which means sameness or congruence. The term originated in relation with mathematics from a numerically complete form or a quantitatively rigorous data point that is used in the process of classification. The first definition of identity is rooted in the ideas of Parmenides he suggested a logical operationalization of identity in relation with cognition. Language is identical with thought and thought tio cognition and the object to itself, which is a main feature of identity."
"As a Command Senior Enlisted Advisor, it is my daunting responsibility to correlate, edit, and assemble large volumes of paperwork submitted by the enlisted staff and medical professionals. l have to interpret documents Written in \u201cphysician\u2019s chickenrscratch\u201c from my doctors to nurses using What I call their \u201cLino\ufb02icial allrtheirrown language\u201d that is private and often encrypted, With Words even I have trouble pronouncing. Obtaining a degree will allow me to better understand the intent of what the medical professionals are saying and therefore allow me to pass on information in simpler terms to the staff. 0n the other hand, it Will allow me to take what the staff are saying and pass it on to the phy5icians and nurses. As a Leading Chief Petty Officer. it is my responsibility to recognize the outstanding efforts and/or achievements of my enlisted staff. Whether composing Commanding General\u2019s Certificates of Commendation or submitting nominations for impact awards, such as the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, proper preparation and a strong grasp of the English language are required to properly convey in Writing a sailor\u2019s performance. Taking care of my sailors in order to ensure they get the recognition they deserve is one of the most important jobs that I can do as a Chief Petty Officer. It is therefore extremely important that l master this course and further my education. My children are another factor pushing me to obtain an associate of art\u2019s degree. My daughter is a freshman in high school and my son is in Junior high. Obtaining my degree Will enable me to better understand and help them With their homework."
"More precisely, it is at the first level of discrimination which is antilocution. In this stage, it is talked about white people in unflattering terms, and Eva freely discusses her negative feelings towards a certain group of people, which are white people. A second important example of stereotype in this movie is when a very immature boy draws a drawing of a black student with enlarged features, which resulted to be oversized lips. He made a huge mistake by drawing that and sending it around the classroom so people would laugh at it. This is when the teacher realized there was a common ground between the students in room 203, and the Jews during the Holocaust. She immediately made the connection when she saw the inappropriate drawing of the black man. She remembered and told her class how Jewish people were drawn with having oversized noses. These were put in the newspaper by the Nazi, along with other \u201cscientific\u201d evidence that Jewish people were inferior to the rest, and it did not matter whether they lived or died. This is how the extermination of the Jewish people occurred during the World War 2."
"To all those teenagers with problems regarding vanity and insecurity, you should be able to face your own fear of rejection so that you wouldn\u2019t be living in a superficial world. Be brave enough to bring out your true identity because you should always give yourself a chance to prove that you are indeed \u201cworth it.\u201d They say that it is not because things are difficult that we do not dare, it is because we do not dare that they are difficult. So dare to face your fears and dare to be true to yourself for it is only then that you would find inner peace and self-confidence."
"However, Alberta dies during childbirth and Rose accepts to adopt her daughter Raynell whose father Troy dies when she is seven years old. Being an African-American, the act of having more than one wife is not out of the norms owing to African culture with him. However, finding himself in a society where polygamy is viewed as a thing past by time, Troy could not marry Rose while still having the first wife and he could not bring Alberta as another wife thus he ended up having an affair with her other than coming to the light (Sofola).."
"The Fourth Amendment states that people have a right to be secured against unreasonable searches and seizure without probable cause. \u201cLatinos pose a danger not because their conduct is illegal, but because of their purported status- they are illegal. Therefore, they are more in danger to being searched\u201d (Carbado and Harris, 2011). This statement reflects that race can always be a probable factor when it comes to immigration laws which breaks the Fourth Amendment, though some may argue that is not the case."
"Greg Holland (2006), director at the National Center for Atmospheric Research disagrees with what the IPPC have found, \u201cThe hurricanes we are seeing are indeed a direct result of climate change. The wind and warmer water conditions that fuel storms in the Caribbean are, increasingly due to greenhouse gases. There seems to be no other conclusion you can logically draw. The large bulk of the scientific community say what we are seeing now is linked directly to greenhouse gases.\u201d"
"Many surveys suggest criminals obtain their weapons through this illegal firearms market. One study indicated that in 37 percent of their arrests the criminal said they could obtain a gun in less than a week, while another 20 percent said they could get a firearm in a day or less. (O\u2019Niell 1). You everyday criminals don\u2019t just walk to the gun store and buy a gun; they get it from the black-market. These guns are usually stolen guns and unregistered. Taking away our right to legally have and buy guns is only going to lead to guns being in the wrong hands and ordinary citizens will be defenseless."
"One area where the perspectives were very similar throughout both articles was the focus on how this experience affected her entire family. Both articles talk about the hard times Ruby Bridges family had to go through. Ruby also says in the NPR article \u201d my mother and father had gone through such a hard time that by the time I graduated from sixth grade, they were separated.\u201d I would imagine this was really hard for Ruby to endure especially after all she had already experienced. The Social Studies for Kids article gave a little bit more details with what happened to Ruby\u2019s family in hard times. It says \u201cHer father lost his job but was eventually offered another one at another business. Her grandparents were forced to leave the land where they had been sharecroppers for 25 years.\u201d Having bad things happen to your family shared in both perspectives was an unfortunate part of RubyBridges journey. It appears that both authors may have backgrounds where the family is valued because they both felt the need to be descriptive when discussing the struggles Ruby Bridges family experienced. It highlights another sacrifice that was a result of their determination to achieve equality."

"Depended on achieving a steady social request and a restrained work compel. By shifting the focus of the issue from monetary control and abuse to law authorization, notwithstanding, social capital was spent on manifestations as opposed to on causes. Current dangerous classes incorporate such gatherings as vagrants and packs, and that policymakers have convinced general society certain social classes are dangerous. Contemporary endeavors to manage dangerous classes are noted, including forceful and eager prosecution, legislation, and civil duty. The war on drugs mostly impacts minority, particularly black, communities."
"I think it takes a lot of courage to put someone else\u2019s thoughts and actions before your own in order to achieve that ultimate happiness level. I also agree with Mill that the happiness of a community or a population directly correlates with an individual\u2019s happiness and both internal and external sanctions. For example, if you have a good relationship with your family, the thoughts of them are going to make you happy. This can bring happiness to other families though meetings, stories, and overall communication."
"At first, the arranged-marriage couples may be had arguments, misunderstandings, and disagreements but when they realized, if their relationship is a failure, the families will have a bad reputation, so they try their best to reconcile, slowly lead them to be passionate to each other. Therefore, it is a good way to prevent divorce cases from getting higher."
"Administrators and public officials met with Sarkeesian and made plans to increase security, however, once Sarkeesian learned Utah State allowed guns on campus and the faculty could not guarantee a gun-free audience, she canceled her appearance. \u201cIn that decision, we witnessed one of the first clear examples of how laws allowing concealed weapons on a college campuses can thwart academic freedom and First Amendment rights to free speech\u201d (Sinor). As of 2014, legislators in fourteen states have passed and introduced laws allowing concealed weapons on college campuses. Even after faculty members, public officials, and administrators have voiced their opinion that they do not want guns on campuses, they are not in charge of making the decision. Across the country, state legislators are regulating campus culture, and in doing so they are restricting university officials, threatening academic freedom, and interfering with the education of students (Sinor). Professors may even choose to change course content because of a perceived threat or they may retire early or quit their jobs at a college campus that permits guns."
"Through these influences, girls are taught this is an acceptable way to be treated. It teaches boys that using abusive behavior is how you treat girls and is an effective way to get what you want which becomes how they treat women as adults. It teaches girls that abuse is an acceptable way to be treated and reinforces the notion that when a boy likes you he is mean to you. Whose job is it to challenge these notions? The question of effective interventions to address the battle for power and control among abusers remains. This is not a new struggle; it has remained a cultural issue for decades and only small strides have been made. Change is an intentional and almost inevitable process. In that respect, cultures do not vanish on their own, but they do so in effect of particular policies and influences. We as a society give meaning to words and objects and these meanings haven\u2019t always been there. The process of instilling gender roles and male privilege has become a self-fulfilling prophecy."
"The consistency of the Catholic Church against the abortion has raised questions; however this question was answered by catholic theorist James McCarthy. His argument was based on whether the life of a child begin ate the point of conception or not. It is however clear that there has been no clear church teaching on this matter, there has been lots of argument at what point does a fetus become a human being. Others argue that a person is more than just the biological parts, and believes that a living person has more advance characteristics that a fetus do not posses, like the ability to think and make relationships with other people (McCarthy,1996)."
"Legal obligations underline that nurses must respect and uphold patient confidentiality, not only in the hospital but also outside of work. If nurses do not uphold and promote patient\u2019s confidentiality, the patient may no longer trust medical staff, no longer providing them with essential information concerning their health, therefore diminishing the prospects of effective and safe patient care in the hospital setting. The code of confidentiality states that The people in your care must be able to trust you with their health and well-being. To justify that trust you must be open and honest (NMC 2008, p.1). Nurses must be honest and forward when addressing their patient\u2019s condition, allowing the patient to comprehend the possible outcomes if they do things that will compromise their health. Each hospital has a similar yet different set of code of conducts associated with its hospital\u2019s beliefs and values. However, the major contributor to the codes of conduct that every nurse must abide by is the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA), which identifies the three major standards: the codes of conduct, standards for practice and the code of ethics. The codes of conduct identified how a nurse should act in a working environment with reference to how they treat their patients and each other, it establishes the legal requirements for each nurse, professional behaviour and how a nurse is expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner. The next standard of practice is standards for practice which have seven standards. All of which affect and influence on quality patient care and what the registered nurse (RN) sees best fit to that person. The code of ethics allows for nurses to find time out of their busy schedules to reflect upon what they\u2019ve done or could have done better; reflection is essential for all nurses. It allows them to properly manage their thoughts in a calm manner. The code of ethics also allows for the wider community as well as nurses to understand the standards and values they should expect from their careers and themselves. Hospitals monitor the quality of care and services provided by nurses by allowing for inspectors to come and look around the hospital, displaying any concerns about potential hazards which may include, the introduction of slip-resistant shower mats, cables attached to machines, etc. Hospitals also provide patients with surveys that they can fill out identifying anything they would have changed and anything they were not pleased with, as well as stating their overall comfort while at the hospital. Professional agencies such as the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (APRAH) guide for the provision of safe and effective patient care by their efforts of sustaining 15 national boards including the NMBA which nurses are registered to. The National Registration and Accreditation Scheme (2018) stated that the jobs of AHPRA worked by Protecting the public, setting national standards, auditing compliance, managing complaints (notifications) about health practitioners, Publishing the online register, Accrediting training and education, facilitating a mobile health workforce and Registering 700,000+ health practitioners (diagram 1). AHPRA allows nurses to register themselves, ensuring that they are meeting specific requirements, allowing them to practice; this gives patients and other nurse\u2019s reassurance that they are well trained and equipped to handle the demands of a nurse effectively, since they must meet certain training and different requirements each year including completing Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and having to undergo first aid every three years making sure they are at a high level of personal care and being able to effectively manage and treat their patients when they are found in different circumstances, e.g.) stroke, heart failure, snake bite, cleaning of wounds, etc. APRAH ensures that nurses are performing to the highest of standards and making sure they are protecting the public by taking a nurse\u2019s registration away if they are not conducting themselves in a professional manner or putting patients lives at risk, by doing this AHPRA is minimising the risk associated with nurse\u2019s poor conduct. AHPRA monitors the quality of care and services provided by nurses by registering them ensuring that they are qualified to be working and effectively treating patients. They are also able to remove a nurse\u2019s registration if the complaints made towards them are true and they see that as unprofessional or putting patients lives at risk. AHPRA also allows for individuals to search nurses and discover if they are registered and able to practice, giving peoples a peace of mind. Quality agencies such as the Australian Institute of health and wellbeing (AIHW) guide for the provision of safe and effective patient care by providing nurses with statistics and information. Information is collected by gathering statistics from different communities in order to improve health and wellbeing. The AIHW (2018) stated that Our high-quality, independent evidence is used by many to improve policies and services on health and welfare issues and topics, including expenditure, hospitals, disease, injury, mental health, ageing, homelessness, housing, disability, child protection and the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (para. 3). It allows nurses to read upon and understand new or pre-existing conditions in the community, such as the rise in anxiety and common mental illnesses such as afflictive disorders. The AIHW (2019) reported that Anxiety disorders (such as social phobia) were the most prevalent, afflicting 1 in 7 (14.4%) of the population, followed by Affective disorders (such as depression) (6.2%) (Survey of Adult Population (aged 16\u203385)). AIHW allows for nurses to gather information on conditions and be able to effectively manage it, hence providing safe and effective patient care of being able to bring them back to their original state of health or improve it faster. AIHW monitors the quality of care and services provided by nurses with the assistance of supplying them with statistics and valuable information to tackle new and pre-existing conditions relevant to the communities they are working in, nurses will be more equipped and knowledgeable to address issues in the community and fix it. In conclusion industries such as hospitals, professionals\u2019 agencies such as AHPRA and quality agencies such as AIHW guide the provision of safe and effective patient care in nursing. Hospitals provide nurses with guidelines, the legal obligation of confidentiality, codes of conduct, standards for practice and code of ethics all which is through the NMBA. AHPRA registers nurses ensuring that they are qualified and able to effectively and safely treat patients, AHPRA can also remove nursing registrations if it is seen they do not act in a professional manner or they put patients at risk. The AIHW provides nurses with statistics and valuable information to be able to treat new or pre-existing conditions prevalent to a community."

"1.1 Why is it important to recognise and respect an individual\u2019s heritage? Because peoples heritage is part of their culture. The more you understand about it the more you understand the person and the reason they do some of the things they do. You have a heritage and it is why you were brought up with the beliefs and standards. You want people to respect that, so you should give the same respect. It\u2019s also a part of history which has helped us evolve throughout this world."
"So what is identity theft, how does it happen, and what can Americans do to protect themselves for becoming victim to this crime? Using cash to pay for goods or services is somewhat a thing of the past. In today\u2019s society we use our debit and credit cards to perform daily activities that include purchasing merchandise online, paying for groceries, dinning out at restaurants, and a wide variety of other transactions that involve money. What we may not be aware of is that in performing such tasks we are sharing personal information via the internet which can be stored, collected, and processed which are all opportunities for identity theft."
"That child will tend to be firmly attached, pleasant-sounding in his/her relationships, and tolerant of familiarity as an adult. In contrast, contact with an emotionally voracious grandparent leaves a child underprivileged, anxiously attached, and hurting. The child might feel anxious about starting school and will probably settle with some reassurance. Grandparents are a vital in children emotional development because children begin to learn how to cope with their feeling by observing people surrounding them during early childhood. Grandparents play a part in a child\u2019s emotional development by offering love, acceptance and respect. This is because a child who feels encouraged and supported by their grandparents, who may be their role model, will develop confidents and a sense of independence."
"Unfortunately, many Filipinos think of respect as something that it is mandatory to give to anyone who is older than them. But does it feel right showing respect to people you have seen doing unjust things to others only because they are older? Because in my case, it surely gives me a nausea when I am expected to greet a teacher \u201cGood morning!\u201d when I already heard her telling snide remarks to one of her students before."
"Cell phone use in class distracts everyone\u2019s attention from the class. When a cell phone suddenly rings in class it makes a lot of noise, delaying lecture time for students. Instead of spending time to pay attention to the lecture, many students will spend their time giggling. If students are not able to pay attention they will not learn anything. Another distracting thing about cell phone use is that many students use their phones and text with their friends."
"In a way Jackie makes her mother jealous. Margaret had to wait until she was married to have sex, but Jackie did not. Also Margaret may be jealous of Jackie\u2019s independence because now Jackie is free from parental responsibilities. \u201cS\u2019okay Jackie, you have to travel lots, and your work\u2019s the most important thing isn\u2019t it.\u201d This makes Margaret feel as if her job is not as good and worthwhile as Jackie\u2019s and Rosie respects the job that Jackie does more."
"Many of the facts that are published relate to the point of global warming but are not solely caused by global warming. In an article in The New York Times by Justin Gillis, he explains that global temperatures are the highest that they have been in 4,000 years. He is indeed correct about this, as well as the fact that it may be a consequence of human activity. In the article, he explains that \u201cthe planet will be at least as warm as it was during the warmest periods of the modern geological era, known as the Holocene, and probably warmer than that.\u201d"
"Although Aminata\u2019s freedom\u2019s are restricted her storytelling challenges the power of the upper class and provides her the power, strength, and mindset she needs. In the opening chapter, the elder Aminata looks back on her life and shares her story. \u201cThe abolitionists may well call me their equal, but their lips do not yet say my name and their ears do not yet hear my story. Not the way I want to tell it. But I have long loved the written word, and come to see in it the power of the sleeping lion. This is my name. This is who I am. This is how I got here. In the absence of an audience, I will write down my story so that it waits like a restful beast with lungs breathing and heart beating. \u201d (Hill, 101)."
"The line manager will then invite you to a grievance hearing where the matter will be fully discussed. After the meeting the line manager will, within five working days, inform you of their decision and of your rights to take the complaint further if you are still not happy with the outcome. Stage Two; You will have a maximum of three working days after being informed of the decision to put your grievance in writing to the nursery\u2019s Director of Childcare (Tracy Smith) stating the grounds for the complaint and the reasons for dissatisfaction with the decisions."
"Despite the fact that Will enjoyed his life of literature and education behind closed doors, it was indeterminable whether Will was content with his life or eager to leave his convenience zone in Southie to challenge his intelligence at the start of the movie. For example, while working as a janitor at MIT Will fixes an issue that the current trainees at the institute had yet to dominate, however Will would not admit to the teachers that he had actually resolved it."
"My middle son is a video junky, he plays games, but he would rather play them when his friends are over, he is my more outdoor nature/video boy. My five-year-old daughter also loves videos, but I only allow educational videos, yes some not educational ones sneak in all the time. She does not really play games, she is not familiar with how controllers work, and I\u2019m going to keep it that way. I have read quite a few articles over the last three years on the impact of gaming and electronics; some are peer reviewed articles from SWOCC library and others I found on the internet."
"As Brenner points out, criminal law does treat the use of certain instrumentalities as \u201caggravat\u00ading factors,\u201d the use of which can result in an enhanced sentence upon conviction; this is how criminal law gen\u00aderally deals with using a firearm or other dangerous in\u00adstrumentality in the commission of a crime.[6] This approach could, perhaps, have been taken with regard to cyber crime; we could simply define hacking as a type of trespass, analogous to real-world trespass. The \u201ccrime\u201d of real-world trespass is gaining access to a physical space \u2013 a building or a parcel of land \u2013 without authorization. We could have pursued hacking in an analogous fashion, perhaps prosecuting it as tres\u00adpass and then characterizing the use of computer tech\u00adnology as an aggravating factor.[7]"
"Another form of negative influence would be Dominguez Alvarez, & Loureiro\u2019s, (2012) study on ex-convicts dealing with social stigma. Their research discussed about how consequences and effects of prison life could affect their employment status and their income in the workforce. Not only could this bring low self-esteem and confidence in these individuals, which could lead them to turn their backs on society. Studies that supported how employers show dismay in hiring ex-convicts could be seen in Graffam, Shinkfield, & Hardcastle\u2019s, (2008) article on the percentage of employers hiring the services of former convicts:"
"\u2013 In another book when asked of the likenesses between him and Marlow he said. \u2018It is experience pushed a little (and only very little) beyond the actual case for the perfectly legitamate\u2026 \u2018 I think that any reader thinking that Marlow and Conrad are one and the same would be virtually correct. This means in my view that any likenesses and quotes that Marlow does or says can be directly linked to what Conrad believes in, therefore it is not a factor of how similar the two are as I see them as one entity."
"For my seventh culture I chose Iban. The boy says that he has been thinking for sometime about marrying the girl, but he has not dared to visit her until now to tell her of his intention. The girl may reply that she will marry one day, but marry a man who has done something worthwhile to prove himself."
"Not even the judicial argument can be supported. Why so? Is it not the legislatures\u2019 purpose to decide about laws and punishments? It certainly is. However, it is a fact that the poor and racial minorities are over-represented among the executed. Worse, innocents are sometimes sentenced to death. As long as errors like that can happen, there is no justice in taking a man\u2019s or a woman\u2019s life. An erroneous prison punishment can be rectified. An executed innocent can never get his life back. Death is definitive. Killing can never be just!"
"He is also presented as lonely and isolated because he is dehumanised and separated from the other ranchers mainly because of his race, and he is also presented as weak and damaged both physically and mentally because of his crooked back and the loneliness that he feels. Ultimately, Crooks is a very complex character, one who has suffered and slightly gained but he is definitely presented as a victim of society. Crooks Crooks is a lively, sharp-witted, black stable-hand, who takes his name from his crooked back. Like most of the characters in the story, he admits that he is extremely lonely."
"I am nervous to be in any situation, where I will get pulled over by a police officer and have to consider feeling as though survival is the key. I am fearful for not only my life, but my friends and family lives. As a young African American coming from a majority black neighborhood we without a doubt think that our race is being targeted in these adversities. We stand by \u201cblack lives matter,\u201d because we as a society must take action for our life, and the lives lost through police brutality."
"The impact is that it\u2019s always a black man getting shot because of police brutality How many more must die for police brutality of black men to stop and for all skin colors and races to be equal? How many more people have to be like Rosa Parks or MLK for innocent men to stop be killed by police brutality?"
"Although there are many reasons why people support abortion, one can use a variety of other arguments to oppose it. One of the most common arguments used, is that the developing baby is composed of living cells that will become a person and without stopping the process it will become a life. With this argument, it is wrong to perform an abortion because it is taking away a potential life, giving the child no chance or rights before it even has a chance at life. Furthermore, there are many troubles that women face emotionally and physically following an abortion, short term and long term. Emotionally some women cannot handle the burden of ending someone else\u2019s life and it can lead to depression and a variety of mental disorders. Short term physical complications include, infection of the uterus, blood loss, and even infection of the fallopian tubes. Long term complications include, infertility, systemic infections, urinary tract injury, torn cervix and can even lead to death. Although many of these are complications of pregnancy, this is still an extra risk you are putting on your body. Adoption is a wonderful alternative for woman contemplating on abortion. With millions of families worldwide willing to adopt, there should be no reason to abort a child. There are many unfortunate men and women who are not able to reproduce and giving a baby to a couple who has unsuccessfully succeeded in having their own child is one of the greatest gifts you can give. You will not only save the child\u2019s life, but put it in the hands of two loving parents willing to support and make the child\u2019s life the best that they can. Continuing, there are many more alternatives to abortion, which include: emotional counseling for you and your child, support services for supplies, financial assistance, and support groups. Each which provide guidance, assistance and even comfort to those placed in extra ordinary situations, abortion is not the only option. You are able to get low cost food, free health care, assistance paying bills, and education on how to raise a child at services such as, Women, Infants & Children (WIC), Welfare Agency, and the Low Income Energy Assistance Program. Another example is Planned Parenthood, which is able to provide you with childbirth classes, prenatal services, counseling, guidance, post partum classes, and also refer you to adoption centers. Many women and couples choose to abort babies who are going to be disabled. Doctors often say that the child will never be able to walk, talk or be a normal child. In many cases, they are wrong. The child may grow to be a healthy normal child and overcome a problem that might have been said to be unsolvable. Miracles happen daily, sometimes a child only lives a short life, and others pull through and grow up to be strong motivated individuals who are able to talk about what he or she has overcome. Regardless to any of these circumstances, a child deserves a chance in the world and a chance at life. Furthermore, happiness cannot be determined before a child gets a chance to live. No one can tell the future, and no one can tell if a child is going to live a significant life or not. This is all relative and cannot be decided by anyone else."
"The older sibling would become their role model because they would have understood that their sister or brother has gone through the same thing as they are going through. When I was three I considered my older sister my role model because she would often play games with me and evoke emotions like joy. When I was starting my first day of nursery in a primary school I wasn\u2019t worried because I knew my sister would be attending the same school so I could run to her if I was scared. Siblings can make younger children feel protected and loved like a parent can do because they have grown up with each other."
"Playing these games can also show negative effects on everyday children\u2019s lives. It can cause children to have lower grades. This is because the children seem to spend less time studying and reading, and more time playing games and watching television. Not only does it affect children\u2019s grades and social skills, but it also decreases the amount of sleep that a child needs. This could lead to major problems in the future. Studies show that a huge problem with the time spent on these gaming systems and television is that they tend to lead to obesity in children; this is because of the lack of exercise and physical activity they do."
"The death penalty or capital punishment is a punishment by death against criminals who commit capital crimes against the society. The death penalty has been around for as long as the 18th century and the death Penalty in the Philippines has different history and is currently suspended as of 2006. With that history, it is very popular with the majority of Filipinos. Maybe it feeds the human to feel scared in doing crimes but Filipinos have mixed opinions about the death penalty, with many opposing it on religious and humanitarian grounds, while some advocates see it as a way of deterring crimes."
"According to the article, NTUC assistant director, Amy Cheong, was sacked after she posted offensive comments online. She put up a public status on her personal Facebook timeline, complaining about a Malay wedding that was being held at a void deck near her home. In her status, she related Malay weddings to high divorce rates, and asked how society could \u201callow people to get married for 50 bucks\u201d, peppering with vulgarities. She also allegedly wrote, \u201cVoid deck weddings should be banned. If you can\u2019t afford a proper wedding then you shouldn\u2019t be getting married.\u201d Cheong\u2019s Facebook account has since been deactivated, and she has apologised publicly. However, her post has sparked a furious backlash from the citizens."
"Griffith\u2019s reaction to the negative feedback towards his film was one of shock as he believed he was carrying out a selfless and honourable function for the nation through his film. The Rise and Fall of Free Speech in America was a response released by Griffith which incorporated the opinions of academic historians that supported the version of history which his film encompassed. He was so affected by such a negative reaction that his next film named Intolerance was released as a response to his heated critics. Although Griffith moved on to other projects, the conflict concerning this film persisted, continually reignited by the numerous re-releases of the film which ensured the issues it raised remained in the minds of both the film\u2019s fans and critics alike for the decades that followed. Before examining the racist content which exacted such a heated response from those who viewed The Birth of a Nation, it is important to identify the innovations, refinements, technical effects and artistic advancements it contained which would influence the development of all future films and enthuse film scholars to agree that \u201cit is the single most important and key film of all time in American movie history\u201d (Dirks). Although The Birth of a Nation rightfully deserves the esteem in which it is held for the ways it changed the language of cinema, it is essential to remember that Griffith himself did not invent all of the techniques used in his work. Many of the techniques and innovations visible in his work had been introduced by filmmakers of the early 1900\u2019s such as Georges Melies or Griffith\u2019s under-rated cameraman and primary collaborator Billy Bitzer. Importance is found rather in The Birth of a Nation as it is here such innovations and techniques culminate and are improved upon in order to communicate the kind of narrative that cinema had been moving towards since its existence. Examples of such innovations incorporated within this film include night-time photography made possible through the use of magnesium flares fired into the sky and the use of hundreds of extras to re-create battle scenes which greatly enhanced the spectacle of the scenes created. The film was also one of the first to utilise an original score along with the use of elaborate intertitles which contributed to the depth of the narrative created. Griffith displayed the effectiveness of parallel editing in his film where through the acceleration of fast cuts between shots he was able to create scenes of suspense which rose to a climax, as visible in one of the final scenes where the Klu Klux Klan is seen speeding to the rescue. Another innovation which Griffith used to construct his narrative was the use of flashbacks, or \u201cswitchbacks\u201d as he called them, which are extremely common in films today. The use Griffith made of camera angles and distances was both highly innovative and influential, but more importantly was highly effective throughout The Birth of a Nation whether it be concerning the intimate close-ups of someone\u2019s face to convey subtle emotions, or the contrasting long shots of battles allowing the action to occur on multiple planes of vision simultaneously. Because many of these techniques are now standard features of films but first came together in The Birth of a Nation, countless directors owe their technical knowledge of cinematography to Griffith and the cohesiveness of his film."
"Another benefit that comes from actively playing is the interactions with others which provides much-needed social skills. Having a place for the children of the community to come together and make new friends while playing is likely to bring a sense of belonging to them. According to Khaidzir Haji Ismail, Abdul Rahman Ahmad Badayai, and K. Rubini Kulasingam from the Centre of Psychology and Human Well-being, they state in their article, \u2018Children Development and Well-being: A Review of Environmental Stressors in Children Physical Environment,\u2019"
"Even more crucial, animal research informs clinical research by building the foundation of biological knowledge\u201d (Musch et al). There are so many things that the testing of animals can help to improve. Some things, such as the development of insulin, antibiotics, vaccines, and drugs with high mortality rates, are all because of high contribution from animal testing (Murnaghan). On the flip side though, Alison Abbott points out, \u201cEvery time you reach for an eye drop or reapply a lip salve, you do so confident that the chemicals they contain are safe to use."
"They absorb everything they see and hear. They best learn through touch, sight, and sound. Using a device such as a touch I-pad, or I-phone a child can interact on their level. There are so many Apps available for children of all ages. They will help a child develop at their capability and speed, while learning. I feel they will absorb more knowledge with a educational hands on device rather then TV. Children have to interact and use their brains in order for the App to work."
"The tone of each poet in the poems, many similarities become evident. Both poets portray a sad and guilty tone when talking about mice. When Barbauld begins to write about what she believes the mouse is feeling inside of the test cage, the reader gets an idea how the poet may also feel."
"It is important throughout our work as practitioners that we are aware of the fact that a child/young person will experience some form of prejudice and discrimination through their time in schools and also that as children get older prejudices and discrimination can get worse and have more serious consequences. Children and young people can experience prejudice and discrimination in many ways. Prejudice is when you have preconceived negative thoughts or beliefs about individuals who belong to a particular group and discrimination is led behaviour or actions motivated by unfair\u00a0beliefs \u2013 this can be directly or indirectly. Direct discrimination can be: A child not being allowed to access part of the curriculum or school activities because of their race, gender or disability. Child not being allowed to join in because of their religion Child not being accepted because of special education needs"
"This led her teachers to steer her away from writing and more towards math and science. In Tan\u2019s case her \u201crebellious nature\u201d led her to become an English major her first year of college. Many other Asian-American students are not as headstrong as Tan and therefore are often pushed into careers in math and science, this undoubtedly affects one\u2019s identity as careers are a major component of an individual\u2019s life."
"Most often, their families cannot understand what they want so they seek other people who could fill in the void. Many youngsters nowadays are much like Sonny. They refuse to go to school; instead they want to be in a band. Just look at the famous boybands or group singers nowadays, e. g. , Westlife, A1, etc. A good number of our youth develop love for music just like the character in the story. Sometimes they start to form a band and jam. Then, they develop some vices, which they think are \u201cin. \u201d If one does not conform to what others are doing, he is considered an outcast."
"Your paper is\u00a0almost ready. The only part left is\u00a0your conclusion. Now you can wrap up\u00a0all your arguments and put them into several summarizing sentences. The last paragraph of\u00a0the entire essay will have a\u00a0paraphrased thesis and final thoughts on\u00a0your ideas. There should be\u00a0some transitions between the claims to\u00a0keep it\u00a0smooth."
"The imagery of racism is further depicted when Brabantio, the father of Desdemona, learns that his daughter had married Othello. Iago urges Brabantio by stating several racist phrases about the union of Othello and Desdemona.\u201cAwake the snorting citizens with the bell,/ Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you\u201d (1.1.87-88); In other words, Iago advises Brabantio to break the marriage of Othello and Desdemona before they produce black children. \u201cWe come to do/ you service and you think we are ruffians, you\u2019ll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse; you\u2019 ll/ have your nephew neigh to you\u201d (1.1.106-109); In other words, Iago states that their union will result in a family of horses. This further reveals how Shakespeare used imagery to show the perception of black people as animals. Brabantio has constantly made it known that he does not want Desdemona to be married to a black man, for he believes that would be going against nature. He is so blinded by the fact that Othello is black that he does not see him as a noble General who should be highly respected."
"NORFOLK: Prisoner at the bar, you have been found guilty on the charge of High Treason. The sentence of the court is that you shall be taken from the Court to the Tower, thence to the place of execution, and there your head shall be stricken from your body, and may God have mercy on your soul!"
"This article covers psychopath\u2019s connection to behavioral traits and personality traits. This links it to the paper at hand due to the fact it further discusses personality traits and behaviors of sexual predators. It further discusses criminal predatory behaviors such as various sexual tactics and other problematic sexual behaviors. Myers, M.D., W. C. (2004). Serial murder by children and adolescents. Behavioral Sciences and the Law, 22, 357-374. doi:10.1002/bsl.590"
"The death penalty was made for cases like Cruz\u2019s. In the instance of the death penalty, the defendants life is taken for the victims lives. Defendants get executed for murdering one victim so Cruz should get executed for killing seventeen and injuring another seventeen. \u201cThe Case For Life For Nikolas Cruz\u201d written by Sun Sentinel Editorial Board quotes State Attorney Mike Satz. Satz states,\u201cThis certainly is the type of case the death penalty was designed for. This was a highly calculated and premeditated murder of 17 people and the attempted murder of everyone in that school\u201d(7). This shows that the prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Cruz because of his premeditated actions. The Washington Post released an article with footage recorded on Cruz\u2019s phone called \u201cParkland Suspect Detailed Plans in Chilling Videos: \u2018I\u2019m going to be the next school shooter\u2019\u201d. In the video Cruz talks about his plans to be the next school shooter of 2018. He shows very little emotion when explaining his ideas but there is a sense of joy in his eyes. Cruz states, \u201cMy goal is at least 20 people with an AR-15 and a couple tracer rounds.\u201d As the video goes on he calls his plans to shoot up Stoneman Douglas a \u201cbig event\u201d. Cruz states, \u201cWhen you see me on the news, you\u2019ll all know who I am.\u201d After smirking, Cruz lets out a soft yell saying \u201cYou\u2019re all going to die\u201d. He follows that statement with gunshot noises\u2026Phew Phew Phew. He claims he can\u2019t wait (Berman). Cruz\u2019s videos allow viewers to see what kind of person he is; cruel, bitter, and compulsive. Cruz is very aware of what his actions will cause in the future. He is capable of planning a massacre and knows there will be deaths, fame, and consequences. Cruz\u2019s actions must result in the death penalty due to how many people were affected and how cruel the crime he committed is."
"This increases Stephen\u2019s feeling of isolation. Stephen\u2019s inability to form a bond with his father causes him to sin, in the form of a prostitute. Although he longs to escape the filth and poverty of Dublin and pursue truth, beauty, and love, his quest takes a detour in a short-lived moment of physical gratification in the welcoming and seductive arms of a Dublin prostitute. He uses the prostitute as a substitute for the comfort he cannot find in his family. This act of lust continues in a downward spiral in Chapter 3 as Stephen\u2019s despair causes him to lose hope in repentance as he began \u201cto sin mortally not once but many times and he knew that, while he stood on the edge of eternal damnation.\u201d This stage of depression continues as Stephen realizes he has become contaminated in every kind of sin, as he thinks over the sentence of Saint James, which says, \u201cthat he who offends against one commandment becomes guilty of all had to him first a swollen phrase until he had begun to grope in the darkness of his own state.\u201d Stephen indirectly blames these actions upon his father as he, out of fear and humiliation, is afraid of becoming a man like his father, a failure in his own eyes. Another way that Stephen\u2019s family comes into his life is through Daedalus, Stephen\u2019s mythical namesake."
"The author through the presentation of the relationship between dreams and reality and the concept of destiny linked to the notion of lack of control reveals the true self by inquiring into the inner darkness of the nature of his characters. He explores the unconscious side of an individual, which in his writing has a significant impact on the building of their fate implicitly blurring the boundary of importance between thought and action."
"It may further be inferred that for him, political, economic and social change can best be achieved not through violence [and that the government should not keep itself busy from going to war, as in the case of the Vietnam War] nor by transforming a portion or a sector of society but what is needed is a restructuring of the society as a whole. King believed that a \u201crevolution of values\u201d is a matter of strict necessity. King\u2019s views may be identified as \u201cradical\u201d in this sense."
"For example is the conversations of her and Jed. She thoughtfully uses the perspectives of the father who is Westerner and the mother who is Chinese to critically point out the differences Amy Chua tries to tell the audiences. Amy Chua simply puts whoever reads this piece in her own shoes so that they can understand what Amy Chua was thinking while the conversations are taking place."
"As gat opened his eyes, he saw an image forming in front of him. He described him as a man with broad body, fair complexion, having big biceps and a scary expression written over his face. If he can clearly remember, it was his professor in socsci who will surely hunt him down for wandering again as his class is going on."
"One Hundred and Sixty acres of farmland beckoned these earliest settlers to the new west, and they arrived anxious to begin new lives in America. The power of David Laskin\u2019s story lies in his ability to bring the families and victims to life, through his artful crafting of words and descriptions."
"Our identity is constantly changing; we never truly know who we are. In many movies and books we often see the line \u201cI need to go and find who I really am.\u201d In our society, we understand and relate to the ambition of finding oneself. We also recognize that it is not suggesting that we have misplaced our body or left it behind but that we need to realize our true identity and learn who we are. Identity is defined as the combination of personal, social and cultural experiences that combine to form an individual\u2019s identity."
"The ingredients in vaccines are safe in the amounts used. The ingredients can be harmful but only in large doses but they are not used in harmful quantities. Children are exposed to one of the ingredients in breast milk and baby formula. Paul Offit, MD, notes that children are exposed to more bacteria, viruses, toxins, and other harmful substances in one day of normal activity than are in vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires up to 10 or more years of testing for all vaccines before they are licensed, and then they are monitored by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the FDA to make sure the vaccines and the ingredients used in the vaccines are safeVaccines can cause serious side effects to the human body."
"According to Child Soldiers International, most of Europe and Africa have now adopted the Straight 18 standard, which prohibits people under the age of 18 to join state armed groups. However, Australia, China, France, Germany, Saudi Arabia and the USA allow enlistment from the age of 17. Brazil, Canada, and the UK allow enlistment from the age of 16. Children fight on the front lines, participate in suicide missions, act as spies, messengers or bomb makers, serve as human shields and are used for sexual purposes. For example, during the Iran-Iraq war, child soldiers were sent out ahead in waves over minefields."
"Besides jealously, workplace bullying can be caused by a person\u2019s personality and feelings of one self. Job insecurity is another cause of workplace bullying. Cuyper, Baillien, and De Witte state that employees with insecurities feel a sense of rivalry with their fellow employees (2009). These bullies try to compete and strive to be a superior employees. Workplace bullies, who result because of job insecurity, prosper when there are no consequences for their behavior. If management does not have expectations on co-workers\u2019 treatment, workplace bullying will continue."
"Also depicted in stories and films of the Devil, he often uses items of desire against the characters to lure his victims into doing as he pleases. Arnold Friend uses his brightly painted open jalopy as a tool to tempt Connie into going for a ride with him. Connie finds some humor in the written messages, but especially the \u201cDONE BY A CRAZY WOMAN\u201d on the rear fender (192). In fact, she finds every part of his jalopy attractive: its hilarity, its splendor, and its deep mysteriousness. However, the same idea is true with the story of Adam and Eve. The Devil, which is disguised as a snake, used the desire of fruit to persuade Eve to defy God\u2019s wishes."
"In conclusion, it would seem that the nuclear family was the most popular family format in the 1950\u2019s and has been a form of living for hundreds of years, and although it may become less popular due to the increase in divorce, rise in reconstituted families and those more infrequent family types such as gay/lesbian headed families, there is no reason for it to become a thing of the past. So although there are now more variations in family type it is still the nuclear family that is most prominent."
"\u201d to \u201cthose pretty eyes. \u201d If you read this passage you will definitely notice that the writer repeats the word \u2018different\u2019 side by side with a positive word like \u2018beautiful\u2019. The writer does this, I think, to reinforce the idea of indirect racism that existed at that time, the kids were so brain washed and sampled to believe that the perfect model of everything was a white figure with blue eyes and blonde hair that they blamed the problems in their life for not being in the range of the elite or perfect."
"It is this second, fuller, concept of \u2018fatherhood\u2019 that I am in favor of, although I also realize how difficult it is to achieve sometimes. The economic and employment situation in many countries means that jobs are getting more, not less, stressful, requiring long hours and perhaps long journeys to work as well. Therefore it may remain for many a desirable ideal rather than an achievable reality."
"Wong (2018) enumerated 12 skills that good parents possess, most of which focus on the child\u2019s positive behavior, teaching them to view challenges positively, helping them develop social skills, opting for guidance over control, providing a sense of security, developing the child\u2019s resilience and perseverance, and management of one\u2019s own stress. Parents do not live only for themselves. Depending on the number of children, they are also held accountable for the lives of their children as well. In a web article by Garvin and Margolis (2015), they discussed the role of an adviser stating that \u201cwhile you provide oversight and guidance, your ultimate goal is to empower the seeker to act independently."
"\u201cTurning gloom into boom\u201d was my 7th grade business mantra. My middle school snack store closed in the middle of the school year without warning, and this unfortunate development spurred the necessity to create a student run snack store. I knew there would be a large demand, especially in absence of any supply, so I decided to start an onsite snack store. With a $20 investment and a cost break edge of buying in bulk from Sam\u2019s, I started my own business."
"Some people seem to think racism in schools died out a long time ago. This statement couldn\u2019t be more wrong. Racism in the learning environment is more evident than ever, and it needs to be stopped because it affects the way students learn and their success. There are many stories and incidents where discrimination has occurred and the effects they have had on students. Take the art teacher from Chicago for example."
"That was why at that time my results sort of fumbled (as I was half-hearted about the whole studying affair \u2013 to me, studying what I had no interest in was an \u201cinsult to my integrity\u201d. ). I also wanted to get away from my family (which was one of the catalysts which caused Christopher McCandless to make such a decision, he was very upset by certain things he found out about his parents), so for a period of time I was staying in the hostel. During that time, I really planned to eventually leave my family once I have the financial means and stay outside."
"In the beginning of the essay Critser says, \u201cneeds to promulgate [. . . ] dietary restraint, something our ancestors knew simply as avoiding gluttony\u201d (1). Critser says that no person should be stigmatized for being overweight, but his idea is to stigmatize the unhealthy behaviors associate with obesity (Critser 1). This is an unfair argumentation because Critser uses the inconsiderable word gluttony a few times and is also bias to the idea of anti-fat. This is a mistake by using the fully loaded word gluttony, because obese people have enough on their plate and don\u2019t need any more judgments that obesity implies."
"To conclude, it would be inappropriate to blame a single person for what happens to Lennie. We could not possibly declare that Lennie is wholly at fault. It is a combination of things, such as the harsh society and his apparent mental illness. Steinbeck cleverly tells a story where not one person is innocent. Everybody on the ranch has a part to play in the tragedy that unfolds. It conveys the utter despondency that plagued the itinerant workers of the 1930s."
"South Africa became internationally isolated, due to its principles of Apartheid. The changing world around it began to see the wrongness of racial segregaiton and discrimination. The civil rights movements in the USA were spreading across the worlkd and many african states were gainging independence, such as Zibabwe. The United Nations condemned South Africa and investors in the buisness world were pressured into refusing to invest in South African companies. South African sports teams were barred from international events and its culture and tourism were boycotted. South Africa was also banned from the commonwealth. These international movements, combined with internal troubles persuaded South Africa that its hard-line policies were untenable. In 1984 some reforms were introduced, however many of the Aparthied laws were repeated. A new constitution was introduced which gave limited representation to certain non-whites, although still not the black majoirty."
"For example, \u201cchina men plenty work, plenty money\u2019\u2019 this is one of the reasons why Chinese were treated badly. In this titled \u201cthe Chinese must go\u201d claims that Chinese people are taking over American jobs, the white man has no work, no money and it is all blamed on the Chinese. While Henry Grimm insists that the Chinese are the reason for job loss in America, evidence in the document contradicts by stating that Chinese have no work and no money, this is demonstrated \u201c white man catchee plenty of money\u201d in the play."
"\u201d In other words, natural selection cannot create new species, but rather natural selection \u201ctake[s] away or alter[s] what is already there\u201d (Ham, 77). It is this important distinguishment that is essential to understand in order to recognize what Ham and Ware mean when they refer to natural selection in the remainder of the book."
"In the second article, _Domestic Violence: The Intersection of Gender and\u00a0Control_ by Michael P Johnson also make interesting points on domestic violence but only difference is he explain the violence isn\u2019t based on gender unless it symmetric to one another. In the culture of masculinity and femininity men are the central aspect of abusing women. If looking from a sociological perspective, most perpetrators are men and the victim are women. He uses this concept of \u201ccoercive control as a context for violence\u201d (PG278; Johnson) to explain power and control in the relationship. He goes explaining that the difference between Intimate Terrorism and Violent Resistance. Male are mostly the intimate terrorist who hover some sort of power and control over his significant other."
"On the other hand, this view places the world outside of Europe in a position of stagnancy, with knowledge remaining static unless ideas were learned from Europe. This idea also gives rise to an ethnocentric idea of \u201cEuropean\u201d intellectualism as being the reason for the centralization of knowledge within that area. It also gives rise to the antipathetic idea of non-West European culture as necessarily consisting of inferior ideas which might be described as \u201csavage, atavistic, uncivilized [and] evil\u201d (Blaut, 16)."
"Measure 4 described how A washed her hands attempting the sari method with her mother. As mother washed her hands with her using the happy birthday song to make the process more fun for A. While A can\u2019t do the Sari method correctly, she is however learning through play to practice good habits by her mother. Its all about showing a kid what the next step they\u2019re working on looks like CITATION DrA18 l 6153 (Berstein, 2018)Measure 5 shows that A Built a tower out of Duplo Blocks. This showed that A was using her hand and eye coordination skills. This helps with strengthening her muscles in her hands and fingers which will help with holding other items. CITATION Bru14 l 6153 (Bruce, 2014) mentions that this is an appropriate skill for a child of this age."
"On September 28, 2016 is when I enrolled in a driving institution that costs $500. Within a month, I got my license but had no car, which meant I had to use my brother\u2019s car to go anywhere I wanted to go. I didn\u2019t want to bother my mom and ask her for a car since she just paid $500 to get my license. I decided to ask my older brother if he could loan be some money to buy a car, \u201cOk\u2026 just pay me back in 10 years,\u201d he said laughing. A couple months went by and Christmas time was around the corner. I said to myself, this is the time. Therefore, every time my mother asked me what I wanted for Christmas I said a car. I know she couldn\u2019t afford to buy me a car at that moment, but I always believed in miracles. The look on my mother\u2019s face knowing that her son wants a car, but she can\u2019t afford it was dispiriting. For this reason, I went up to her and said, \u201cdon\u2019t worry I don\u2019t need a car now, I could buy it when I start working\u201d, but moms will always be moms and she knew me too well to figure out when I was lying."
"As a matter of fact, animals are just like humans who require to be treated the way humans are treated. While supporting animal research, Taylor (120) however cites some commentators who argue that the experiment that involved testing cosmetics and other hazardous products on rabbits in order to know how long the rabbits would die was unethical. This experiment fundamentally was meant to test the level of toxicity of certain substances. As Taylor (128) echoes the sentiments of critics, this is an inhumane way of treating animals because \u201c\u2026 the suffering of any being ought to count equally with the like suffering of any other being.\u201d These among other critical arguments have formed the basis of the opposing side of animal testing. It may be justified to talk in terms of animal ethics when there is justification that animals have actually been mistreated. Considering that few cases have been reported regarding inhumane treatment of animals, it should not however justify the lifting of a ban on animal testing. As a matter of fact, animals have helped a great deal in the scientific and medical field which has equally improved the quality of human life."
"Creating stricter gun control laws could also hurt or have no effect on the number of overall shooting in the United States. People who want guns and are unable to obtain them legally, can purchase them through the black market. Most people simply want guns for their own protection and self-defense."
"Belen Sassone discusses women who make the choice to abort. He mentions women don\u2019t procedure with acting out or selfishness, but rather make that decision takes a lot of courage. He explains the clinic\u2019s policies and the process before considered an abortion. The doctor requires information, stating they\u2019re likely to develop breast cancer, have suicidal thoughts, and infertility after having an abortion. He discusses the law-making is a huge problem because religious beliefs have changed it. Religious beliefs shouldn\u2019t affect the law-making because not everyone has the same opinions and points of view on abrtion."
"Marriage before the age of 18 years has a big problem and a big challenge especially for the young girl because they can\u2019t complete the education, they get hurt during pregnancy, and when they get birth even might cause them to die. Child marriages are common in many cultures, and child marriage can be arranged by parents, and that marriage can be arranged at any age."
"An individual experiences upward social mobility when she or he moves from a lower class to an upper class by dint of success in economic, social or political spheres; conversely, an individual experiences downward social mobility from an upper class to a lower class because of failure in economic, social or political life. There is intense debate over the theoretical definition of social class. Classes are usually identified on the basis of the most important criteria that differentiate classes in the society; the number of class hierarchies that exist, the extent to which the class structure is accorded recognition within the society."
"Public awareness of the disorder increased in contemporary times after a case was the subject of The Three Faces of Eve (1957). In the 1980s and early 90s, such factors as recognition of child abuse, public interest in memories recovered from childhood (whether of actual or imagined events), allegations of so-called satanic ritual abuse, and the willingness of many psychotherapists to assume a more directive role in their patients\u2019 treatment, led to what came to be regarded as a rash of overdiagnoses of multiple personality."
"Whanaungatanga: this is important role for every people\u2019s life. According to maori they think it\u2019s all about kinship, relationship between their family, friends, relatives and neighbor by binding a great bond and maintaining relationship via celebrating function, sharing experience and helping or working to gather so it\u2019s helpful for surviving."
"Another important effect is that there is a chance of potential violent behavior of the child. Most of the shows shown on television have a lot of inappropriate content for instance aggressiveness and fighting, even in shows meant for kids. The child sees this and thinks that this kind of behavior is okay. They\u2019re inspired by what is shown and want to try it in real life. They later adapt to this kind of behavior. How much ever the parents try to control what their child watches, there is exposure to inappropriate content. The child may even be traumatized later due to this content."
"The woman\u2019s great fear was that she would not be capable of realizing her drams such as making a living, which contributed to stress relationship with other family members. She was exposed to hush environment full of competition from the male colleagues who had upper hand in accomplishing their dreams. Therefore, women voice about the themes regarding romance and racial personality with regard to female individuality and freedom."
"Stereotype is an image or idea of a particular type of person or thing that has become fixed through being widely held. Discrimination is to make an unjust distinction in the treatment of different categories of people, especially on the grounds of race, sex or age. Prejudice is a preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience. (Source: Concise\u00a0Oxford Dictionary) Stereotype is to decide, usually unfairly, that certain people have particular qualities or abilities because they belong to a particular race, sex or social class. Discrimination is the practice of treating one particular group in the society in an unfair way. Prejudice is to influence someone so that they have an unfair or unreasonable opinion about someone or something. (Source: Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English) Globally, stereotypes, discrimination and prejudice are understood as related but different concepts. Stereotypes are regarded as the most cognitive component, discrimination as the behavioral component of prejudicial reactions and prejudice as the affective. In this tripartite view of intergroup attitudes, stereotypes reflect expectations and beliefs about the characteristics of members of groups perceived as different from one\u2019s own, discrimination refers to actions, prejudice represents the emotional response. Stereotypes are not only harmful in their own right; they do damage by fostering prejudice and discrimination."
"On other hand, we know some people have a bad personally. They we have to keep way from us. They who makes us a bad gay, useless, unhappy, dangerous, and always their have a trouble; whatever times, a bad friends have dangerous idea and they are a big different between a greet friends and a bad friends."
"The rights of the individual immigrants have been historically trumped at the expense of the nation-state rights. The ability of people to move comfortably together with their family which is an ultimate freedom and fundamental for human beings has been denied. (Johnson K.R.71) \u00a0Immigrants have also been discriminated on acquiring educational benefits. There has been a debate on whether to provide education benefits to the illegal immigrants over years in the nation."
"A further feature of a best friend is to encourage their bestie. First, a caring buddy listens to her friend. She tries to understand the thoughts or opinions of their mates. For example, In my group, there is a girl who always listens to others, and tries to help her buddies. Second, a kind friend stays by your side in your difficulties. They help to overcome their difficulties. For instance, when I didn\u2019t understand some homework, my mate explained it to me. She also tells me how I can do that. Finally, they show love and affection with their loves. A supportive friend tries to maintain a close relationship. She has a balance of importance about their friends. In sum, people want a mate who cares about them and also encourages them."
"All of these reason I\u2019ll be sure to make a point of explaining them further and using reliable statistics taken from studies of children of divorce. This question should interest almost everyone that plans of getting married in the future. Divorce clearly isn\u2019t something that couples want or even expect in a marriage but unfortunately such events occur that lead to divorce and it is crucial to know how it may affect children in the long run. David Masci the author of the article \u201cDoes divorce turn children into troubled adults? argues that divorce might turn children into troubled adults, and I agree because he provides viable evidence to support his theory. His argument that is supported by new research showing that almost half of all children in the United States have to deal with their parents dissolution of marriage nd these some of these children show signs of distress in the later year. Mainly likelihood of health, emotional, and behavioral problems, lower academic achievement and an increased risk of divorce when they marry."
"The logical consequences of these discrimination and feelings of inferiority are clear in both readings. Since we are required to believe that the only explanation Mary\u2019s failure is racism, every time a minority is poor, commits a crime, goes on welfare, or takes drugs, the priests and sisters stands accused of yet another act of racism. All failure or misbehavior by the white students, stand as proof that the society is riddled with hatred and bigotry. For precisely so long as non-American Indians or non- pure Indians fail to succeed in life at exactly the same level as the minority students, the Indians will be, by definition, thwarting and oppressing them. This obligatory pattern of thinking leads to strange conclusions. First of all, the racism in Mary\u2019s school is a sin that is committed almost exclusively by Holy people. Thus, whether or not an act is called racism depends on the race of the racist."
"In Of Mice and Men, the fundamental irony is that no matter how elaborately George and Lennie plan their future, and regardless of how strongly they hope and dream their plan wil not happen. George and Lennie are forced to work the land of others, dreaming for the day they will own their own farm. They work hard to reach their dream, yet the effects of Lennie\u2019s retardation, despite him being good, will cause them not to achieve their dream. George and Lennie\u2019s friendship is what makes them unique, yet did not stop their sad destiny."
"Further take into account the fact that Lincoln had surprisingly withheld an additional 33,000 troops from his Army, McClellan was vastly unfit for his post and his army unfit for attack. It is therefore safe to assume that Stonewall Jackson, now serving as General of the Confederate Army, is able to fend off the northern intruders from the capital. A major difference in this world occurs when Jackson, less aggressive and offensive than Lee was, does not recognize the opportunity as the Army of the Potomac retreats and instead decides to remain in Richmond, focused on fortifying his defenses and replenishing his troops."
"First of all, there are those friends that are only seen in school. Seeing them on the street is like they are not even there. One may have known them throughout their whole school career, but have never talked to them outside of school. These school aqquaintinces are nice people to talk to , but there is never an effort to do anything more than that. These friends are good because there are never any chances to take with them."
"and Control Act (IRCA) implement a law that, in order to work in the United State the workers must complete an I-9 form and must be able to prove their authorization to work in the United States to their employers\u201d (Howell 2006). When the illegal immigrants enter America, they do so without any papers or any authorization. This means that there is no record of where they came from or what sort of a background they have. They might be infected with a million\u00a0diseases, such as polio, tuberculosis, etc. These diseases can spread and cause a lot of problems for the American citizens. On the other hand the immigrants are usually skilled labor and they help increase the local production of the United States, also when the businesses pay them lower than minimum wage, their costs go down, which means that the costs of production as well as the prices goes down, and these help the citizens of the United States."
"Six months after denial of abortion, women were less likely to be employed full time and were more likely to receive public assistance than were women who obtained abortions, differences that remained significant for 4 years.This research concluded that women who were denied abortions were more likely than were women who received an abortion to experience economic hardship and insecurity lasting years. This study had several notable strengths."
", what a marvelous creature. Now, you may be wondering why have chosen this topic for a tribute speech, or maybe why I would even consider talking about it at all, but do you realize what an important role these beetles play all around the world. I remember several days when I was young that I would just go for a walk in my grandfather\u2019s pasture."
"That year, Hitler began a boycott of Jewish business. The Jews lost their jobs in government and public services. Jewish children got segregated form school. All Jewish people received a curfew. Hitler blamed the Depression on the Jews, and they became scapegoats. In 1935 laws were pasted saying that Jews were no longer citizens, and that marriage between Jews and Aryans was forbidden. On March, 1938, Germans troops occupied Austria. On November, 1938, the Crystal Night happened. During that night, Germans burned and looted synagogues all over Germany. On September, 1939, Germany invaded Poland in \u201cLighting War,\u201d and War was declared. The same year, England and France became Allies against Germany. On July 1942, Deportation of Holland\u2019s Jews began. They were send to either Auschwitz, or Sobibor, which were death camps in Poland. Today, the Secretary of State is Jewish, and she never knew that. Her family background was from Slovakia, where 83% of the Jews died. She was raised as a Catholic, and her parents never told her she was Jewish. There was a Hidden Child Foundation, which was a place for Hidden Jews to come too. In conclusion, I think that it was very tough to be Jewish during the Holocaust."
"It\u2019s easy to be there for our friends when they ask you out for fun things like drinks at the bar, dancing in the club, or laughs at the theater. But are you willing to be there for the hard times that are the opposite of fun? You might not feel comfortable while spending time with an emotionally fragile person on the verge of tears, but true friends are readily available when they\u2019re needed the most. When the other person is in trouble, a true friend comes to know that merely by listening to their \u201cHello\u201d over the phone."
"The legend behind the carnation goes back to the Passion of Christ. Seeing Christ\u2019s sufferings, his mother Mary sheds tears that fell to the ground. These tears turned into fragrant and beautiful carnations. Did you know that more phone calls are made on Mother\u2019s Day than any other day of the year? More than122 million calls are made in the US. In the nation formerly known as Yugoslavia, children would tie up their mothers on Mother\u2019s Day. The only way she could get free would be to pay her children with treats. Now back to the day at hand, Mother\u2019s Day."
"I am really grateful for being able to stand here and share something to you all, and in this moment, I would like to invite you all to think together with me: what is the best color for apple? You may hold on a little bit on what are on your mind right now, because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to be our topic today."
"In her article \u201c Committed to Ethnicity, Committed to America: How Second Generation Indian Americans \u2018 Ethnic Boundaries Further their Americanization \u201d , Dhingra discusses US born Indian Americans and shows how these immigrants are utilizing selective socialization to incorporate. They are taking what they like most from each of their civilizations and utilizing it in a positive manner. For her survey, she conducted interviews with 2nd coevals Indian Americans who were an equal sum of work forces and adult females, between the ages of 22-33, all in white-collar professions and populating in Dallas, Texas."
"The second novel is Raisin in the Sun by Lorraine Hansberry. It is about a family who is not so rich, they live in the South Side of Chicago. There is the mother, Mama, the daughter Beneatha, the son Walter, the wife of Walter Ruth, and the son of Walter and Ruth, Travis. The father of Walter and Beneatha passed away and now the family is getting a $10,000 check. The family fights for what they should spend the money on, Walter wants to use the money to invest in a liquor store and Mama wants to buy a house in the nice neighborhood with more room, Ruth agrees. Beneatha ends up falling into a love triangle between Joseph Asagai and George Murchison, and can not decide who to go with. Beneatha wants to go into a beneficial college for a medical course, so she can become a doctor. Mama somewhat supports her decision, and Walter despicses it, he thinks that it is ridiculous. When they receive the money, Mama gives some to Walter, so he can transfer the money for the house and for Beneatha\u2019s college. He ended up not entering the money in and is a disappointment to his family. The house that they were purchasing was in a white neighborhood, the retailer was a racist and showed it towards the family. So, with the money they had left, they purchased the house even though everyone neighboring them would hate them, they would not care at least they would be happy in the big house they waited years for."
"My final assessment paper will be focused on racism within the criminal justice system as well as the police brutality that is geared towards blacks. It\u2019s hard to believe we still live in a time where there is so much maltreatment against people of color, but study after study uncovers an inconceivable amount of data that reflects how blacks are put through the criminal justice system at a much higher rate than any other race. They are also more likely to experience police brutality in their lifetime."
"The Internet is based on a client-server model, where every day, millions and millions of computers are accessing thousands and thousands of servers. Many of the things we use our computers for today make use of this model, from web browsing to electronic mail. Over the years, competing models of networking emerged to compete with the client-server model. The peer-to-peer model has been a prominent competitor with vast differences. Mainframe architecture, from which the client-server evolved, still has a place in business today and the two compete on the back-end."
"Tinana:(physical health) according the Maori dictionary meaning of Tinana is the physical appearance and physical wellbeing of a person and how it keeps for good well-being. A good health is giving positive response to person\u2019s daily routine activities. Because if our physical body is not good so it might could be increased our worry and it indirectly affected on hinengaro. In maori they consider their body as Tapu (special) so they always prefer it should be always clean. Moreover, they have some beliefs such as, their hair brush not put on dining table, their head is considered as tapu, they not pass food over someone\u2019s head and tea towels they always wash by hands not included with all clothes."
"Another main reason as to why some people view multiculturalism in Canada negatively is because it creates confusion and misunderstanding. Many people that come to Canada know only their native tongue, and their own countries rules and laws. Being introduced to Canadian laws, language and customs can prove to be quite the challenge. A third reason as to why not everyone supports multiculturalism is because of the fear of eroding traditional British heritage. Canada has close ties to its mother-nation Britain, and many believe that by allowing immigrants of different ethnic backgrounds into the country, the link between Canada and Britain will only weaken (Satzewich, 1992)."
"Social workers are state workers that the government has issued to do a job, but they don\u2019t provide adequate service to those who are really I need. Even in the court house you can witness a judge say that there is not enough evidence to remove a child from and abusive environment, but as soon as they child is severely hurt they want to go after the parent or person who tried to get the child removed."
"They buy books, enter their children into after school programs, and one parent quote, \u201cwas nervous about the exams and had made her son do three practice tests at home in the past month.\u201d It\u2019s clear that parents want their children to perform well. However, this seems to be a strain on the children. If the test itself already covers things that are not consistent with their school curriculum and, by many accounts, are poorly designed then all this does is cause stress on the child."
", a conservative blogger, argues \u201cWe must appreciate police work and improve their training. We should simplify the justice system to make it more efficient and fair. We should also reform the criminal code to make sure the bad guy is punished more sternly, so criminals won\u2019t go back to a life of crime, and reinstate the right to bear arms for good citizens (Salles, 2015).\u201d"
"For more than four centuries, black people have experienced more hardships than one can imagine, from slavery to civil rights to the continued prejudice against them today. They are standing up for themselves with Black Lives Matter. All Lives Matter is racist. Black Lives matter was never intended to imply that on black lives do matter. None of that is hate for white living. It is about realizing that white people already have privilege and do not need to constantly worried if there is a target on their back. It is about recognizing that while our lives do matter, there are other lives right now, that matter more. There are other lives that have been full of hardship, that need help from others with privilege. By saying All Lives Matter, you are erasing that cry for help. By saying All Lives Matter,you are pretending nothing\u2019s wrong. Black Lives Matter is saying that they recognize that white lives already do matter. It is a statement of their lives also matter ing. It is saying black lives matter, too."
"To help the less fortunate is to demonstrate a concern for the welfare without judging them or blaming them for their circumstances. Compassion does not blame a victim, but seeks to offer assistance no matter what the situation (____). Many people lack the resources that some others have, and possessing necessary items and being successful in life cannot be controlled. The desire to obtain the necessary items is not always present, but who is to say that they are not trying? The failures in succeeding lead to negative attitudes towards continuing to give effort."
"Furthermore, migrants have considerable influence in not only society but also economy of both abandoned nations and the countries they are moving to. Although, migration might lead to brain drain and earnings inequality however migration from developing nations to industrialized countries ought to not stopped since it provides considerable labor for the shortage of employees in industrialized countries as well as decreasing the hardship in developing nations."
"The second is the need to re-skill Malaysian for newer jobs as the economy is being transformed. In fact, some adjustment has already taken place amongst Malaysian workers, though not enough. There is no doubt that the inflow of low-cost foreign workers into our construction, agricultural, manufacturing and service industries has acted as an incentive for some Malaysians to upgrade themselves to higher level and better paying jobs as these lower paid jobs get filled up by foreigners."
"Studies show that the children now a day have short attention span than of those children in the ninetieth century and below. Children\u2019s behavior and discipline is one major problem of teachers. Classroom management\u2019s affectivity will only last in a short period too. Why is it so? Does DepEd Order No. 40, s. 2012, DepEd Memorandum No. 73, s. 2006 and Presidential Decree 603 has great impact to children\u2019s misbehaviors? How agencies promoting child\u2019s protection do affect the classroom management? If there were loopholes in the guidelines and policies, how will the teacher implement discipline without violating any rules?"
"The fact is that wealth begins at home. Homeowners have the luxury of taking out a home equity loan if they ever need to. To pay for their childrens school, or to use during a crisis. The reason African Americans are worse off today is due to the discrimination their family members endured that denied them equal housing which in turn denied them opportunities to get ahead."
"\u201d The child discussed in the poem is described as \u201ca pretty boy\u201d, which shows that children are idealised as being beautiful. This boy is a prime example of Rousseau\u2019s idea of the \u2018noble savage\u2019, being brought up with nature. His association with the natural world enables him to understand the names of birds easily and is familiar with all their calls, suggesting his intelligence. \u201cBut knew the names of birds, and mocked their notes\u201d However, the foster mother criticises him, saying he is \u201cunteachable\u201d, because he rejected religion and wouldn\u2019t learn his prayers, showing a very narrow minded view on what education is."
"Any evaluation is super-subjective. If the teacher does not realize how to build an educational process without giving out estimates (I heard that there are such teachers), then this is not a child\u2019s problem. If the child received a low rating, this does not mean that he is bad or does something wrong. There can be one other option: the child really started to ignore his studies. In this case, parents should be on the side of the child, but this does not always mean to tell that he is right. \u00a0This means keeping the home environment in such a way in which he feels confident, calm and can share what he has in his heart. Maybe the child and the teacher have a difficult relationship. Maybe he did not understand something, or he fell in love and did not have enough time to study the last week. There is no such a thing that a child \u201cjust does not want to\u201d learn. There are many reasons. I would like to advise adults to try this situation on themselves. If adults do bad work, they will always find a thousand reasons why they are right, and the boss made a mistake. Why do they act in another way with their kids? After all, they have no one but their parents. They are lonely. Making the child\u2019s life even harder is a strange function of the parents, is not it?"
"The is one word that can sum up what everyone in the text thinks of him and that is respect and you wish that more ranch hands were like him. Throughout the whole of the story most ranch hands seem lonely but Slim never seems too I feel he has come to terms with the depression and accepts what seems to be the inevitable life of a migrant worker and that is too be alone but sees hope in George and Lennie. Also without a character like Slim, Curley would bully the ranch hands and he is so violent you are not sure what the story would be like without him."
"During their efforts to control the risk taken by drivers while driving, Dr. C. Hunter Shelden, a neurologist in the 1950\u2019s came forward and brought about seat-belts as a way to prevent people from suffering head trauma during auto accidents. For this reason, I believe that doctors, the life savers, if given the chance and funding will be able to help the society as a whole survive this national epidemic known as gun violence."
"As Maya grows older, she is approached by more individual occurrences of bigotry, such as a white dental professional\u2019s refusal to treat her. These unfair occasions humiliate Maya and her relatives. She discovers that residing in a very racist society has actually formed her member of the family, and she attempts to conquer them. Resistance to racism has lots of forms in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings."
"In conclusion, from what has been stated above, the main reasons why law has been problematic to be defined for centuries is because of the diverseness of the law itself as well as people\u2019s beliefs, background, culture and society. The law covers innumerable topics and scenarios and are so wide spread and may lead to one to even go off tangent when trying to define it. How law is defined also depends on one\u2019s society and beliefs in order to incorporate certain bits of information that would provide certitude of its definition. The schools of thought have been enormous influencers of the lack of success when it comes to defining law."
"Suyuan Woo, born in 1915, is a Rabbit and Joy Luck aunties said that: \u201cshe died just like a rabbit: quickly and with unfinished business left behind\u201d (p. 19). It is also to be noticed that Rose-Hsu tells that her mother An-Mei had a superstition that: \u201cchildren were predisposed to certain dangers on certain days, all depending on their Chinese birthdate."
"With this comparison summary, in both cases, the working environment involves how employees perceive one another. This is labeled as social cognition and social information processing. Social cognition is the study of how people make sense of other people and themselves. The perception process influences a host of managerial activities, organizational processes, and quality of life issues."
"This leads to early adolescent depression and loneliness (\u201cSociety for Research,\u201d 2007). Children who were disruptive in early childhood are more likely to be rejected and lack friends in elementary school. Anxious children also tend to have fewer friends, although they are not more likely to be rejected by their peers (\u201cSociety for Research,\u201d 2007). \u201cThe brains of young that suffer from anxiety and severe shyness in social situations consistently respond more strongly to stress, and show signs of being anxious even in situations that others find safe. (\u201cAssociation for Psychological Science,\u201d 2007, para. 1) Parenting, family relationships, and friendships affect self-image or self-esteem. \u201cThere are several different sources of strength that the girls need to enable them to withstand the stress. These include having a greater say in one\u2019s own everyday life and getting emotional support. \u201d (\u201cPublic Library of Science,\u201d 2008, para. 5) Body weight affects children\u2019s self esteem as does school performance (\u201cPublic Library of Science,\u201d 2008)."
"In the above case, some of the company employees remained unaware that their identities have been stolen and that too by someone who had worked in their company and was a known person. Kenneth Gibson was sentenced to four years in jail and three years of supervised release with 100 hours of community service."
"The people surrounding Michael and Francis look at them from a negative perspective and tend to avoid them when they find themselves in close quarters with them. Therefore, Michael and Francis battle against the careless prejudices that confront them as young men of black ancestry because they are mistreated by the police and are seen only as criminals."
"Health and Safety at Work Act 1974: The Act lays down general principles for the management of health and safety at work. Since UK began to comply with the Europe Union in 1972, a lot of the health and safety regulations too needed to comply in accordance to this union. This very act also incorporated other codes and practices such as the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations (COUGHS 2002), the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 and the Personal Protective Equipment (PEP) at work Regulations 1992."
"\u201d Some of the most important things learned in a child\u2019s life are learned in preschool through third grade, such as how to socialize with others, play, and other things that help them develop as human beings. In an article from the National Education Association Tom McLaughlin says \u201cWe\u2019re robbing our students of the joy and adventure of learning.\u201d"
"It begins by revealing the juvenile excitement experienced by a child when playing a game \u2013 \u2018Call out. Call loud: I\u2019m ready! Come and find me!\u2019 Through the poets use of exclamation marks we can see the child\u2019s joy at partaking in the game. It is exhilarating and fun time for the child, but it is also very competitive. The manner in which he hides shows this competitiveness; he meticulously hides under dirty sacking in the garden shed and makes sure that his feet aren\u2019t \u2018sticking out\u2019 . Also when his friends are seeking him, they are portrayed as \u2018prowling in\u2019, and \u2018whispering at the door\u2019. This further intensifies the degree of competitiveness within the game."
"The freeze frame helped separate each of the childhood scenes and I think gave the scenes the effect of being in someone\u2019s memory, freezing the scene, then moving to the next one. The repetition showed how a childhood memory could easily be tainted; it showed the difference between someone\u2019s happy childhood memory and someone\u2019s bad childhood memory. The thought tracking of the adults waiting on stage worked well as it informed the audience what they were thinking and how it related to their character when they were younger."
"The next step in pursuing a world where black men are not targeted for the color of their skin is intervention. Once the source and reasoning is established, it needs to be applied to an action. This is the stage that is being showcased and publicized in the media as of right now. Protester, politicians and media outlets all give their piece to this matter, creating a mass ball of confusion. In the midst of confusion good point sare being made like in the \u200bNew York Times article written by Matthew Haag speaking about the murder of Tamir Rice. Haag writes \u2018former Cleveland patrol officer who fatally shot Tamir Rice, a 12 year old boy whose death in 2014 intensified national outrage over the killing of unarmed black men and boys, has been hired by a police department in a small Ohio village\u2019 and that he was not charged for the boy\u2019s death (Haag, 2018). This dismissal of Officer Loehmann\u2019s crime is a clear depiction of how United States lawmakers need to implement stricter laws concerning this matter. Office Loehmann was responsible for the murder of an innocent minor and is allowed to continue working in the industry of law enforcement, that is neither safe or just in the eyes of the law, so why are practices like this allowed to continue? Protesting is a step in the right direction but it is not doing enough to change anything. The intervention needs to come from within. Concerned citizens need to educate themselves then obtain jobs adjacent or in the lawmaking department, changing the system from within. That is the best way that one can intervene and change things for the better."
"The death penalty is a cruel and inhumane punishment given to people regardless if they are innocent or guilty, Most cases of the death penalty are rushed solutions to \u201cClose\u201d a case. The government thinks if someone takes the blame for it the case is closed. They\u2019re plenty of examples of people being put to death with no substantial evidence or reason to believe that they were even the ones who did the crime, for instance David Wayne Spence was put to death in 1997 for allegedly killing 3 teenage girls in Texas."
"Sometimes too much emphasis is placed on the academic part of attending school. What about the other benefits students gain from attending school? Although many would disagree the lunch period being a benefit of attending school, it plays a big part in their academic success. For most, the average lunch period is 20 minutes from start to finish. From the article \u201cChildren Need Sufficient Time to Eat School Lunch,\u201d the following is a 20-minute lunch observed by Heather Harrell (2016), \u201c20 minutes to get to the lunchroom, go to the bathroom, go through the lunch line, eat, bus the individual\u2019s lunch area, and get back to the classroom (par."
"These tools and resources include various questionnaires that focus on assessing or evaluating different areas of life such as the ability of a human being to socialize and empathize with other people, the happiness that an individual feels towards his life, the strengths or strong points of an individual, the pleasure and fulfillment that one feels towards his work or career, the appropriate approaches for individuals to achieving authentic happiness, and such."
"The labor methods used in the late 1500\u2019s involved serfdom, where only a select few would be educated and wealthy. Then the Renaissance took place from 1300-1600, which led to more merchants and artists to become increasingly wealthy. The Enlightenment would then occur, changing views on Catholic beliefs. Children were assumed to be innocent lumps of clay ready to be sculpted into strong adults, affecting child-rearing practices in Europe from being strict physical and educational practices to becoming less intense and verbal, nonphysical implementations."
"In scene four of act four, Perdita shares her view on winter and tragedy. She gives Polixenes flowers and explains the purpose behind them. \u201cFor you there\u2019s rosemary and rue. These keep / Seeming and savour all the winter long. / Grace and remembrance be to you both, / And welcome to our shearing!\u201d (4.4.83-86). Perdita is giving Polixenes the flowers rosemary and rue which symbolize grace, repentance, and remembrance. She hopes these symbols will last throughout the winter, or throughout tragic times in his life. Polixenes then replies with, \u201cShepherdess, / A fair one are you\u2014well you fit our ages / With flowers of winter\u201d (4.4.87-89). He informs Perdita that he is pleased with her selections of winter flowers since he is older and has experienced more hardship in his life. Perdita prefers winter flowers over spring flowers. However, she believes the shepherdesses need spring flowers in contrast to Polixenes. Perdita declared to Dorcas and Mopsa."
"Thus I have a responsibility in being aware of all the issues effecting individuals who are in the need of the support of a Social Worker. My role is to adhere to enhancing an atmosphere of acceptance, tolerance and equality for all individuals no matter what their background. It is essential that Social Workers and those accountable for providing services and support to the most vulnerable in our society, do not lose sight of the fact that asylum seekers, regardless of their immigration status, are human beings, with fundamental and basic human rights, needs and aspirations."
"In \u201cThe Red Convertible\u201d, Henry and Lyman are best friends, and spend every moment hanging out with each other. They are inseparable, until Henrys decision to Join the army for three years tears them apart. When Henry returns, Lyman is concerned as he remembers the \u201ctimes we\u2019d sat still for the whole afternoon, Henry always had a Joke, then, too, and now you couldn\u2019t get him to laugh\u201d (Erdrich, 74). Lyman is realizing that his brother nas changed and is disassociated wit n his tormer selt. Lyman is pain stricken because the strength of their brotherhood was slipping through his fingers."
"While playing with these records, they spun sections of the songs on their turntables and discovered a new sound. They began playing this new sound at parties, and it began to gain popularity, thus birthing hip-hop.One positive message various artists express through their music is nationalism. Nationalism is a sense of pride within a nation and promotes the culture of that nation. However, in today\u2019s society, black nationalism is prevalent which promotes the culture of the African American community. Many rappers have used their art to express this to their audience."
"It is noted that the Metropolitan Police Force accepted this definition and criticism (House of Commons Home Affair Committee, 2009) despite initial strong reaction from frontline officers (Foster et al, 2005, Foster 2008). In academic setting the acceptance of such definition is disputed, however. While earlier journal articles criticized the definition of institutional racism, and sometimes the whole inquiry report, as flawed and problematic (for example McLaughlin and Murji 1999, Innes 1999, Anthias, 1999), later academic articles and reports focus on monitoring the implementation of suggestions and appreciation of changes suggested in the inquiry report. While the definition of institutional racism is not the focus in assessing the overall effectiveness of Stephen Lawrence Inquiry on criminal justice system, how people react with this definition is crucial, and the initial unwelcoming reaction towards the inquiry report probably explains the significant delay in implementing some of the suggested changes. The other focus area on policing is stop and search power and practices."
"They took no interest in anyone underneath them. Under these conditions many people wanted to leave Italy. As mentioned before the bulk of migration was post WWII, this saw many single men coming to Australia and then organising \u201cProxy\u201d marriages, \u201cproxy marriages\u201d were a ceremony in which the groom was substituted, it often took place in the brides home country before she migrated to meet her real husband across the great divide."
"As the USA-Patriot act gained powers of control, the minority communities that were under scrutiny had their due process rights along with the right of free speech taken away and violated. Many South Asian Americans, Muslim Americans, and Arab Americans had been under surveillance and forced into compulsory detention facilities only to be deported under the suspicion that they and they alone were the only ones capable of performing harm and heinous acts. Such perceptions along with many of the statements and sentiments advocated by President Trump display a phenomenon known today as Xenophobia, or the irrational fear of people from other countries. Unfortunately, Xenophobia has been rooted in American history, and some argue that it can be traced as far back as to the landing of the pilgrims at Plymouth Rock even though the pilgrims were considered the refugees fleeing from Europe (Giraud, Culturacolevtiva). It was very apparent during the Civil Rights Movement that the downside of the human condition is that we fear or are uncomfortable with things that we are not used to. Since America is a melting pot of different people, beliefs, and cultures, many things may seem unfamiliar. Thus, natural human behavior is to feel emotions of confusion, anger, and paranoia. These emotions are paranoia are difficult hurdles to overcome for many, and the outward display of overcoming these hurdles can be concerning to those that are directly involved."
"Faulty science: Though DNA testing has been useful in establishing innocence and locating those who are responsible for crimes, the results of this testing are only as reliable as those who conduct the investigation. However experts have violated the principles of the scientific method by testifying about tests that were never conducted, suppressing evidence, falsifying results, misinterpreting test results, and exaggerating statistical probabilities."
"Birth rates in a Britain have declined in the past fifty years due to the trends that have been set in society. Between 1901 to 2010, the birth rate declined from 29 per thousand to 13 per thousand. The birth rate is the number of births per thousand of population per year. Factors such as secularisation, contraception, having a geographically mobile workforce, education being compulsory since 1880, economic burden (changes), the changing values of women in society and the changing position of women such as having children at a later age, and the declining birth rate have affected the birth rates in Britain over the past fifty years."
"Steinbeck could be showing that relatiosnhips don\u2019t last forever, as george killed lennie in the end. Perhaps people knew this hence why they didn\u2019t try to build relationships because they knew what the outcome would be like. There\u2019s more pain in knowing and caring for someone then killing them, than just killing someone without knowing them. Carlson doesn\u2019t undertand this pain, and just continues killing. In the end George is left alone, he\u2019s given up hope on the american dream."
"The interviewees are both significant workers for British Railways, so they should be clear on the matter of how the company should treat discrimination. However they both seem to have different reasons on why the men were turned away, they also seem unsure about what they are saying (\u2018Er, well, erm\u2019) showing they are not confident in what they are saying. Which leads us to question if both men are telling the truth or not."
"Elsewhere in the novel Lennie\u2019s dialogue emphasises his innocence. He tells George that he, \u201cdidn\u2019t want no trouble,\u201d which backs up my previous assertions that Lennie never intended to harm anyone. Lennie also laments that, \u201cI done a bad thing. I done another bad thing.\u201d Lennie expresses immediate guilt for what he has done. His actions, such as killing Curley\u2019s Wife, could almost be described as impulsive. He simply doesn\u2019t know his own strength. Therefore we cannot blame him for what happens."
"The story ends with photos of children running around kicking a football, throwing up gang signs, and sticking their middle finger up at the camera. With no clear structure or evidence, the story whether directly or indirectly, sets out to show Indigenous children having a great time missing school while their families sit around in squalor. As King (2009, p. 21) deliberates, with this sort of pre-empted vision of an Aboriginal family, how can such a family actually be portrayed as ordinary within the media?"
"I will however talk about one of the most heated and controversial arguments of today. Before I continue with the debate I have chosen I am stating that I will not be sharing any of my personal opinions or views on the matter. I have chosen to discuss the debate regarding abortion and the two sides of the argument."
"Hubris in this play is not one that Oedipus\u2019 alone displays. Pride can also be seen\u00a0in this drama in the perspective of the characters trying to evade the oracle which in ancient Greek times would be considered pride in itself because the Gods determined fate and to outwit the Gods wasn\u2019t a wise thing to do in the eyes of the Greek audience. Beginning with Laius and Jocasta getting rid of Oedipus, and later on Oedipus who does not know that he is adopted leaves Corinth to keep from harming his parents. If Oedipus was noble enough to leave his adoptive parents for the sake of the oracle not being fulfilled then he would have been noble enough to keep from slaying Laius had he known that he was his father. The evasion is caused by hamartia however we may see it, as a fatal flaw or hasty judgement, in case of flaw chiefly hubris; pride in trying to avoid what was in store itself led the way for Oedipus \u2018tragic end."
"I am very busy and am very involved in my school and community. On top of my work load, I try to utilize every spare moment I have to apply for scholarships and prepare for college. Persistence is vital in my life because without it I know that I would give up easy. Even when I feel overwhelmed I know that I can do whatever the job is by continuing to persevere. Thankfully, there is only one of me. No one else is exactly like me and has my attitude about life. Growing up in a large family of eight children, I feel that I am mature and have always taken on a leadership role."
"A large number of national songs sing in praise of the nation\u2019s natural landscape, for example \u2018America the Beautiful\u2019 which celebrates America\u2019s purple mountain which stands majestically above the plains and stretching from sea to sea [7] . There are also a great number of museums and theatres that are decorated using landscape images of natural scenes. Such as?"
"For our performance, we firstly had to create a walk of the character down the pier as shown in the painting. Eliot played our main \u2018scream\u2019 character; we had to do this first movement piece to music. To begin our piece, we decided not to have the character walk down a \u2018pier\u2019 but instead to walk through the passage way of a train. The central character had to be slow, and all the other people in the performance were going fast around him, this is so the focus of the performance is on the main character. We decided to show this on a train because we could emphasize the reasons as to why he is depressed and lonely."
"To begin with, my dad is caring. I\u2019m always first on his extensive list. In any rare occasion, my dad is there.This is meaningful because if my dad didn\u2019t have this feature, I wouldn\u2019t be as caring as I am today, and as successful as I am now. Last year on Friday, in fourth grade, I forgot my binder."
"A fatherless child in this country faces far greater obstacles than those with a father present. The data speaks for itself\u201463 percent of youth suicides are from fatherless homes (Chapin); 90 percent of all homeless and runaway children are from fatherless homes; 85 percent of all children that exhibit behavioral disorders come from fatherless homes (Blankenthorn); 80% of rapists motivated with displaced anger come from fatherless homes (Dobbson); 70% of juveniles in state operated institutions come from fatherless homes (Elshtain)."
"What exactly is the death penalty? In simple words, it is a punishment given by the State to an individual for committing one of these crimes murder, rape, kidnapping or distribution of drugs, etc. The death penalty should be legal in the United States of America because criminals should face the consequences of their actions secondly the death penalty is less expensive than life imprisonment thirdly evil should be removed from society to bring peace and comfort to the families of the victims."
"Do the right thing is not a mainstream type of movie since it cannot be classified as a drama, action, horror, family, adventure, coming-of-age, detective, fantasy, love story, etc. It is a kind of film which will hold up on its own because of its customized message for the viewer seeking to elicit more respect for the Black Americans. Perhaps it can be categorized as a social drama, although it cannot exactly fit the pattern because there is no specific social problem which gives rise to the conflict that ensues. In a social drama genre \u201cusually the Champion has a personal stake in the outcome of the struggle\u201d (Create your Screenplay, n.d. ). Although Mookie is somehow depicted to be that champion, he did not experience a struggle in the movie because he was well accepted at his place of work and in the community. The social problem which is raised in this movie is more of a subjective type of racial discrimination since the perspectives may vary with each individual, as well as the circumstances which took place. Such subjective views are manifested by Sal, Radio Raheem and Buggin\u2019 Out. As a whole, the movie Do the Right Thing is an enlightening cinematic reproduction of the situation in Brooklyn during the 1980s."
"Armand has a \u201cdark, handsome face\u201d (Chopin 90). This symbolizes Armand\u2019s hatred and is a foreshadow to the end when it turns out Armand is black. Desiree, on the other hand, is always surrounded by light colors. For example, when she is leaving the plantation towards her death, she was still wearing a thin, white garment, and, \u201cher hair was uncovered and the sun\u2019s rays brought a golden glean from its brown meshes\u201d (Chopin 91). The colors they are surrounded by also illustrate their personalities. While Desiree, who is \u201cbeautiful and gentle, affectionate and sincere\u201d (Chopin 88) is surrounded by light, Armand, is \u201cimperious and exacting\u201d (Chopin 90) is surrounded by dark. The similes that Chopin uses also leads up to support the ironic ending by showing Armand\u2019s emotional changes and Desiree\u2019s feelings of rejection. Most of the similes to describe Armand\u2019s actions happen when he falls in love with Desiree. Even though they knew each other since he was eight years old, he didn\u2019t fall in love with her until they were in their twenties. Chopin explains that sudden love, \u201cas if struck by a pistol shot\u201d (Chopin 88) was the way everyone in Armand\u2019s family fell in love. Two similes that explain Desiree\u2019s shock add to the ironic twist at the end of the story. First, Desiree realizes her baby is not white and her blood, \u201cturned like ice in her veins\u201d (Chopin 90). Later, Armand tells Desiree he wants her to leave and Desiree turns away \u201clike one stunned by a blow\u201d (Chopin 91). This is how Chopin\u2019s use of similes connect to the ironic ending. The main conflict in \u201cDesiree\u2019s Baby\u201d is ultimately race. This story\u2019s use of similes and imagery, along with the setitng, make for a good ironic ending in which Armand is really black not Desiree. Therefore, racism kills."
"Even when a patient has a signed organ donation card, the OPO often seeks family permission to proceed with donation. The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (1968, revised 1987) established that a signed organ donation card is sufficient to proceed with donation, and it has been confirmed recently that such documents function legally as advance directives. In the United States, however, it is customary for the OPO to request permission from the next-of-kin due to fear of litigation.(Hanto MD PHD 2005). There are several states that have passed legislation establishing first person consent. This means that the family cannot override an individual\u2019s want to be an organ donor. Some states have established first-person consent registries for people interested in being deceased organ donors. It is not different from a last will and testament. Each year more states are passing first-person consent laws that are strongly supported by the OPOs."
"Though they have conformed to what media tells about the superiority of American culture, many Filipinos are very flexible in balancing their cultural perspective. They could be easily assimilated but their values remain. In seeking national solidarity, many Filipinos abroad have come together to establish their own Filipino community. In fact, the Filipino-American community is the US is the largest Asian-American group in the country. The size grew beginning in the 1940s when the male workers started to marry and have children. Though they were small community, they were stable (Root, 1997)."
"So that night in the dead of night, he packed his things silently and got up to leave. As he opened the door he heard somebody waking up and then realised it was just Carlson turning over. He stood in the door way creating a breath-taking silhouette of him looking out at the moons glow. He set of on his journey north. He had a picture in his head of what he was going to do. He was going to travel north for as long as his legs could carry him and when he could not go anymore, that\u2019s where he would find his true life\u2019s work. He had convinced himself that his theory will see him through. So he started on the dirt path with a sign post saying; San Francisco. In his head he thought that from there he would try and find a way to get to New York. Where he would fulfil his dreams, or so he thought."
"All the racially bias officers opened up pandora\u2019s box in the sense of all the backlash and riots received after several severe incidents that included people of color. It is documented that, \u201cAn individual who commits crimes is more likely to have a hostile encounter with the police than an individual who does not\u201d(Hassett), though in the off chance the the police officer was racially biased they might \u201cmight well accost an individual who is not involved in a violent crime at all\u201d(Hassett). It is biased that \u201cBlack people were more likely to be killed by police, more likely to be unarmed and less likely to be threatening someone when killed\u201d(\u201c2017 Police Violence Report\u201d). There are several cases were police act out against a person due to the way they look or a police over reacts and then an innocent person ends up dead. Out of a hundred and fifty-nine people that were shot by a police officer a little over eighty three of those people were of some sort of color."
"My father planned our immigration in secret, and I promised not to tell my grandparents. However, I was ripped apart. I wholeheartedly believed I was ruining my chances of ever being successful again. Overtime, I learned that I was wrong. Leaving Cairo to come to the United States was one of the best things that happened in my life. I could not have been admitted to UCLA had it not been for the challenges I faced by moving across the world, the people I met in the United States, the strong foundation I had as a student, and, most importantly, the academic and financial resources I was offered in my middle and high school in America."
"Another type of a family structure is the extended family that extends beyond the nuclear family structure to include other relatives. In this family structure, the grandfather is the head of the family with other members having other roles to support the family unit (Taylor, 2015). This type of family structure is common in Germany. However, these are not the only family structures as more family structures are coming up that include unmarried families, marriages between same sex individuals, and divorced families. These family structures are influenced by the accepted cultural and moral values in different areas across the world (Taylor, 2015)."
"Lennie Small, one of the two most major and necessary characters in the storyline, has a very ironic name. \u2018Lennie\u2019 is short for \u2018Leonard\u2019 or abbreviated to \u2018Leo\u2019 has a definition of lion, has symbolizes courage, rulership and strength, which is a complete opposite of Lennie\u2019s character. \u2018Small\u2019 is also an addition to the irony, where Steinbeck uses this to emphasize his huge physical appearances. \u201cI don\u2019t want no trouble, don\u2019t let him sock me George\u201d. As seen in the book, Lennie is a \u2018coward\u2019, as he has a huge body and strength, yet doesn\u2019t know how to defend himself in certain situations and cannot stand-up for himself."
"For some reason, Edgenuity will not let me submit this essay. The rubric dosen\u2019t show the minimum word count and keeps deleting sentences I have written in. Sometimes it will delete entire parargraphs. So, for this portion, I will now spam random words in order to submit this essay. I\u2019m sorry for the confusion and or inconvenience."
"And what purpose does it serve in humans? To answer the first question, Godbey (2003) presents the following: If you put a person in a dark tank of water heated to same temperature as their body in a dark room devoid of sound, their need for stimulation will be so great that they will usually start to hallucinate. If you are walking down the street with nothing much absorbing your attention, you may start to notice cracks in the sidewalk and make up a game in which you have to avoid stepping on them. (p. 46) In conclusion, humans need stimulation. If the mind is idle then the person will seek out the stimulation in his or her surroundings."
"As a demonstration of my ability to efficiently work in an area out of my actual area of training and an innate capacity to work directly with clients, I work as a Front Office Support Specialist at the Four Points Sheraton Hotel Revere, MA since 2005. In the Hotel business, Customer satisfaction is of uttermost importance. It is therefore my uttermost endeavor to ensure that I demonstrate the highest standards of customer relation skills."
"It is this step that the family learns the dysfunctional schemas that promote chaos and turmoil within the family unit and alters them to a more functional state. Although Amy and Ellen do not live close by to physically be in the session, in this phase they can participate in the sessions via telephone. They are still an important part of this family and can provide Gilbert with support during the caretaking process and the reorganization of the family dynamics. By virtue of the relationship, with regular contact between family members, they can help to manage the presenting illness and promote the progress toward personal goals (Murali, 2002)."
"The is to say, if there are three sisters in the family, each having daughters and granddaughters, the partition is done in such a way that each of the ancestresses founds a separate family among whom the original property is equally divided. The partition of property does not affect the relationship. The members of a divided family are called by the classificatory names, and a birth or death in one family creates pollution to the whole stock. Centuries might pass, but they would remain strictly exogamous groups, and the rights of relationship would continue, though in a lesser degree."
"As the game commenced, the basketball that was being used was known to leak air and had to be re-inflated every thirty minutes. McLaurin, Bobo, and their friend Howard went to the store, the store he worked at, to inflate the ball once they noticed it was no longer able to bounce and interfered with the game. There was a normal procedure that needed to be followed in order to inflate the ball. First, there was a needle that needed to be lubricated by being stuck it into someone\u2019s mouth or having someone spit on it."
"The death penalty also expresses that justice must be done. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth and a life for a life. (4) If Carla Tucker killed a human being, justice means that she, in turn, must be killed by humans. An even stronger argument is the necessity of preventing other cruelties from being committed. Society has to act with fervour against any horrendous act whatsoever. Only the death penalty shows how terrible a homicide is. If we do not answer with fervour to the most bestial crimes, how will youngsters ever learn good behaviour and be prevented from becoming brutal beasts? The fact that an executed criminal will never be able to reproduce his terror is enough to defend the capital punishment."
"Cats also love to sleep and what\u2019s better than a cat sleeping? No mess! Unlike cats, dogs love to bark and run around which can be a hassle to handle. Cats are often a touch easier to potty train making them encounter as being cleaner than dogs. Cats more often than a dog, as cats will sit and groom themselves for hours at a time."
"These computer models can be programmed with numerous variables in order to conclude that the Earth\u2019s temperature will increase or decrease. A computer model is not an appropriate way to measure climate change, because it depends on the person who inputs the data for the model. The Sun plays a significant role in the climate of the Earth. It is constant bursts of radiation that are entirely random and have no typical pattern."
"I had to accept our differences and learn not to hold grudges. She taught me how to stick up for myself even if I had to learn to fight against her. She taught me to know where my place was and when not to fight a battle, especially when it came to arguing with my parents."
"Heracles was so pleased to be aback home with his wife, Megara and his three sons. Then Hera makes him go mad and kill them all. To serve him right for this, the Delphic Oracle tells him to go into service under the tyrannical Eurytheus as a slave. Heracles then completes his twelve labours. For this reason, we can fully say that Heracles had no conscious want to murder his own family and is deeply upset when he finds out that he did. As it was the work of an immortal god, her action makes us hate Hera, not Heracles."
"While Mandela was growing up he witnessed basic rights for blacks being denied things that should be available to both and all groups be limited to whites and forbidden for blacks. Activities such as voting, marrying whites, drinking from same water fountains, using hospitals and an equal education were hindered for blacks and aimed mostly for whites. However, Mandela believed that everyone should be treated equally. Mandela held such disgust for the unfairness of the way people were treated, he stated that \u201cI hate discrimination most intensely and in all its manifestations, I have fought it all during my life; I fight it now, and will do so until the end of my days.\u201d (Biography.com, Nelson Mandela Biography, Biography.com). And Nelson Mandela did just that."
"Aware of own feelings, and knows that some actions and words can hurt others\u2019 feelings. \u00b7 Begins to accept the needs of others and can take turns and share resources, sometimes with support from others. \u00b7 Can usually tolerate delay when needs are not immediately met, and understands wishes may not always be met. \u00b7 Can usually adapt behaviour to different events, social situations and changes in routine."
"And George relied by saying \u201cNo-look! I was jus\u2019 foolin\u2019, Lennie. \u2019cause I want you to stay with me.\u201d. Lennie likes to pet soft things he gets in trouble because of this. Lennie is very lonely because he can\u2019t do what the other men do due to him being mentally challenged and irrational. You can see he is lonely from what he does in this quote \u201d Ever\u2019body went into town,\u201d he said \u201cSlim an\u2019 George an\u2019 ever\u2019body. George say I gotta stay hear an\u2019 not get in no trouble. I see your light.\u201d. This shows that he is lonely and is searching for a friend because he has been left out. This also illustrates that Lennie is an outcast."
"And she rejects her lover\u2019s distinction between \u2018good\u2019 (legitimate) foetuses which grow up to have a birthday parties, and \u2018bad\u2019 (illegitimate) foetuses which must be killed\u201d (Christ 322). Now she is able to act upon her own feelings about what is good or what is bad. She no longer wants to vindicate her deeds by silly reasons. What is more, to reach the redemption she needs to give another life or maybe resurrect the dead one. When confessing that her brother did not drowned in the end (Atwood 68) she shows what she would like to do with the foetus, so the conceiving a new baby with Joe was expected. \u201cHe trembles and then I can feel my lost child surfacing within me, forgiving me, rising from the lake where it had been prisoned for so long\u201d (Atwood 155-156)."
"It is interesting in this scene how seriously Peter takes the \u2018deal\u2019 that they made, it is almost a hint of adult nature, this maybe to show how maturely the children deal with their situations. The next scene contained the fight between John and Peter, this is very important in the play as it is the part in the play when Peter looses his position as the \u2018leader\u2019 and becomes second best and the other characters have another person to look up and start to discuss the possibilities of this new leader figure; who could he beat, what might happen ect."
"On April 21, 1868, in opposition to a bill banning capital punishment, John Stuart Mill convinced the British Parliament that the death penalty is far more humane than lifetime prison. \u201cAs my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton (Mr. Gilpin) has remarked, the most that human laws can do to anyone in the matter of death is to hasten it.\u201d (5) Was he not right? Is it not true that the death penalty in point of fact is a very humane punishment?"
"Currently, the problem of illegal immigration requires new constructive approaches and is closely linked to the control of legal immigration. On the one hand, the tightening of immigration controls and reducing quotas naturally stimulates the flow of illegal immigrants in the U.S., so at the present stage of bilateral cooperation is necessary to achieve a certain compromise on immigration policy. On the other hand, living relatives in the U.S. is a magnet for many Mexicans, so the U.S. government should draw a special attention to this aspect of the question. In this case, the speech is goes not about the closest relatives, which according to the U.S. law have the right to family reunification. In this situation the question refers to distant relatives or friends who help illegal immigrants and, thus, stimulate the process of illegal immigration."
"The Image in my power point highlights you the effects of the chemical levels of a brain affected by depression, student\u2019s way looks fine on the outside but once you see real glimpse inside their mind its whole different story, the biggest issue with mental health in schools is the confidence to approach students, identifying the issue. Talking to students in their mental health and ongoing to talking to their parents, and the way the Staff supportive behaviours impact on a student\u2019s wellbeing and how to raise awareness activities and signposting students onto other sources of mental health in the school\u2019s environment what is the school\u2019s approach is towards the students. Children need to be healthy to learn and then children who learn well go on to be healthy young people and healthy adults and again I think this sort of feeds into that growing knowledge and understanding of what we need to do to make sure the children can learn and that we are responding to their needs. Ensuring that you\u2019ve got a strong culture and ethos."
"The most sad part of abortion that I\u2019ve ever seen or heard of is when an abortionist used a ultrasound of the baby while she was doing a normal abortion and she just wanted to see what it was like so when she watched it she saw the baby as she put the tube in it. The helpless little baby trying its hardest to swim away from the tube that would ultimately seal it\u2019s doom. Once the tube had got hold of the baby, on the ultrasound she had saw the baby\u2019s mouth hanging open and she heard a very faint scream. The baby was in agony through the procedure. She never did another abortion ever again."
"Self image is the same. If a person is not supported or is somehow not allowed to dress, style their hair in a way they choose. Or they are not supported to dress in a way that makes them feel good about themselves, then this will affect how they feel about themselves and also have an effect on how others react to them, therefore impacting on their self esteem."
"Rich admits he isn\u2019t really friends with More anymore, which explains why he hasn\u2019t yet aquired a better job. However, when Cromwell offers him employment he declines, showing that he isn\u2019t ready to become a walking representation of Machaevelli\u2019s theories yet, but later bribes Matthew for information on More which undermines his morality once again. Chapuys and Cromwell also bribe Matthew for information, which shows how most of the characters are immoral (especially contrasted to More) and highlights the difficulty More will face in his newly appointed position as Lord Chancellor. After deceiving More, Rich attempts to convince More to give him a job once again by telling him of Chapuys and Cromwells bribery towards Matthew."
"This method is still frequently debated ( Aboriginal Rights \u2013 EmbraceAustralia. com ) . Lest we forget. that along with all of these events during the old ages of Aboriginal subjugation the indigens were. and still are. associated with many false and insensitive racialist biass. More late. merely in 2008. an official apology was eventually released by Australia\u2019s so Prime Minister. Kevin Rudd. PM Rudd gave a four minute apology followed by a 20 minute address telling many events and narratives of victims."
"By the end of 1854 the two sections, the North (Union) and the South (Confederacy) had actually reached an impasse and that Civil War was inescapable eventually. The conflicts grew stress between the two, the production section of the North and the agricultural South, which resulted in Civil War. Between the North and the South there were financial, social and political distinctions. The North had a variety of goals worrying slavery and the South. The North wished to abolish slavery, stop the spread of slavery in the western territories, and the spreading of slavery in Kansas."
"A person with a valid opinion would have a good record when it comes to their advice, have consistent opinions, and have good reasoning behind their decisions. There are a lot of factors, but initially it comes down to the person taking the advice. The tricky aspect of this is that someone could believe wholeheartedly that they respect themselves, but self-respect is only of worth if other people are able to detect it. Although it\u2019s very much an internal identity, it really is only something of value when it can be noticed by others."
"In 1882, the first immigration act was passed, it was called the Chinese Exclusion Act. This law restricted Chinese to enter the United States illegally for ten years. After the ten years, the Chinese Exclusion Act was renewed for another ten years in 1902. In 1917, another immigration act was passed, it is known as the Asiatic Barred Zone Act. This law prohibited Asian immigrants and people who were \u201cundesirable\u201d to come to the U.S.. In 1921 the Emergency Quota Act was passed, it limited the amount of immigrants to enter the United States. The Immigration and Naturalization Act or also known as the INA, was passed in 1965. It\u2019s purpose was to reunite immigrant families and to attract labor. The INA is the current immigration policy for the United States."
"Time passed and I had broken up with my high school boyfriend and I started dating another guy here at ECC for a few months. I never heard from Isaac once during that time, I was a bit upset but I didn\u2019t pay attention to it. It wasn\u2019t until February 12 that I was on Facebook and I got talking with Isaac again via chat that night. We were talking and asked about my boyfriend, I told him I didn\u2019t have one and that I had given up on guys for the moment. We kept talking and talking and then I asked him \u201cFor April Fool\u2019s we should put as our status that we\u2019re going out\u201d."
"Some of the critical targets are: SDG Target 5.2 address the urgency to eliminate all forms of violence against women and children. \u2028SDG Target 5.3 provides the target eliminating all harmful practices like forced marriage, Female Genital Mutiliation. \u2028Target 16.1 address the violence resolving all the forms of violence and death rates. States are obliged to gather information on forms of violence and death rates and to ensure that."
"What supporters of pro-choice position have to say about how to deal with the right to self-actualization of the fetus, with its right to life, with its right to the pursuit of happiness? Pro-choice supporters proceed from the concept of social development of personality. Since the fetus has no idea about own future, about own personality, then it can not be self-consciousness. Once there is no consciousness, then the concept of consent to it is not applicable. (Jelen & Wilcox, 2003). Are these arguments are more persuasive than the arguments against abortion? Nobody can definitely say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, because there is no one single view on this issue in contemporary society."
"Being adopted has benefited both me and my parents. I have gained loving parents and a brother, they love me and look out for me, worship me, adore me. They have created a family unit that was otherwise was not possibly other than through adoption. It hasn\u2019t always been easy, I know that at times I have tested their patience and vise versa. There were days I thought I would never fit in and i\u2019m sure they thought the same way. I have learned that the mistakes i have made along the way, have a profound effect on who I am today. My parents\u2019 love and guidance helped acclimate me to life in America."
"By 1913 Britain lost its dominant position in manufacturing production to the USA and Germany, however at the time remained the world\u2019s largest exporter (Aldcroft, 1983, pg 9). In 1913 Britain\u2019s share of world manufacturing production 14. 0%, 36% for the USA and 15. 7% for Germany, by the end of the 1930\u2019s Britain held a mere 9%, with the USA, Russia and Germany as the three largest producers (Aldcroft, 1983 pg10)."
"The famous Gettysburg Address is a speech that U.S. President Abraham Lincoln delivered during the American Civil War at the dedication of the Soldiers\u2019 National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on the afternoon of Thursday, November 19, 1863, four and a half months after the Union armies defeated those of the Confederacy at the Battle of Gettysburg. It is one of the best-known speeches not only in American history but also throughout the world."
"An example of a symbol could include Jesus\u2019s life because since the beginning of the book the narrator believes \u201che\u2019s the chosen one\u201d. Once he gives his speech at the Battle Royale, the people around him start believing this as well. Not only is he seen as the chosen one but someone in the crowd points out, \u201cHe\u2019s a good speech and someday he\u2019ll lead his people in proper paths\u201d (Ellison 32). As the narrator is finding himself he can portray Jesus\u2019s life. Chapter 11 can be depicted as Jesus\u2019s birth because the narrator is starting to get involved in the Brotherhood. Chapter 13 can be depicted as Jesus gaining disciples because as the narrator gets more involved in the Brotherhood the more he puts himself out there and finds a place."
"A lot of children, especially those living in cities, may be very limited when it comes to outdoor space. Without safe and adequate surroundings, children\u2019s development could be hindered. The residents of Franklinton, Louisiana should consider investing in the revitalization and expansion of its current playground to benefit the younger generation of the community through the use of volunteers, fundraisers, and grants available for community projects."
"The first work of art is the Venus Urbino by Titian which shows one of the many representations of women. The Venus of Urbino was created by Titian whose full name is Tiziano Vecellio. Wethey states \u2018Titian was an Italian Renaissance painter born around the late 1400s in a small village named Pieve di Cadore\u2019 (\u2018Titian\u2019)."
"The Elysium is also referenced in the native title Die Zauberflte (The Magic Flute), by an influential composer of the classical era Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. He has described what it feels to have the dream girl, the main idea is to live life as a wise man and to feel like one is in Elysium. The characters involved are a fine-looking prince, a princess who has been kidnapped, a troubled queen, and a faithful partner of the prince to create the fanciful imagination in the play the magic flute. There is a beautiful account for the beautiful description of the girl as he stated the fanciful of beauty the old and forehead as Elysium fields. Hairs referred to as garden lands, this unique performance of the Mozart is a combination of melody, mystic, fairy tale, and myth to convey the message of love, it concurs all. It is conducted by Thierry Fischer the music director of Utah Symphony."
"Anyone who has identified an act or something that goes against ethics is a stakeholder. The people standing to gain or are involved in the unethical actions are stakeholders, the owner, and those who have lost something due to the unethical treatment with special treatments and favoritism. So, this includes the characters Jane, Brad, Eddie, Greg, and those who are not directly aforementioned."
"It is still a step in the right direction. Travellers Travellers are an indigenous ethnic group. Some dispute this status but travellers have a distinct culture custom and tradition. They are the most victimised and marginalised ethnic group in the country. The European Parliament Committee of Inquiry on Racism and Xenophobia 1991 declared that; \u201cThe single most discriminated against ethnic group is the \u2018Travelling People'\u201d."
"Edward Shorter agrees that women of the upper class in the nineteenth century underwent a female emancipation along with the slave emancipation, but he says that it doesn\u2019t account for the women with families. Young, low status women underwent a radical movement in female emancipation in the late eighteenth century because of the involvement in the economy of the market place. This emancipation started with the young women of low status to older women of higher status. There were some general characteristics describing women during this time."
"Research done by Childwise in 2015 showed that kids aged five to sixteen spend an average of 6.5 hours using technology screens each day (Habyts, \u201c5 Shocking Facts About Screen Time and Kids Health\u201d). Children are using technology constantly which is negatively affecting their health. Young people who should be perfectly healthy are giving themselves problems with their eyesight, weight, and, and sleep. What they are using technology for is even more alarming. Video games and social media are consuming kids lives and they can brainwash children by introducing them to violence and inappropriate images."
"The Kansas-Nebraska act allowed new upincoming territories to decide whether they wanted to be a free or slave state by general sovereignty. This act served to repeal the Missouri Compromise of 1820 which would not let slavery be in the north. After the Kansas-Nebraska act was passed, pro-slavery and anti-slavery people rushed into settle in Kansas to effect the vote. The vote was invalid, this resulted in two opposing legislatures in Kansas. Violence erupted, the territory soon earned the nickname \u201cBleeding Kansas.\u201d Pro-slavery supporters won another election. But again the election was because of voter fraud. Kansas was not allowed to become a state until 1861, when Kansas was admitted to become a free state."
"This is our first way of proving the point that we established above \u2013 that food is viable factor to see in understanding one\u2019s culture or one\u2019s family. Another notable proof of the relationship of food and culture is the case of the Carolina Rice. As discussed in Shange\u2019s essay, rice, more particularly the Carolina rice reached a great demand in the 1700s. Because of this, the slaves who came from West Africa are priced better than their other counter parts. This is because of a more complex knowledge and skill that is required in growing rice. The slaves who grew from rice countries are priced better."
"The last shot of the film focuses once again closely on the clock. But in this frame it has suddenly stopped. Derek\u2019s time is up! Special FX are particular to each film and in \u2018Let Him Have It\u2019 the most significant effect is the period detail. The film was set in 1952 so the detail of clothing, hairstyles and everyday objects have to be specific to the period of time. The clothing that is worn seems to be very dull, especially in the \u2018Cheerio\u2019 section, reflecting the mood of the film. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any bright colours and most of the clothes are of the same style."
"So, people can be happy if they have something to strive for and something to laugh about. But is that it? Can people with goals and a sense of humor still be unhappy? Well, yes. After all, the final key to happiness is the decision to be happy. Human nature can see negative energy anywhere. People can fixate on problems instead of solutions. At the end of the day, \u201chappiness depends upon us.\u201d (Aristotle). Most people are as happy as the actually believe deep down inside."
"This relates well to the topic of Institutional racism because in this case racism is in a school setting where all pupils are supposed to be treated fairly irrespective of their race. But in this case black Caribbean\u2019s are discriminated upon and this has subsequently resulted to their poor performance in school."
"The madness within the castle reduces her to the same state and like Denmark itself dies. A case of innocence robbed? No a case of innocence mislead, but with out this innocence does she become a \u201cwanton whore\u201d? I\u2019m not sure what to think I\u2019m left wondering what Shakespeare intended. This Shakespeare play presents more questions than it answers and with out the answer I am still unsure on Ophelia\u2019s intended character."
"For example, Cuba has a communist government that forces people to agree with the government. Where people do not agree with the government\u2019s views or decisions they are not allowed to express their opinion. People from Cuba are force to leave the island if the government finds that they are looking for options to leave or trying to take action against the government. On the other hand, there are people in Cuba that are happy with the government. They do not have any decider to leave the island."
"\u2018If music be the food of love, play on;\u2019 The play begins with a metaphor comparing music to food this helps to express Orsino\u2019s feelings as when people are in Orsino\u2019s situation they tend to indulge in food similarly to Orsino\u2019s self-indulgent. Orsino\u2019s self-indulgent is the main focus of Act 1, Scene 1 and creates a dramatic effect to the very beginning of the play as the audience are humoured by the drama of Orsino\u2019s character."
"In the 1930s the country suffered ecological devastation called the depression. During this economy downfall the mid-west prairie state families suffer from a large drought that leaves them with nothing to survive. This terrible phenomenon is called the Dust Bowl. In attempt to escape this unforgettable time, a family called the Joads dream of wealth and success in\u00a0the great state of California. In order to pursue their dream they have to leave their belongings behind. This journey carries death and suffering with it when Grandma and Grandpa Joad dies and many of the family members leave the family. The family left Oklahoma in order to find jobs in California (Hearle). The Joad\u2019s dream, which is well known as the American dream, is shattered by certain events and conditions that the Joads faced."
"Ming was able to role play with his peers as he took on the role of the customer and engaged himself in different play episodes (Checklist, No:14). Social dramatic play allows children to place themselves in another person\u2019s shoes and impersonate them. This will aid in the development of empathy and consideration of others (Elkonin, 1969)."
"Every patient wants respect throughout his or her experience with a healthcare provider. One of the ways by which a healthcare professional can express respect to a patient is by considering the cultural background. A patient\u2019s values, traditions, and beliefs considerably impact his or her perception of health as well as the choice of medical care. Cultural communication is a source of disputation to a patient, where one believes his or her feelings were understood, and one was treated with respect."
"Mainstream feminism has a long history of underlying racism. During the 1800s white women were fighting for equality just as women of color such as Sojourner Truth, Maria, Stewart, and Frances E.W. Harper were fighting for universal equality. Despite the immense work that women of color have put in for the women\u2019s movement, it was overshadowed by the mainstream feminists and established itself as a movement geared towards to white women all while using negative racial connotations as fuel for its work."
"Children have a right to privacy. They are protected from attacks in their way of life, their name, families and homes. However, their way of life can be invaded by their parents or guardians if it\u2019s for their best interests, for instance, when parents suspect that the child may be involved in drugs or other unlawful activities they may be forced to ransack the child\u2019s room or personal effects (CRC)."
"\u201cThere\u2019s no denying it: Professional cooking is a male-dominated sport\u201d (Feit). Historically, women have always done the cooking at home but that has been seen as domestic and not a \u201creal\u201d job. According to Ann Cooper, author of A Woman\u2019s Place Is in the Kitchen: The Evolution of Women Chefs, a full 45 percent of people working in the culinary industry are women, yet women hold less than 10 percent of the top positions. \u201cAccording to the Office of National Statistics, only 17 percent of chef positions in the UK are held by women\u201d (Morgan). In the United States, \u201cover 60 percent of women have worked in the restaurant industry\u201d (Schenkel), but only 19 percent of chefs and head cooks are women. From these different statistics, it is clear that there are more male chefs than women chefs, and that the top male chefs receive more praise and success than women."
"When I played the small child writing a letter to Father Christmas, the first memory I played I looking really happy and exited to be writing to Santa and also very much looking forward to Christmas. On the tainted memory I played it very upset and shocked when someone said that Santa wasn\u2019t real, as if my dreams had been shattered and betrayed that I had been lied to about it. For the small child at the sleepover I played it very interested in the story being told and exited about what would happen next but scared at the same time."
"Tourism is a major industry for Miami, and many visitors never see the \u201cunder-belly\u201d of Miami because of the city\u2019s highway system, allowing political leaders to ignore the poorer-high crime areas while catering to these visitors. All this means its violent crime problem is unlikely to abate soon. The total crimes for the population are about one and a half times the national average for all crimes. In reality; however, violent crime in Miami has increased and contributing to this problem is Miami\u2019s growing population. The city has a mixed racial makeup with a large black and Latin population. At the same time, Miami also may be the nation\u2019s capital of multiculturalism of the very sort sought by other American cities as the population changes. Many American cities have encountered increasing problems along with growth. Poor high crime areas in Miami cannot develop the necessary tax base to pay for better schools to education the next generation so it will not have to live in poverty."
"Eastenders style is non-intrusive as mostly diegetic elements are used in the mis en scene to create a sense of reality. For example, there appears to be use of diegetic natural lighting, there are no elements of expressionism in the filmic style of the soap opera. \u201cContinuity editing\u201d (5) is used and is \u201cinvisible\u201d and functions to symbolise a natural link between audience and soap opera worlds."
"The rights of animals are watched out for by organizations dating back to the early 1800\u2019s. I feel that this is an important step in protecting animals as long as they protest within there legal rights. In order to sum my opinion up animals do have certain rights but if experiments, research, hunting and dissection provide positive increases in knowledge that furthers the existence of the world it is a necessary thing that must be done."
"Later in 1990, Doe visits the newly established ECOMOG headquarters but is ambushed by the INPFL led by Prince Johnson. Doe was taken to the INPFL base in Cadwell, where he was tortured and interrogated before being publicly executed. After this, there are a series of peacemaking attempts in major regional cities, first 7 of these conferences fail, ECOWAS the proposes a conference in Banjul, Gambia to put forward the formation of the Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU.) However, the NPFL refuse to attend this and hostilities resume. There are a series of skirmishes in the city of Monrovia between the two major forces the NPFL and INPFL, many Generals and other former allies of Doe also form their own factions including the ALF and ULIMO, for a chance to gain power. ULIMO was the largest of the Doe supporting groups and was later accused of violating human-rights many times, before entering West-Liberia they had fought alongside the RUF, in 1991 they are able to take a lot of the area held by the NPFL and fight with them constantly until 1997. In 1992 ECOMOG declare an IGNU, in response to this the NPFL launch an attack on Monrovia but are severely pushed back by ECOMOG. In 1995 the main groups decide to sign a ceasefire in an event sponsored by ECOWAS the US and the UN, however, this ceasefire is short lived as heavy fighting in Monrovia breaks out in 1996. These fights lead to the evacuation of the city and the destruction of most of the city. The fighting is eventually ended by the Abju accords in Nigeria, which then leads to democratic elections in 1997, where Charles Taylor was elected president. In 1999, the second Liberian civil war started when Guinea backed Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) emerged in North-Liberia, in early 2003 the Movement for Democracy in Liberia emerged in the South, and through 1999-2003 fought government soldiers. The rebels began to approach Monrovia, and from July-August 2003 they besieged the city and shelled the city resulting in the deaths of many civilians, eventually, Charles Taylor was forced to give up office. Under the Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreements, the country began a move into democracy, and in 2005 there was a general election after Gyude Bryant had been interim president since 2003. These wars killed over 20% of the Liberian population, led to mass emigration from the country and marked one of the fastest falls in economy and life-expectancy ever."
"The Labour Process approach was first theorised by Karl Marx. The theory was not a static, universal theory but a historical theory that was revised in the light of historical change. Such scholars as: Harry Braverman, Stephen Marglin, Stanley Aronowitz, Andre Gorz and Katherine Stone have all created their own theories encompassing Marx\u2019s theory during their times, and hence the many different interpretations of the Labour Process (Gartman 1978, p. 1). In general the core notion of Labour Process is concerned in converting potential into actual labour. An example of this is how to organise and structure employees such that the organisation can make full use of their skills. Though this sounds simple in theory, there is an organisational dilemma in how to reconcile the potential inconsistency between individual needs and interests of different organisational stakeholders on the one hand, and the collective purpose of the organisation on the other."
"The fundamental issue addressed by this dimension is the degree of interdependence a society maintains among its members. It has to do with whether people\u00b4s self-image is defined in terms of \u201cI\u201d or \u201cWe\u201d. In Individualist societies people are supposed to look after themselves and their direct family only. In Collectivist societies people belong to \u2018in groups\u2019 that take care of them in exchange for loyalty."
"Johns\u2019 suggests that- The need for learners to be supported through their learning experience/guided re?ection and that students should maintain and re?ective diary. Sharing re?ections on learning experiences allows for greater understanding of those experiences can be achieved than by re?ection as a lone exercise. (Johns\u2019, 2004) Identification of three key challenges of the family interaction From the interactions with the adolescent and the family, I learnt some of the things that I hadn\u2019t come across and needed to improve on."
"In the psychodynamic tradition the work of child psychoanalyst, John Bowlby (1907-1990), has helped to inform my personal practice; and has facilitated my understanding of how we are motivated by our attachment behavioural systems, and of how we attain our set goals of acquiring protection and security; of how we are activated by perceived threats to our secure base attachment figure. Bowlby\u2019s attachment theory (1958), is therefore instrumental in terms of understanding how children respond to separation and losses; because of how they have experienced the responsiveness of earlier significant attachment figures. Bowlby, (1958), suggests that there is an instinctive psycho-biological element to a commonality shared in both humans and in animals, in that motive, as instinctual reactions can be displayed when attachment bonds are threatened. (Bowlby, J. (1975) Attachment and loss vol 2: Separation: Anxiety and Anger. Harmondsworth: Penquin)."
"The orthodox male-oriented society in India has still not been able to adjust itself to the fresh wave of women\u2019s liberation .But ours is still a male-dominated society. Women still continue to be exploited. There are still places where women are beaten, raped, and murdered without so much as a second thought practices.India is one of these places. A place that is both progressive on paper and in some urban areas but are also far behind in practice and in rural communities."
"A shared goal and collaboration working in a proactive way to prevent violence and the subsequent repercussions is necessary. Problems Faced by Victims \u201cChildren who live with domestic violence face increased risks: the risk of exposure to traumatic events, the risk of neglect, the risk of being directly abused, and the risk of losing one or both of their parents. All of these may lead to negative outcomes for children and may affect their well-being, safety, and stability,\u201d (Carlson, 2000; Edleson, 1999; Rossman, 2001)."
"A student-oriented objective focuses on the learner, not on the teacher. It describes what the learner will be expected to be able to do. It should not describe a teacher activity. It may be helpful to both the teacher and the student to know what the teacher is going to do but teacher activities are also not to be confused with instructional objectives."
"By using our imagination, we have control on our mind, by changing our sorrow into joy for example. We must know then that imagination is not enough; we also need to deal with our challenges, believing that these challenges will gain us strength, wisdom, and knowledge. It is also important to understand that in order to experience happiness, we must therefore, heal our past. \u201cWe have not learned how to roll time backward to undo or change events of the past. However, we can change the ay we feel about past events so that they stop tormenting us in the present, so that they stop spoiling \u2018now\u2019\u201d. In other words, there are still a chance to change everything, we can heal our wounded history and be renewed in order to experience happiness. Healing the past enables someone to be happy in the present. I remember when we are having a retreat at Baguio, I was then a sophomore, and one of the activities during our retreat is be reconciled with ourselves."
"This may include the use of additional resources or equipment specific to the learners needs. Sometimes it may be necessary to seek addition training to aid and enrich the learning opportunities of a child, for example learning makaton, how to use braille or PECS (picture exchange communication system) which can be useful to communicate with children who have a wide range of communication differences including autism. Sometimes additional support may be all a child requires, or simply the time to learn and complete tasks at their own pace."
"We even had African American neighbors also, and this lady was nice to them. One time she even lit a match and threw it in a pile of mulch that was five feet from our front door. These types of things happen to everyone, and everywhere. The one that gets me the most, from the article, was \u201cI can worry about racism without being seen as self-interested or self-seeking. \u201d (McIntosh) This statement is so untrue for white people. Anytime we talk about anything that has to do with embracing our white culture, we are setting back other races."
"They are responsible for the accurate flow medical information and patient data between doctors, patients, and third party payers. The majority of employers expect their staff to work a standard 40 hr. (full-time) work week.They also have part-time and work-from-home options available. The environment you work in depends on where you work at. It\u2019s usually a normal office job environment . Most hospitals stick to \u201ccasual office attire\u201d, some places wear scrubs. Medical Billing and Coding salary ranges from $22,693 (10.91 hr) at entry-level. A higher-end salary is $57,325 and up (27.56 hr and up). It can be salary or hourly depending on the place you work at. Benefits, retirement plans and vacation time vary depending on the company you work for."
"More importantly, his struggles during his early life has also taught me to be more thankful for the current things I have in my life and to not look for things that I don\u2019t have. The story of my father\u2019s life made me feel blessed and at the same time motivated to emulate his diligence, perseverance, and work ethic. However, among all the lessons I have learned from him, the most important lesson he has taught me is to be selfless at all times. In everything my father does, whether it\u2019s studying or working, he always does it for the sake of his family."
"As stated in the Fair Federation for American Immigration Reform, \u201cSanctuary policies are laws, ordinances, resolutions, executive actions, or any initiatives that prohibit local officials from inquiring, acting on, or reporting an individuals immigrations status.\u201d (Sanctuary Policy is Bad Public Policy, 2016). There are many forms in which sanctuary cities destroy communities, but there are three that hold the most weight of all; Illegal immigrants of sanctuary cities inflict pain on innocent people, steal from communities, and sets up a preset to break the law."
"Several tests can be used to diagnose the infection. However, test results usually take two to three days to come back, so in the meantime, the doctor will prescribe antibiotics for the newborn baby while they are waiting for the test results to confirm the diagnosis. For example, rapid breathing could be caused by infection, and any delay in treatment could result in the newborn baby becoming much more ill."
"\u2018The Wife of Bath Prologue\u2019 and \u2018The Wife of Bath Tale\u2019 are based on different themes and topical questions. The Prologue discusses marriage and the relations between men and women, virginity, sexual relations, human experience, etc. The wife says: \u201cThe dart is set up for birginitee (line 75). In contrast, the Tale describes hardship and grievances caused by low status of women in the society and inequality with men. In both pieces, the Wife of Bath describes her strong emotional experience atypical for women of her historical period."
"Curley\u2019s wife, the attention seeker always flirts with other prople on the ranch because her husband is always at the cathouse or out and about. And is never at home to care about her. Curley\u2019s wife is one of the most powerful people in the hireachy because she is married to the boses son. She tries to have some comfort with other people. This is because her husband takes no notice of her apart from the sex. She is used for an object of sex."
"In general, it was a very helpful and educational project for all students. This task taught us how to be more responsible and how to improve our communication skills. Also, it built up our feelings of sympathy towards community categories with special care needs. At the same time, it was a very enjoyable experience. I look forward to implementing what I have learned throughout my life."
"Building means construction. Building also plays important role in culture identity. Different cultures have different type of buildings. Some cultures have big houses while some have small. There are also some cultural people who don\u2019t construct houses also, all life they pass in different places. Usually the cultural people from rural areas have big houses while those living in the city have small houses. The reason may be in rural areas the population is so much low and the place available for the house is very cheap as compare to the city. May be of this reason this culture is raised in the rural areas."
"Ignorance (The condition of being uneducated, unaware or uniformed)- What continues racism is ignorance in the world. If a person grows up doing something their whole lives and everyone else around them does the same thing, it is seen to be right even if it is morally wrong it may be to another human being that does not share the same outlook on life. A group of people will not see anything wrong with their actions because they see their actions as correct. The only way to stop this ignorance is through education and awareness of their actions and what the consequences may be. Until a person\u2019s ignorance is educated, it will continue to thrive racism."
"My charitable events such as raising funds for Macmillan and the Little Princess trust alongside with voluntarywork with younger children through scouts, allows me to bring my enthusiastic characteristics to any setting. I recently helped raise ?1200 for the Rotary club in Chorleywood to help local charities support the community. Being an active person I compete in many Hiking and sailing competitions, such as Peak Assault, in which last year being a group leader of an all-girl winning team was very incomprehensible and unheard of, the paramount of Women and their place in society has vastly improved over the years and such events like peak assault allows Young women to explore their potential in society."
"The authors argue that recent research has modified the way the general population used to think and how now, if given the option, many would support the alternative punishment of life without parole over the death penalty. While supporters of the death penalty thought that the death penalty could be applied without racial and class disparities, research conducted through the years have indicated that race and class disparities have shown not in isolated cases, but in many cases."
"When Lennie enters Crooks cabin in order retrieve the puppies, Crooks lashes out and tells Lennie \u201cI ain\u2019t wanted in the bunk room and you ain\u2019t wanted in my room\u201d (Steinbeck,124). This comment shows that Crooks has become bitter and alone because of the prejudice constantly being aimed at him when there is no reason for the way he is treated. He is a great overall example of racial\u00a0prejudice in Of Mice and Men and society, both past and present, in which a African-American male, who is as capable as any man of another color is denied the same opportunities because of stereotypes and perceptions which can only be supported with biased false facts."
"The statement allows the diverse workforce by utilizing the vision statement by including the company\u2019s belief (Credo). The credo, Latin for \u201cI believe\u201d,\u00a0guides the company to the responsibilities as they relate to customers, employees, community and shareholders. The responsibilities are as follows:To our customers: we will embrace diversity in order to respect, understand and meet their varying health care needs."
"In order to be considered a gem, the mineral should have a Mohs\u2019 hardness of 6 or more, and 7 to be considered a comparatively durable gem. The significance of a gemstone depends on its beauty, rarity, and size. These factors are directly proportionate to the value. The size is measured in carats, where a carat is 0.2 grams. A single carat is further subdivided into points, specifically 100 points making one carat.There are three categories gems, depending on their origin; whether they are mined, synthetically made, or obtained from organic materials. A synthetic gem is one made in a laboratory but possesses the same chemical, physical, and optical characteristics as the natural equivalent, unless additional components are added on purpose to increase aesthetics or durability."
"In child marriage, not only does a girl lose her education but she also experiences an emotional adversity health problem during early age Pregnancy. Pregnancy is one of the early marriage problems in my country. To be a mother is a big responsibility that a mother should give priority for her child, but how can the young woman manage this big responsibility as she is too young to be a mother, so to take care of a child it needs a lot of patient and sacrifices. The risk of pregnancy among young women becomes higher. Some young women who get pregnant early may experience stress and worry much about the pregnancy that happened for her and also face depression. Some of the causes of early pregnancy among young age are lack of education especially sexual education, Lack of education among young age should be given priority. In my opinion, sexual education should be learned in school because most of the time the husbands are often considerably older and have more sexual experience so that education can be one of the most powerful tools to enable girls to avoid child marriage and fulfill their potential. The longer a girl stays in school, the less likely she is to be married before the age of 18 and have children during her teenage years."
"Her meaning behind this parenting style is that parents should worry less on every grade or scores that are received. Try not to perfect their child academic skills. Put more of that concern and interests into providing a principle for success and preparing their children to be ready for the world, and reality where ever they go. Starting kids at a young age on chores to set them up to know what the true meaning of hard work is. By giving love to your child, to let them know you matter and care about them. Those students going into college do not need to worry about getting into a major brand name college just to be happy and successful. That doesn\u2019t matter on what college you go to or flunk out, it isn\u2019t the end of the world as long as you are successful in your own life. Children without going according to parents checklist, will experience the true meaning of life and find their own desires. The right parenting style is a parent needs to provide love, support, strengthen and nurture to their children."
"Garcia (1996) also creates a link with other dominant definitions of racism; attached importance on superiority and interracial antagonism. The two elements are integral components in various manifestations of racism. True racists therefore thrive on interracial antagonism which justifies belief in superiority. However, it should be noted that belief in superiority is not always a necessary component for racism; in fact, in most cases it cannot be treated as a psychological necessity."
"Domestic abuse is something that has been happening for years in the life of women. But now this is something that is not just happening to women. It is happening to elders, men, same sex relationships and in teen relationships. Domestic abuse is also often applied to those that are considered poor or living in lower socioeconomic classes, but that is not true because domestic abuse does not discriminate it affects all walks of life rather rich or poor. Victims and abusers involved in domestic violence come from all socioeconomic classes and racial groups according to Birzer and Etter (2007) (pg."
"Our scriptures are the storehouses of spiritual wisdom. The Indians are rooted to spiritual values in spite of the material progress. The West is fast inclining towards our spiritual values which include meditation, charity, love, universal brotherhood, fear of God, control of passions, etc. During the British rule in India, the people from all sections and communities stood for a common cause which resulted in the revolt of 1857. It was the first time in Indian history that people from all walks of life, irrespective of their caste, religion and region stood together against a common enemy."
"Analyzing the problem of illegal immigration through the prism of historical context we can found rather interesting information. It is a well-known fact that the migration of Mexicans in the United States has its origins in the late XIX century, when the development of agriculture, mining, light industry, construction of railways in the south of the U.S. required an additional influx of cheap labor from other countries. In the period between 1850-1880 something about 55,000 Mexicans immigrated in the U.S. with the purpose to find a good job there."
"The related topic between the four articles listed below is abortion. There will always be an argument for abortion and against abortions. As a women, I can relate to both sides; pro-choice and pro-life. The fact that the government is trying to take away the choice for an abortions, raises a lot of questions to me. Why shouldn\u2019t women have a choice? Krause, K. W. (2011, July-August). Abortion\u2019s still unanswered questions."
"According to MacMillan web dictionary, there are two definition of interaction; it is the activity of being with and talking to other people and the way of people react to each other, secondly, it is the process by which different thing affect each other. So, based on the definition, we can say that interactional means the way on how people connect and interact to each other. Nakamura (2012) imply that ethnicity is not something that fixed because it\u2019s situationally defined. Ethnic groups are created through particular interactional, historical, economical and political circumstances."
"On admission, she was examined conscious, coherent, with vital signs within the normal range. On physical examination, her breasts were staged as Tanner Stage 2. Focusing on the pelvic area, there was a large erythematous vulvar mass approximately 30x15cm, extending from the vulvar area up to the right inguinal area. It was warm and tender on palpation, and was noted to be tense at the lower borders. A 0.5cm movable contender lymph node was appreciated on the left inguinal area."
"However, the phenomenon of custodial crimes is still continuous in police custody. According to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), the majority of the complaints, received by the NHRC pertain to Uttar Pradesh State over the years. In its latest report (2005-06) the Commission commented that trend is continues despite the fact that the State of Uttar Pradesh has its own state human rights commission. Human rights NGOs in India have played significant role through public interest litigation and other initiatives in promotion and protection of human rights including securing custodial justice in police custody."
"A conclusion about solitude can be drawn from the passages, that is, that people become \u201cmean\u201d or unhappy when they are alone, and this is relevant to this novel as George and Lennie are the only ones in the novel, apart from Candy and his dog, with a companion and this means that they are different from others and they have dreams and hope. This is shown in the introduction to death, that of Candy\u2019s dog, where we see that George, Candy and Lennie, with each other, can plan setting up their own ranch (page fifty nine/page sixty one). As they have each other, we can also see that they know each other better than most people do, particularly in George and Lennie\u2019s case. We see during the suspense filled moments before the killing the young ranch hand Whit, who talks about a man he used to work with called Bill Tenner: \u201cLittle guy\u2026drove a cultivator\u201d and this was the only detail about Bill they remembered, and they only knew him well enough to call him a \u201cnice fella\u201d and we can see this being repeated several times in the passage which introduces the ranch hands as well, with Candy referring to both the Boss and Crooks as a \u201cnice fella\u201d."
"The purpose of the death penalty is to rid the world of evil doers, but in reality it just seems like the easy way, life in prison would be so much more agonizing for the criminal. Nonetheless we are now broadcasting these executions, giving the criminal exposure that he/she isn\u2019t worthy of receiving. Mary Meehan a journalist from the National Catholic Review declared that \u201cExecutions have a corrupting effect on the public,\u201d (National Catholic Review) which is true because nowadays we can literally see the offenders last living moments and who\u2019s to say some innocent adolescent child isn\u2019t watching this, and being tainted as well, which will just continue the cycle of this death penalty. The authority believe that this performance of death will act as a model for all other offenders out there, but in all truth it does nothing, crime rates are higher now than they have ever been and they continue to grow. With that being said putting an end to the death penalty has never been more required. We essentially should"
"In India, no reliable or authentic statistics is available regarding the custodial crimes in police custody. Most of the incidents of torture are not recorded. Incidents of torture and injury in urban areas are brought to public notice by the media, while large number of such incidents occurring in rural areas of our vast country, remain unnoticed. In this state of affairs, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact number of incidents of torture and death in custody (Law Commission of India 1994)."
"The conservative male can be recognized within the host, he is more sensitive and open to feelings; however he is domestic and can still be presented as powerful. The last male we see within Hanks roles is the conservative male, this character type does not make a regular appearance within the show and could be seen to be someone within the audience this person is seen as weak and is often applied to homosexuality."
"I believe that this is where the insanity and sickness of Barabbas reaches a peak. He is determined to kill his own daughter, because he feels that she disrespects her family\u2019s name. The epilogue to this madness comes when finally Barabbas gets killed by his own evil plots. In the end of the story we can easily identify the negative characteristics that Barabbas has, which are also strongly connected to the fact that he is Jewish. His elitist nature, his illogical actions that are all driven by his avarice, and his lack of sentiments towards other people, make him fit ideally the stereotypes of Jews that existed at the time. So, every single part of his hateful and insane being, is justified by the fact that he is Jewish, and thus it is natural that he is unstable and inferior to Christians. The next example of anti-Semitic portrayals comes from \u2018The Merchant of Venice\u2019. The main character, Shylock is portrayed as a greedy Jewish moneylender that is just like Barabbas, when it comes to hate towards Christians and other people in general. He is also a heartless man, not feeling pity for anyone, showing a rather sadistic nature."

"Given that one of Brazil\u2019s major exports is still coffee, it is no surprise that coffee is the most popular beverage, called Cafezinho. The huge range of tropical fruits also results in a large range of fruit juices being available at roadside juice bars. Brazil also has a wine industry mainly in the south where the climate is better suited to growing grapes, although there is some wine production in the west."
"It states \u201cExpressed in the simplest terms the ideas (of noble friendships) are friendship is based on virtue, friendship based on equality, friendship based on similarity\u2026 and friends goods are common goods\u201d this applies to both The \u201cMerchant\u201d and The \u201cRunning Man\u201d. This was openly expressed in \u201cThe Merchant of Venice\u201d By William Shakespeare through the two characters of Antonio and Bassanio."
"From these absurd, oftentimes ridiculous, and obviously arrogant words, the reader can conclude that the Duke was a controlling husband. Lines 50 onwards tell the reader that the Duke is looking for a new wife and the person whom he is showing the painting to, is the assistant or messenger of a Count whose daughter the Duke is eyeing as a prospective wife. The talk he would have later with the Count would be about the arrangement of his next marriage (My Last Duchess Discussion)."
"If a parent has a child with albinism, it means the parent must carry the albinism gene. Until recently, unless a person has albinism or has a child with albinism, there was no way of knowing whether he or she carries the gene for albinism. Recently a test has been developed to identify carriers of the gene for ty-negative albinism and for other types in which the tyrosinase enzyme does not function. The test uses a sample of blood to identify the gene for the tryrosinase enzyme by its DNA code. A similar test can identify ty- negative or similar albinism in unborn babies, by aminiocentesis. People with albinism have very normal lives. They play sports, have normal intelligence, and can have babies. The only difference between normal people and albino is that they don\u2019t have pigment in their skin."
"The disadvantages of this model include the fact that it was based on the study of rents and housing rather than on land as a whole. Secondly, there is variation within a sector. For example, in the medium class residential zone, the housing will include council flats as well as semi-detached housing."
"There has long been discrimination against what is considered the lowest class in Hinduism , as well as sectarian and religious violence. Although it has been outlawed by the Indian Constitution , the richer people still racist the lowest class people in the country . The racism problem is more serious in urban areas than rural areas . The most racism problem is where most Indians live . For an example , there are a lot of richer businessmen in India and they looked down to the aborigines who are poor . People who are poor in India regard as lowest class ."
"Professor Thomson presents an account that would be reasonable if the act of abortion was purely an attempt of separation. But in fact the procedure used is an attempt, not only to detach and remove the foetus, but to kill it.[22] If the abortionist fails in this task, then Thomson allows the baby a right to live. But as the method of termination is designed for the foetus to die, I believe it renders Thomson\u2019s point unsound."
"Immigration laws affect U.S. citizen children through multigenerational punishment. The author, Laura E. Enriquez, examined the complex relationship U.S. citizen children of undocumented 1.5-generational young adults have with immigration laws. In the article \u201cMultigenerational Punishment: Shared Experiences of Undocumented Immigration Status Within Mixed-Status Families\u201d Enriquez (2015) states that U.S. citizen children of 1.5-generational parents\u2019 experience multigenerational violence. Enriquez argues that immigration laws create multigenerational punishment because the legal ramifications intended for undocumented immigrants affect the lives of U.S. citizens. For the study, Enriquez interviewed undocumented 1.5-generational young adults who had U.S. citizen children. The term 1.5-generation refers to a person who immigrated to a new country as a preteen or during their early teenage years. Enriquez conducted 32 interviews with undocumented 1.5-generational young adults. 21 of the interviewees were mothers, 8 were fathers, one couple were expecting a child and one woman who had been pregnant and decided not to have the baby. All the interviewees\u2019 children were U.S. citizens between infancy and 15. Enriquez supports her claim by examining the effect immigration laws have on undocumented 1.5-generational young adults and their U.S. citizen through deportation fears, driving, travel and legal employment. Many of the parents interviewed said that they had discussed deportation with their children. This exchange leads to multigenerational violence because their children then feared being deported. Most interviewee\u2019s feared being pulled over without a license, so they used risk management strategies to prevent getting pulled over. Many of their U.S. citizen children became hyper-vigilant when in the car with their parents; and adopted their parent\u2019s risk management strategies."
"Among them, People\u2019s Union for Civil Liberty (PUCL), People\u2019s Union for Democratic Rights (PUDR), South Asian Human Rights Documentation Centre (SAHRDC), Asian Centre for Human Rights (ACHR), Penal Reform and Justice Administration (PRAJA), Commonwealth Human Rights Initiatives (CHRI), People\u2019s Watch, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are worth mentioning. These organizations have dome commendable work through fact findings, lobbying, advocacy, research and documentation of custodial crimes and highlighted torture cases before the Courts & Human Rights Commissions with great administrative hurdles (Desai 1986)."
"Hesiod\u2019s follows the Homers description: he makes the Chimera the issue of Echidna: \u201cShe was the mother of Chimaera who breathed raging fire, a creature fearful, great, swift-footed and strong, who had three heads, one of a grim-eyed lion; in her hinderpart, a dragon; and in her middle, a goat, breathing forth a fearful blast of blazing fire While there are different genealogies, in one version the Chimera mated with her brother Orthrus and mothered the Sphinx and the Nemean Lion."
"During my visits to the setting I have observed that all the main entrance doors are operated by buzzer system. To gain access to the building visitors must ring the buzzer and identify themselves and the purpose of their visit to office secretary before being allowed to enter the setting. Every member of staff has a key fob to allow them entry into the building. Visitors must report straight to reception and sign in. They are then given a visitor badge to identify them to others. This badge is returned to the office when they are leaving and signing out. This ensures that all pupils and staffs right to safety and security is maintained. It is also reassuring for parents as they know intruders or unsuitable members of the public cannot access keeping their children safe at all times. CCTV was also in operation."
"The perpetual campaigning for his innocence and detailed media coverage over many years would have ensured Medak that he would receive a great public response from his representation of events. \u2018Let Him Have It\u2019 shows how Derek Bentley, a shy introverted character, becomes involved with a group of youths who lure him into a life of petty crime. Derek\u2019s concerns over the activities of the gang are soon dismissed when he realises, Chris Craig, the arrogant and egotistical leader, is essentially his only friend."
"The same psychological game is played with Mrs. Wright by Mr. Wright in \u201cTrifles\u201d. Mr. Wright even kills the canary, which might be the only thing that Mrs. Wright is attached to since her freedom is taken away as we find out by the women in the play, that she isn\u2019t allowed to go out. Subjugation by these men trigger mental stress on both women which leads to tragedy."
"The urban layout of buildings of various different sizes vastly affects the wind pattern in the upper atmosphere; there are effects on wind speed, direction and frequency. Tall buildings can greatly interfere with airflow \u2013 they disturb the lower layers of the atmosphere, exerting a frictional drag and slowing the overall speed of the wind over an urban area."
"George kept the dream alive for Lennies sake many times during the novel, and at one point we had the faith that it would work out. Yet it was inevitable that the dream was never going to work out. Seeing that many individuals in \u2018Of Mice and Men\u2019 were pessimistic about the dream ever succeeding. George often told Lennie of the dream, but never actually believed in the dream himself."
"As the rest of the train ride is told in Nel\u2019s perspective, readers get to see the effect of the experience on Nel and how she perceives her mother. This shows how a mother truly does have effect on her daughter, but also how influenced African-Americans are by the racial factors in society. By Helene attempting to live above the standards in the Bottom, she is discriminated against by whites and her own community. Her discriminatory life affects the communication between her and Nel, showing that by Helene and her mother having a lack of communication affects the relationship between Nel and Helene and how much they share with one another. The trip affected Nel in that she changed. By the conductor humiliating her, she felt an emotional distance between her mother and grandmother. She begins her new way of life by stating, \u201cI\u2019m me. I\u2019m not their daughter. I\u2019m not Nel. I\u2019m me\u201d. She has come to realize and see how her mother has failed in life by manipulating her family, not adapting well to society, and not having a decent relationship with her own mother, therefore affecting her relationship with her own daughter Nel."
"The rest of our family, however, felt the full impact of Hitler\u2019s anti-Jewish laws, so life was filled with anxiety. In 1938 after the pogroms, my two uncles (my mother\u2019s brothers) escaped to the U.S.A. My old grandmother came to us, she was then seventy-three. After May 1940 good times rapidly fled: first the war, then the capitulation, followed by the arrival of the Germans, which is when the sufferings of us Jews really began. Anti-Jewish decrees followed each other in quick succession. Jews must wear a yellow star, Jews must hand in their bicycles, Jews are banned from trains and are forbidden to drive."
"She was also known as Nanyehi among the Cherokee tribe. She was a very courageous woman, much like Margaret Corbin. Nancy fought right beside her husband in combat. When he died in battle, she continued to fight and brought the Cherokee tribe to victory, earning herself the title of \u201cBeloved Woman\u201d. She continued to work toward getting a leadership role in her tribe, and ended up sitting on General Council, as well as leading the Women\u2019s Council. Nancy played an important role in keeping the peace between her people with her advice on non-violent behavior."
"Those who oppose this position might argue that the government has a compelling interest in what a woman decides to do with her body. To them I say: interesting, but not persuasive. Maybe some of you are qualified to make this uncensored calculation, so I\u2019ll pose the question to you. Who has the greater interest, the woman who knows her body or a group of bureaucrats who don\u2019t the price of a gallon of milk? Women should be free from government intrusion that pertains to their body because they are singular best situated to choose a course, they should live their values not legislate them, and last it\u2019s the foundation of liberty."
"The right to own a gun is secured by the 2nd constitutional amendment. So, prohibition of guns from being owned or bought is immoral and unconstitutional. Gun control in the United States should be eliminated. To get a gun, one would have to go through an exam to get a license to own and use a gun, and you wouldn\u2019t be able to get one if you have any criminal record and you would also need to be a responsible adult."
"Connie seemed to lament the way her mother would treat her and her older sister June to the point that she \u201cwished her mother was dead and she herself was dead and it was all over. \u201d She lamented to her friends, \u201cShe makes me want to be thrown up some times. \u201d Connie at fifteen still has childish behavior perhaps typical for young woman like her, showing little concern with house works as her mind was all filled with trashy day dreams."
"The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Addis Continental Institute of Public Health Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Necessary support letters were received from all the sub-cities and woreda level health offices. Study objectives were explained to participants and their informed consent was obtained prior to the data collection. During the MUAC measurement; those children who were severely malnourished (MUAC 10%), odds ratios do not approximate risk ratio(48)."

"All of us are living on the Earth that is a habitat for humanity, and we were not placed here by chance. If we are living together, we have the responsibility for each other. We should help anyone who is in need and be sympathetic to others. They are also very motivated because as follows by the quote said by Mr. Goh \u201cInstead of giving them fish, we teach how to fish\u201d. They have never asked anything from anyone and worked for everything to the best extend within their capabilities."
"At this stage the audience gather that Linda is very concerned for Willy. Linda never manages to attain her dream since Willy would be more willingly to commit suicide than to surrender his job as a salesman. In addition to this, Linda yearns to safeguard Willy. A case of this is whilst speaking to Ben\u00a0she shouts at Ben and says, \u2018don\u2019t say those things to him! \u2018Afterwards, it is clear that she is shielding him; even though the stage directions interpret Linda as being \u2018frightened of Ben\u2019, she becomes assertive for Willy\u2019s benefit. She fails to shade Willy as he objects, resulting in the worst case scenario whilst under her belt."
"Dhingra points out that although it was antecedently thought that organizing webs of co-ethnics or shared individuality as portion of a diaspora would signal certain separation and deficiency of assimilation ( Gordon cited in Dhingra ) , she notes that there has been a batch of research demoing that 2nd coevals immigrants are really utilizing their cultural individualities to go more American and to incorporate."
"Child marriages have negative and unexpected consequences like propagation of disease, divorce cases and escaping from home. While parent\u2019s poverty and illiteracy may lead to their marrying daughters as child, these very marriages will prevent the daughters from having access to education and economic progress. Research Questions: 1. What are the Social, Economic and Political consequences of forced and early marriages in rural society? Objective The focus of this concept paper is to know reasons, causes and consequences of early childhood marriages in Afghanistan."
"A symbol that Steinbeck uses to express this is the card game solitaire. Solitare meaning \u201cto be alone\u201d. Even though he has Lennie, he chooses to play alone because if he played with Lennie they wouldn\u2019t be able to get anywhere. This reflects not only on the card game but also his life as well. Because he has to constantly take care of Lennie, he remains stuck in the progress of his own life. This can be seen when George becomes enraged at Lennie for wanting ketchup and begins to rant about how easy life would be without him."
"Some might argue that blacks and whites are equal, but it is obvious through these essays that this is not so. If being stereotyped by some white people is not enough, many middle class blacks are ridiculed by many lower class blacks. It seems that some financially unstable African Americans consider middle and upper class African Americans to be ignorant of black culture. Discussing this issue, McClain says that some lower class blacks think, \u201cWe have forsaken the revolution, we are told, we have sold out.\u201d Being treated in such a way must surely aggravate or maybe depress an African American who has worked tirelessly for their status. Steele says that many think, \u201c\u2026that the purest black was the poorest black.\u201d Perhaps some lower class blacks have been taught, all their lives, that African Americans were supposed to be on the bottom of the financial scale, and now when they see their colleagues cracking that barrier, they become jealous and stoop to ridicule. Financial matters should not take precedence over culture. Just because one person is richer than another does not mean that the latter is any less culturally diverse. Everyone needs to stand together, be it white and black, black and black, or white and white."
"Religion can also be viewed as a cultural phenomenon, characteristic of various human societies with their system of values and fundamental myths. Some religions, such as Christianity or Islam, affirm their universality, and insist on their own exceptionalism and its special position in the world. Nevertheless, even Christianity and Islam can be seen as a product of historical development under certain conditions."
"Mrs Allonby sees marriages and relationships in terms of ownership, with men \u2018always trying to escape from us\u2019; Lady Caroline sees marriage as a tool to control men and to keep them \u2018in their proper place\u2019 and Lady Stutfield uses dependency in order to flirt \u2018Men are so very, very heartless\u2019, and Hester keeps out of this part of the conversation- perhaps emphasising her naivety in the world of men and women whilst Lady Hunstanton just seems to back up Mrs Allonby and Lady Caroline\u2019s ideas."
"The issue escalates further when Skylar tries to comfort Will about his tragic past, which infuriates Will even further. After their break-up Will searches for the\u00a0meaning of life with help from his best friend\u2019s who purchase him a car to help him commute to a new job which would enable him to break from his \u201ctough city guy\u201d image. Between the time of breakup, job interviews, and guidance from Chuck Will discovers his potential and strives to successfully use his talent through the identity status of diffusion. Finally Will reaches the achievement identity status as he leaves Boston to reunite with Skylar in California, which proves to be the greatest decision of his life."
"It will serve as a tool in promoting a more secure environment. Even the staff is assigned to l00 patients; he/she will be able to enjoy a hassle free recording because of the automatic commands in computer that will speed up the process unlike the manual recording. The EMR will help decrease errors in medical recording. The medical attendants to patients\u2019 time will be also increase because there is no longer need for checking on the time consuming paper records and correcting on the misreported patients information and diagnoses."
"I don\u2019t think abortion is actually killing. I believe that life begins when the child is capable of survival independently. Sometimes this is 40 weeks, more or less. If the foetus can\u2019t survive outside the womb then it cannot be alive. With great care some premature babies as young as 24 weeks have survived, but many have suffered huge health problems leading to blindness and mental handicaps. I don\u2019t believe this is fair on the child."
"In the essay of Shange, she told the story of numerous local delicacies that will convince us to the point that we are establishing. Take for example the Shange\u2019s example of sweet potatoes. In the essay, she made a very good way of instructing his readers on how to grow quality sweet potatoes."
"In a democratic society this is unlikely to happen, which would help readers who enjoy more individual freedom to fully comprehend how helpless these people were and the inhumane act they were put through. The line following describes how they mistreated Danaladi with the use of the word \u2018dragged\u2019. Osundare\u2019s clever use of verbs makes Danladi\u2019s arrest sound excruciating and ruthless. Towards the end of the second stanza the poet recollects how \u2018they\u2019 seized Danladi and took him away \u2018to a lengthy absence\u2019. The use of euphemism creates a feeling of uncertainty."
"This is shown in the poem with \u201cmy maid and I crept out\u201d which illustrates a sense of the two women trying to amuse themselves. This relates strongly to the idea of men whose wives stray are part to blame as men often become so preoccupied with other matters that their wives happiness is pushed into the background, and therefore when their wife hurts them, they deserve no sympathy this is also expressed with the emphatic pun \u201cPontius\u201d, which illustrates Pilate\u2019s wife sense of disgust towards her husband."
"It was around 2010 when my father mentioned that his older sister, who lives in Canada, was going to sponsorship us. In the next couple of years, we got accepted to immigrate to Canada and I still remember my parents were excited about it. I didn\u2019t know much about Canada, about how living there will be, and how it might change us and our living."
"Walt Disney once said \u201cIf you dream it, you can do it\u201d but for many migrant workers in the nineteen forties, their dreams were hard to achieve. In the book Of Mice and Men, two migrant workers who travel together get into trouble when Lennie, who happens to be mentally disabled grabs women dress, not knowing any better. Lennie and George had a dream to have their own farm, which gave them the inspiration to work. Candy, an old disabled worker at the ranch, had no dream untill he was inspired by Lennie and George to have their own farm, he wanted to join in on it."
"During the pivotal scene on the BART platform, Coogler shows us a widely chaotic setting of suspects who don\u2019t feel they\u2019ve done anything wrong and can\u2019t understand why they\u2019re being detained, police who make things worse with their heavy-handed tactics some claim cross the line into brutality, and onlookers who are filming, shouting and chastising transit police."
"The poems \u2018The Worlds Wife\u2019 reflect Duffy\u2019s own, very feminist, view of the world. Explore this statement using either two or three in detail or ranging more widely across the collection. Carol Ann Duffy was born on December 23rd 1955 in Glasgow and is a very strong feminist, in \u2018The Worlds Wife\u2019 Duffy explores what it is like to be a woman and uses dramatic monologue in many of her poems to convey her thoughts. The speakers of the poems are all female but we also hear the male voice, be it mediated through the female voice."
"Rural population densities in these areas are extremely high, reaching 3,000 per square mile (1,160 per square kilometer) in parts of Java. Densities tend to be much less in the Outer Islands. Only about 22 percent of Indonesia\u2019s population lives in cities, but the country has a number of large urban centers. The urban population growth of the 1960s and 1970s was more than twice as rapid as the total population growth. Indonesia has more than 30 cities with populations of over 100,000, and five with over a million; Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, and Semarang, all on Java; and Medan on Sumatra."
"However, the action was not of malice nor desire no it was a decision made from and entirely of fear. Jefferson a 21-year-old man still very young and yet to discover the many lessons\u2019 life has to offer. Jefferson who grew up with a poverty-stricken life as said here \u201cAin\u2019t never had enough ice cream. Never had more than a nickel cone.\u201d(Gaines 170) One nickel in 1940, would be worth 92 cents today."
"In some research it was found that most people who grew up with a not so good childhood or not as equal or does not have as much stuff or as nice stuff as other people were more likely to get a capital punishment crime and were later killed for a crime they commited. Most people who were either treated wrong or were mentally ill have the hardest time overcoming not commiting crimes this is what should truly be looked at when charging someone of a crime. Some people look at the death penalty as \u201c An eye for an eye\u201d and if everyone goes around having the same mentality or lives the same then what kind of society are we really living in. if everyone lived by the same set standards or the same religion or same sex/gender than technically that makes us all the same and makes all of us a criminal. There could also be a racial difference here, if someone on the jury say does or does not like a person from a different race then you\u2019re definitely going to get an opposite judgement than what is really deserved and could potentially put someone\u2019s life in the hands of someone else causing tremendous pain for not only them but the families and friends of an innocent person."
"Although the 1950\u2019s may have provided a more family friendly economic and social environment, greater optimism existed, even among many individuals and groups who were in terrible circumstances. The post war economic boom gave way to the 1950\u2019s where a majority of Americans could begin to dream of a new life without fear of societies constraints. However, for many this dream was not fully recognized due to negative views on race and class, which ultimately contributed to the hardships that many immigrants and minorities experienced."
"Like Hughes\u2019 poem, Cullen\u2019s poem is also about the battle of racial identity, yet in addition, he uses religion and mythology to further express the speaker\u2019s struggle with racial injustices. Although the theme of racial inequality is common in both poems, Cullen\u2019s poem focuses more on the speaker\u2019s continual reference to religion and the justification of Gods will. Unlike the hope that the speaker explicated in Hughes\u2019 poem, the speaker in Cullen\u2019s poem starts out having faith in God, \u201cI doubt not God is good, well-meaning, kind,\u201d (line 1). However, he later contradicts his faith in God due to the hardships of discrimination that African Americans endured in the last lines of the poem, \u201cYet do I marvel at this curious thing: /To make a poet black, and bid him sing!\u201d (lines 13-14)."
"On the other hand the principled argument in favor of including illegal immigrants in health reform is that decent health coverage is a basic human right. A just nation should support that right for everyone, regardless of why or how a person is in the country. There are also practical reasons to support including undocumented immigrants in health reform. Ethics aside, there is no pragmatic way to deny emergency care to illegal immigrants The impact on morals regarding immigration reform would be how does the issue of immigration reform sits with your mores and values. Should the Christian Values of treating others how you would like to be treated be used? Many Liberals would like to change the laws on immigration to strengthen border security and be fair to taxpayers but also include a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who are in the country illegally."
"John Steinbeck uses foreshadowing through out the story of \u201cOf Mice and Guy\u201d to prepare the reader for the last scene. Foreshadowing is the composition of layered tips or ideas about what might occur in the future of the story. Early in the story, these lines or occasions recommend a wide variety of possibilities to the audience. However as the story advances, the range narrows. In order for the effect of foreshadowing to be efficient, the audience has to be both amazed by the climax of the story and discover it logical."
"The emotional distress of Urmi would have been minimized if she had been associated herself in mother \u2013 in- laws home. Urmi is a woman who wants to live an independent life. Indian society has its own merits of showering care and sharing of burden especially in traditional family structure. Urmi missed the opportunity to access their emotional healing resource in her life which is the main cause of her trauma. J.R. Tripathi opines that \u201cthe mother\u2019s emotional distress is relieved by communal sharing and affections and rises above the European concept of existential emotional distress which is isolationistic and individualistic and hence depressing and deadly\u201d (2)."
"Racism is renowned for lowering the self-esteem of any targeted group or\u00a0person, in this case Aminata pride was hurt due to the matter of other peoples prejudices. Aminata lacks self-confidence, she believes that she was born a slave and always will be a slave when her friend Chekura affirms that, \u201cany nigger in you at all, then you is a slave as clear as day\u201d (134). This makes Aminata feel like she was a slave from day one and that was her sole purpose in life. She does not feel secure about her self-worth and believes that blacks are meant to be treated like slaves. Furthermore, the white owners show their right over Aminata by abusing her physically to dehumanize her. \u201cI screamed as I have never screamed before, I did not recognize myself, I had no clothes, no beauty, no hair, and no womanhood\u201d (178)."
"The last motivating factor in the pursuit of knowledge is self-improvement, which holds the biggest potential of all. Self-improvement includes pursuing goals and aspirations, incentives, growth in oneself, and ultimately, happiness. The desire to know more, grow as individuals and influence change in our internal and external environments is why this is the motivating factor that holds the biggest potential as a driving force to seek out different types of knowledge."
"My conclusion, I have fully recognized without the theorist of early childcare and education making their discoveries known and continuing to strive for the greater good that we would still believe children were miniature adults. We wouldn\u2019t have many doctors or engineers or even artist as we all need guidance and motivation to achieve our goals as teachers, we find the best way to guide our students to think big and encourage them to be tomorrow\u2019s leaders and thinkers."
"Many report suggests that racial discrimination does occur at some points in the criminal justice system. Following the Rodney King incident, the report of the Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department (also called the Christopher Commission) (1991) found that there was excessive use of force by LAPD officers and that this was compounded by racism and bias (Banks 69)."
"We can plant more trees. Trees are extremely important to human life on earth. Trees give us food, produces oxygen and help us to survive. But today people cut down trees to make room for new building, roads and cities. Trees are used to make newspapers, computer paper, furniture, houses and many other products. If we love planting trees instead of destroying it we could contribute in saving the environment. Did you know that planting trees help to make the ground stronger- Many islands of Maldives have weak land \u2013 if we plant more trees, we could save islands from getting completely eroded. Another very important thing we can do to help save our environment is to use less electricity. The simplest thing is to remember to turn the lights off when you leave a room! Even if you\u2019re not using it, leaving something plugged in takes up energy from the Earth! Save Water. Water is life. Without water we cannot survive."
"A quote that the book gives is \u201cKirsty Beal sits on the edge of the bed, leaning over Mrs Beal. \u2018It\u2019s all right, Mum, he\u2019s gone now \u2018. This quote was on page eighteen and it was about how everyone is a victim and it is how they all try to make each other feel better by saying words like \u201cits all right Mum, he\u2019s gone now. In the book \u201cKill the Possum\u201d by James Moloney makes you think about the consequences of your actions before you act."
"I completely disagree with the NRA\u2019s view that doctors should not be involved in advocating gun control. The NRA says that they are doing their best and yet, in Jillian Banner\u2019s article published on Atlantic documentaries \u2018How the NRA sparked a medical rebellion\u2019, we see trauma surgeons predict that one million Americans will be shot in the next decade. This sad prediction is enough to show how poor the NRA\u2019s gun policy is. In America, gun ownership is seen as a culture. People believe that it is their duty to exercise their right to bear arms in accordance to the second amendment. To show how deep a culture this is, North American reporter, Anthony Zurcher writes an article titled \u2018Gun Culture in America\u2019."
"Kids are more entitled than ever today, doing less around the home, being padded from failure, and given awards for just showing up. How children think they somehow deserve a free college education (paid for by mom and dad or the State), to get paid $15/hr. to take someone\u2019s food order, and to have the latest gadgets and toys free of limitations and monitoring. When children don\u2019t get what they think they deserve, they cry it\u2019s unfair, unjust, and plain"

This was developed by researcher professor sir mason Durie in 1984 for Maori philosophy is health and their anticipation of well-being connected with the dimensions of health is physical, mental, social, emotional and spiritual. It is consisting of tinana, whenua, whanau, Wairau and hinengaro. The whare has four partition and separately partition express diverse dimension of healthiness."
"However, many people tend to forget that retirement homes also offer other benefits that are often overlooked by people. Here are some of the most common benefits that retirement homes provide to residents and their loved ones. One of the most overlooked benefits retirement homes provide to residents is a structured environment."
"Being a parent is usually considered as a job, an irreplaceable and genuine job; however, it sometimes requires a great deal of dedication and effort in order to properly raise children and to fulfill their needs. Parenthood, as stated by Umberson, Pudrovska, and Reczek (2010), is a transformative and influential process; therefore, being a parent is not just a mere task that one can accomplish overnight. It is a challenging experience that sometimes can cause enervation and stress. In line with this, according to an article written by Glover (2018), being a parent, especially in the present time is becoming harder than ever for the reason that there are several new challenges that parents may face or are currently facing."
"I personally feel that it should be illegal to kill an unborn child. I believe that having a baby is a gift from God and that if you are sexually irresponsible an abortion should not be an escape from taking responsibility for your actions. In certain scenarios, like impending detriment to the mother, being faced with having a child be born with an abnormality or having to have the child of a man who raped you, I will concede that I understand why there would be a dilemma but I still believe that killing the child is not the answer. If you can\u2019t handle it then give the baby up for adoption but murder is murder regardless. What about those who act carelessly because they know in the back of their minds that they have another alternative if something should go unplanned? For example; there are many teens that become pregnant because of carelessness. If these young girls knew that if they became pregnant, they had no option but to keep the child, would they be more careful? Absolutely! Personally, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with the world today; people have too many ways of getting out of a hard situation and no longer have to take responsibility for their actions."
"Shakespeare portrays Othello and Desdemona\u2019s relationship as secure and loving due to Othello coming across as a strong character. But this could change, due to Othello\u2019s deep rooted insecurities of him being black in a white just society as factors on why he could believe that his wife is being unfaithful. In act one scene three Othello completes the story of his courtship he says \u2018she loved me for the dangers I had passed and, I love d her that she did pity them. This expresses that there love is real and Desdemona loved him for who he was and his past history rather than his social status and financial stability. She looked past his colour. This could infer that there is more to Othello and Desdemona relationship. Shakespeare\u2019s repeated use of \u2018loved\u2019 twice reflects the intense emotion they feel for one another and mirrors a pairing because he indicates that the their love is mutual. Further here Othello is speaking to people of high status with such confidence which proves here his colour doesn\u2019t affect his proud position and he reinforces himself that his relationship with Desdemona at this point is secure."
"S\u2019pose you couldn\u2019t go into the bunk house and play rummy \u2019cause you was black. How\u2019d you like that? S\u2019pose you had to sit out here an\u2019 read books. Sure you could play horseshoes till it got dark, but then you got to read books. Books ain\u2019t no good. A guy needs somebody-to be near him. A guy goes nuts if he ain\u2019t got nobody. Don\u2019t make no difference who the guy is, long\u2019s he\u2019s with you. I tell ya, I tell ya a guy gets too lonely an\u2019 he gets sick.\u201d Here Crooks expresses his loneliness and how he is an outcast to the rest of the workers on the ranch. His\u00a0loneliness is formed from discrimination of his African American skin color."
"RFA focuses on the lifelong relationship and quality parenting- no additional approvals for adoption or guardianship. It considers the ability to meet the needs of vulnerable children. Achieves results for children and families. Families will be better prepared and supported, there will be training, and support for all families more stability and fewer moves. It is all about efficiency to eliminates duplicative processes."
"Every friendship has there ups and downs, you get into fights, you disagree, you don\u2019t talk to\u00a0each there for some time but then somehow you start talking to\u00a0them, you forgive each other and move\u00a0on. The good times you have with them will always be\u00a0there with you in\u00a0memory, we\u00a0learn from our past experience and each new person that comes into our life teaches\u00a0us something, no\u00a0friendship is\u00a0ever perfect but it\u00a0takes an\u00a0effort from bothsides, to\u00a0make it\u00a0a\u00a0good one."
"On January 19, 2000, Lazaro Gonzalez, instituted this action as next friend, or alternatively as interim temporary legal custodian, of Elian Gonzalez, a six-year-old child, against the Attorney General, the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d), and other federal defendants. The complaint challenged the INS\u2019s refusal to accept and adjudicate two asylum applications that Lazaro submitted with respect to Elian and an essentially identical application that bore Elian\u2019s signature. On January 27, 2000, the government filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. The district court heard oral argument on the government\u2019s motion on March 9, 2000. On March 21, 2000, the district court granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss or for summary judgment and dismissed the case. Plaintiff appealed. On April 19, 2000, this Court issued an injunction pending appeal, barring Elian\u2019s removal from the United States during the pendency of this appeal"
"However, Kipling is strongly criticized for his concept by many anti-imperialist writers who held opposing ideologies mainly Edward Said. He sees that the notion of The White Man\u2019s Burden, just like Orientalism, has one goal to justify the supremacy of the Western colonizer over the colonized people through depicting stereotypical images of them known as a discourse. This discourse relegates the non-white people to a lower position in the hierarchical divisions of the races which by virtue of their ontological inferiority, Kipling asserts, should be ruled and subjugated."
"Culture shows that the how people behave in different regions, countries and societies. If we look in depth, it seems that the culture appears from a difficult contact among different basics like family, race, gender, nation, religion and heritage. Every person in this world has different likings, taste, language, slang\u2019s and environment; therefore everyone is bound to behave differently Gibson (2002). I shall explain my own"
"As children approach puberty, adults need to talk with them honestly about hormones, emotions and sexual feelings. Schools need to develop honest and matter-of-fact courses on human relationships that include sexuality topics. Such courses can become a vehicle for helping to decrease the rate of adolescent unwanted pregnancies. In these classes, respect for each person\u2019s private parts and personal decisions would be emphasized along with specific information about sexuality and pregnancy. Yet many adolescents are far from being able to engage in formal reasoning about their sexual lives and urges or their social interactions. They spend hours on tweets sending frequent text messages. Teens males struggle to adjust to the sexual changes in their bodies as the voice deepens, hair grows near the genitals and sexual fantasies and interest in sexual ventures pervade thoughts daily. They can show off and take risks, both physical and sexual, that lead to distressing, dangerous, even fatal, consequences. And yet teens still believe that they are invulnerable. They drink and then drive fast without believing that they would ever be killed in a car crash. Teens assume that sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies are something that happens to others but not to them. They feel invincible and invulnerable."
"From 1989 \u2013 1993, George H. W. Bush lead the country. During his presidency, the United States took part in the Gulf War. \u201cWhen Saddam Hussein invaded his small, oil-rich neighbor in the summer of 1990, the Department faced its first full-scale post-Cold War international crisis. Bush\u2019s foreign policy team forged an unprecedented international coalition consisting of the NATO allies and the Middle Eastern countries of Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Egypt to oppose Iraqi aggression\u201d (The First Gulf War). The Gulf War lasted about a year and concluded when Iraq left Kuwait on Feb. 28th 1991. The 1990\u2019s also saw the end of the Cold War, also in 1991. Another Major event in the 1990\u2019s was Hurricane Andrew. Hurricane Andrew was a category 5 hurricane that struck Florida. According to the Medical Examiner Reports of Deaths Associated with Hurricane Andrew, there were 32 deaths that were directly associated with Hurricane Andrew."
"Camera angle was really amazing as two mirrors were shown at the same time. Wherever she goes camera moves with her, as she was dancing and spinning camera movement was according to her movement. At the beginning of the movie,the scene opens as her dancing on her toes,close up shot of that was taken which showed her determination and dedication towards dance. Dance was basically her life."
"This is considerable since it shows the time in which racial inequality was prominent. Both poets were having problem with their feelings of being African American minorities in a society of White superiority. Their poems reflect the oppression of racism, which is especially revealed in Langston Hughes\u2019 poem \u201cI, Too\u201d."
"Within the first season, Ross gets a divorce from his wife, Carol, because he discovers that she is a lesbian. Carol\u2019s lover is named Susan, the woman she ends up with once her and Ross officially split. Although any form of homosexuality is a rare sight for a television show in the 90s, that does not mean that this relationship was depicted well. The sole purpose of their relationship is to make Ross uncomfortable and to trump his fragile masculinity."
"Then, he said \u201cI am a field Negro\u201d (X, Malcolm 1) to show where he stood on the issue. He was a confident public speaker, gesturing like a true professional, like a brilliant pastor behind his pulpit. He knew his audience and made sure that he delivered the message that they wanted to hear and did it with aplomb as he underscored every sound bite that appealed to them. He was Master X behind the rostrum. His message reverberated across America with the same force and appeal that catapulted Martin Luther King Jr. into American consciousness. However, his message had none of the diplomacy and statesmanship presented by King."
"This source tells us that \u2018although the government has greater responsibilities, it has no greater power,\u2019 counteracting the view of Roosevelt\u2019s opposition and turning it round to say that the government just had to work a lot harder for the population. The source tells us that the power was, \u2018still in the hands of the people,\u2019 as they had the power to give the government the power. It concludes with the statement, \u2018the charge that Roosevelt has been a dictator is not true. \u2018 This source in my view has a very positive judgement of Roosevelt and his New Deal."
"Members of minority groups are sometimes victimized because of the color of their skin or other physical attributes. Such prejudice is sometimes exacerbated by religious intolerance or cultural stereotypes. The principal victims of racist and xenophobic violence are often described as \u201cvisible minorities,\u201d though this term may be misleading. Even a minority that is not easily distinguished by physical characteristics may stand out as \u201cdifferent\u201d because of differences in language, religion, and a variety of other cultural indicators, as is the case with many immigrants."
"Since then me and his family have gotten along very well and we are practically like family. We definitely enjoyed that week together but he had to go back and I wouldn\u2019t see him until May. My birthday came along and it happened to fall on a Saturday, which was nice because I planned to have a party. Isaac drove all the way home just for my birthday and surprised me. He called me before and said that he had sent a present. Then at around five in the afternoon he called and said that my gift has arrived and I had to open the door, sure enough it was him with a bouquet of flowers."
"Coffee and Weddington took it upon themselves to file a lawsuit against Henry Wade, a Dallas Country District Attorney. The case was eventually ruled unconstitutional because it was considered to be a woman\u2019s \u201czone of privacy\u201d and therefore protected by fundamental human rights. Roe v. Wade proved to be a huge accomplishment in both the women\u2019s right movement and also pro-choice support. Before the court case Roe v. Wade in 1973, approximately five thousand women died per year due to unsafe abortions. Abortion legality allows women to attain the procedure at the correct time and in a safe and way. Today, it is a very safe and common procedure in the United States but in countries where abortion is illegal, people continue to perform it but in dangerous and harmful ways and in these countries it is the leading cause of effects on maternal mortality. Keeping abortion legal in the United States is the best and safest solution for women."
"When people talk about diversity it goes beyond the color of skin since it cover also sexuality or gender, age, cultural orientation, religious beliefs and even economic status. The movie depicts what is like to be stereotyped or typecast in the society and how much the Whites have been more oppressive or dominant with their Black counterparts."
"At one point, Orsino depicts love dolefully as an \u201cappetite\u201d that he wants to satisfy and cannot, at another point; he calls his desires \u201cfell and cruel hounds\u201d. Olivia more bluntly describes love as a \u201cplague\u201d from which she suffers terribly. These metaphors contain an element of violence, further painting the love-struck as victims of some random force in the universe. Even the less melodramatic Viola sighs unhappily that \u201cMy state is desperate for my master\u2019s love."
"From school life to social life she says that the Chinese relationships are extremely tight. She tells me that she has not experienced direct racism and has been treated well by most that she has encountered since being in the U.S. Ms. Mao tells me that the Chinese do not have what westerners call religion because the majority feels as if they do not need it. According to her, most of her population would be classified as Buddhists but they would never refer to it as a religion. She says that generally, her people do not openly discuss their worship practices and that the society is far too conservative that."
"I took a trip down to St.Georges market for the first time the other day, to see what different stalls where there and if there where many ethnic communities there. Its amazing to think there are so many hate crimes in Northern Ireland as the atmosphere is friendly and many minorities such as Chinese and polish all interact while looking through hundreds of stalls ranging from, food, fruit, clothes and fish. \u2013 St.Georges market is a great place for restaurant owners to buy various foods in bulk for cheap prices."
"It should not be said that all poor people are sexually promiscuous by nature, and also despite their lifestyle conditions there are some people who challenge the restrictions put on the poor and attempt to escape to better things. When in search of employment many people within the impoverished society must resort to sex work. This is a choice they made in order to gain income that they can share with their disadvantaged family. In countries such as Thailand family members are supported and motivated by their kin to participate in the sex trade."
"\u200bIn order to reach my end goal of working as a strategist consultant, I first need to concentrate on getting the best grades as early as in my first year. A company like McKinsey is very specific that its employees have to have top-notch academic qualifications so a mere pass will not cut it. Luckily, I am still in my first year and I can find ways to keep my grades up. Secondly, I also have to graduate with my degree first, before looking for meaningful employment in any of the two companies. A degree is enough for me to land an entry position but because companies like McKinsey allow their employees to pursue higher learning, I can take my masters while still working to improve my chances of promotion in the future. Thirdly, I can sign up for summer jobs at my companies of interest so that I can learn more about the companies. If I successfully manage to find a job in the company every summer until I graduate, I will improve my chances of getting my dream job and also develop important skill sets."
"They may think that it has negative impacts on our wellbeing, work and academic life, and relationships. It\u2019s not only the older generation that holds this view, but also much of the younger and more tech-savvy generation. According to a poll from the Teen Advisory Board, seventy-five percent of teenagers polled agreed that social media negatively affects romantic relationships (Gowen). This may be a shocking result, as teenagers and younger people are generally seen using social media much more than anyone else."
"Creon knows deep down inside that he will be doing the right thing by letting Antigone go free. Although Creon wants Antigone to pay for breaking the law, his family ties with her prove to out shine his devotion to the law. As Creon orders the Choragos on what weapons to bring, he says, \u201cI buried her, I/ Will set her free\u201d (SceneV. 236). Creon realizes that his family ties with Antigone mean more to him than justice and he wants her to know that by freeing her himself. Creon wants to prove to Antigone that he does care about her safety and her future so he will set her free so she can go on living her life with Haimon."
"There is difficulty in distinguishing between real and fake friends. I think I have real friends, but in reality, they do not have the characteristics of true friends. We all have many friends, but there should be only one friend we trust. From the sayings of Imam Ali: \u201cBeware of your enemy once and your friend a thousand times\u201d, so a false friend is more dangerous than an open enemy. Francis Bacon had taken up all the points and sum up all of them in one sentence that, \u201cA false friend is more dangerous than an open enemy\u201d."
"Justice is the establishment of the principles of fairness. When one think about justice, in terms of equality, it has to be speaking about equal economic rights, equal educational and employment opportunities, equal divorce and child custody laws, and a uniform standard of sexual behavior as also the suffrage. The reasons for this call for justice is the understanding that men and women were invested with the same capabilities and the same consciousness of responsibility for their existence. When one think about justice in terms of abortion, the following facts are pertinent."
"Police brutality is something that has deep rooted history in our country. The racial tension established during the colonial days of slavery have never fully disappeared. Yes, the lives of African Americans have improved and more opportunities are available, but the underlying problem needs to be addressed. Police officers, lawmakers and all of those in authority need to be held accountable for their lack of action in this epidemic plaguing the country. The steps towards ending brutality are doable, especially in a community that promotes it."
"Another program that has been set in place to help parents with their children is the Family Treatment Program for Ranch Ehrlo Society in Regina. The program is meant to help parents work out any sort of problems in their family using group and individual therapies. The program has parent support groups, recovery groups, parental education, 24/7 dad groups, horse therapy and writing groups. The program caters to the family in question, there is even housing for those that need it, and services to help children with specific needs (developmental delays and such) (Ranch Ehrlo Society 2017). This is a good program to have not only the for children but for the parents as well, everyone can learn and grow in this situation. These kinds of programs are needed across the country to help all those that need help. The direct one-on-one and the"
"The movie Crash shows many aspects of prejudice and discrimination. Crash explores many social encounters that are defined by different characters of\u00a0the movie. I think Crash represents the race relations in America and shows that how misconceptions and lack of communication makes our life situations very unstable. On the other hand, Healey\u2019s Book Race, Ethnicity, Gender & Class have helped us with more understanding of prejudice and discrimination by giving us different combinations of racism and prejudice and by providing all important definitions."
"Before I\u2019m going to discuss about the different and the useful of each search engine, I want to talk a little about my dream job. My dream job is to become a Mechanical Engineering and I\u2019m going to used these different types of search engine to find information that relate or useful to my dream job. My main purpose is to search for the number of open jobs for Mechanical Engineering in the U."
"It shows the value of them being a friend and how dedicated they are to you. Loyalty keeps a friendship going and plays a very important role. A true loyal friend will never betray you regardless of the circumstances. It\u2019s important for a friend to display loyalty as one of the most prized qualities to help bind the friendship together. You can\u2019t expect someone to give you loyalty if they can\u2019t be honest or trust you. Even when friends disagree, you will still tell them the truth about the situation."
"Beginning in 1824 and going through 1828, Andrew Jackson was president. Jackson\u2019s victory in the elections brought about the age of the common man. After the inauguration, there was a party held for everyone not just the high ranking government officials which really showed America how we had gone from an aristocracy to a democracy. The temperance movement is the reflection of democratization in America."
"In trying to keep with the ideas and philosophies of Starbucks, Mr.\u00a0Ogo was the leader of a special diversity team committed to the idea on inclusion in not just places like Portland, but the entire Starbucks communities. \u201cWe believe in the idea of inclusion. Instead of focusing on a hard number, we need to create an environment that has a spirit of inclusion. That\u2019s more important. It\u2019s not just color, age, gender or sexual orientation. It\u2019s about what you identify yourself as and having an environment that you feel comfortable in\u201d. As the former VP of Diversity and inclusion, it was their mission to create this exact type of environment where everyone feels comfortable and welcome."
"Black players within the game are routinely subject to overt racism at games (Gruneau,.(1999).Although not as frequently, they and their families can still be subjected to covert racism.In recent times institutional racism has never been far from the public eye especially in light of the Stephen Lawrence enquiry about his murder and the subsequent investigation that followed which was dogged by institutional racism (MacPherson,1999).Football and the structure of the game would also appear to being affected by institutional racism.There are very few Black coaches and managers being employed. Indeed what are the sociological effects this is having and how are these theories affecting the game of football ?"
"The most explicit example of a role giving one identity in the novel is Curley\u2019s wife, who remains unnamed throughout the novel, like the boss, and it is clear that she had no identity before her marriage to Curley: she may have hoped, that by the marriage and gaining a form of identity she may achieve her dream of going to Hollywood. However, it is in Slim that we see that a job can give you not only identity, but also authority. Slim receives the longest description of any character in the novel (page thirty four/thirty five) and most of this passage describes his job. He is a \u201cjerkline skinner\u201d and was capable of \u201cdriving\u202620 mules in a single line\u201d and \u201ckilling a fly\u2026the mule\u201d and these show that Slim\u2019s authority is gained not only by the \u201cmajesty\u201d in which he walked, but also because he was a valued worker and he had mastered his job, which was stable, unlike the other drifting ranch hands. Therefore, we can see that\u00a0identity and authority in Of Mice and Men\u2019s introductions reflects not only the conclusions of the novel but also the lifestyle of Americans during the Depression."
"The Representation of the encounter between white settlers-invaders and indigenous peoples in Jeannette Armstrong\u2019s \u201cHistory Lesson\u201d and Susanna Moodie\u2019s Roughing it in the Bush differ greatly in a number of ways. Writing at different times, for conflicting purposes, from opposing points of view as well as utilizing different literary mediums- the resulting representation of the encounter between the white and indigenous groups are inherently contrasting."
"The discoveries from the community drug specialist interviews demonstrate that there was exceptionally constrained directing utilizing bundle embeds and that advising was done on an \u2018impromptu\u2019 premise, especially with members whose first dialect was not English. The clear absence of utilization (and accessibility) of appropriate translators what\u2019s more, the hesitance by Latinos to utilize translators can be dangerous. The Cuban center female members did not remark on this issue notwithstanding when inquired. They were an exceptionally subservient gathering and the questioner discovered this issue hard to examine, even despite the fact that she was from the equivalent social foundation. Members from four center gatherings affirmed this was not a \u2018social\u2019 marvel. A few members shown that who they counseled (male or female human services proficient) relied upon what the issue was. They counseled medicinal services experts that could \u2018bargain with their concern and relied upon how \u2018touchy\u2019 the issue was. No member would tell the scientists precisely what they implied by \u2018delicate\u2019, despite the fact that the gatherings were sexual orientation isolated. The discoveries demonstrate a requirement for all the more ace dynamic and \u2018responsive\u2019 pharmaceutical service, where \u2018non-clinical\u2019 spaces are additionally considered in services plan and conveyance. Different social impacts and practices are pervasive inside the Latino people group furthermore, Latino individuals will continue being impacted by this."
"The theme of deception is ever-present throughout \u2018Much Ado About Nothing\u2019; the majority of the plot is based upon purposeful deception, some malevolent while others benign. The play itself, although set in Messina, Italy seems to echo the culture of Elizabethan society in which William Shakespeare lived; the importance of honour and pride at that time induced the need for the people to uphold this status through the constant deception of those around them, whether this was with appearances or words."
"On the other hand, it has been investigated by P.E Easterling that \u201cEuripides\u2019 many imitators have tended to present Medea\u2019s behaviour as that of madwomen\u201d. This is because the way in which Medea murders her children is largely brutal as she uses a sword and seem to be murdering them in a mercilessly pattern. Therefore, even the Ancient Greek audience seems to reject the idea of Medea being \u2018good and appropriate\u2019."
"Which lead into \u201cgun control is not about guns- it\u2019s about control\u201d (Mitchell). The idea that regulating the type of gun you can purchase, limiting the size of a magazine or background checks will stop murders like so many school shootings from happening is absurd. Any criminal will find his or her way to get their hands on any type of weapons that comes thrown at their way. Gun requirements vary throughout the United States, although there are some basic federal laws which affect the U. S. nationwide."
"I.T.V now presents a polished and stylish programme for the fans along with a Black pundit and a female presenter,unheard of in previous decades (Giulonotti,1999). Broadsheet newspapers now actively report about football at great length.This domain was primarily reserved to the tabloid press and low quality magazines. Stadiums have changed for a number of reasons e.g. the Taylor Report 1995 after Hillsborough.The disasters at Bradford and Hysel forced governing football agencies to evaluate the structure of stadiums and the fans that attended these stadiums.These changes have attracted different fans Evidence to support this can be seen in the growth of executive boxes at football grounds"
"* Padre Jose, a Spanish priest in Cabugaw serves a Minor Character in the novel. He was the one who helped Istak by giving him enough education, teaching him about medicine and other practical skills and by teaching him different languages such as Spanish and Latin. He akso helped Istak during their journey when he appeared in Istak\u2019s dream. The journey that Padre Jose and Istak had also helped Istak in journeying their way to pangasinan since Istak became familiar with the roads they are seeking that time."
"He wil never be called a \u2018blackie\u2019 or \u2018darky\u2019 to his face but behind his back the children will happily speak of him in such a foul way. Perhaps this is a reflection of one idea in the novel which is how Britain hides the racial prejudice present whereas in America it is more forward and obvious. Braithwaite uses the relationship between him and one of his students Pamela Dare to explore the themes of maturity, relationships and racism in the novel. Pamela is one of Greenslade High School\u2019s more intelligent students."
"Although I\u2019m gettin\u2019 on O.K at the ranch with all the other guys and stuff, I cant help thinkin\u2019 about the chance of Lennie and Curley gettin\u2019 into a fight coz Curley was real mean to Lennie earlier. If Curley tries to start a fight with Lennie then Lennie gonna have to smash him back. I know that Lennie would never mean to cause any trouble but if Curley starts i\u2019m gonna let Lennie fight back coz guys like Curley need to be taught a lesson. I ain\u2019t sittin\u2019 back and watching Curley beat up Lennie coz that ain\u2019t right."
"Every one has his or her own way of learning . This learning process starts from birth and keeps on till death. There are two types of learners i.e. Independent Learner and Dependent Learner. No one can be an independent learner from the first day of life. Moreover, one has to depend directly or indirectly on others in many different ways throughout life. One learns from his parents initially, the learning process continues from family members to friends and teachers to colleagues etc."
"For example, Ponyboy stayed with Johnny after Johnny killed Bob, the Social. Although Ponyboy didn\u2019t kill him, he stayed with Johnny to help him through the tough time. When Johnny went to the hospital after saving children from a burning building, Ponyboy stayed at the hospital for a long time and visited him everyday until he died. For Mark, even though he really wanted to summit Everest, when he found out that his dad\u2019s cancer had spread to his brain Mark decided to stay home to support his father."
"Jobs will get you money for your great future. So respect can do lots of things that will help us with our future. Respect is ten times easier to lose then it is to gain. Respect can be lost in an instant one word, one decision or one action can lose a person their respect. So never stop caring! Respect and Leadership go together. You can\u2019t have one without the other."
"Scientists put together an experiment which compared the brain of a serial killer and a normal person using a CAT scan. The results showed that the serial killers brain was covered in black spots, while the normal person\u2019s brain only had two miniscule black spots. If a child\u2019s brain is already that irregular, how can they recover from that? People are fighting to convince the courts that sentencing a child to die in prison violates the eighth amendment, for it is cruel and unusual. \u201cIn 1988, the Supreme Court ruled that no person under the age of sixteen may be executed for a crime."
"His father questions about Maria\u2019s conduct and her behavior throughout their journey to the house. It was test designed to see if she can adjust and accept the life of village and make it her home. Baldo reassures him about her live for Leon and commitment to their marriage. He confirms his observation that Maria was ready to embrace their house as her home."
"With their landing card, American money, train ticket, and luggage in hand, the immigrants were ready to leave Ellis Island and embark on their journey in America. If you are ever bored some Sunday afternoon I suggest going to Ellis Island\u2019s website where you can enter your ancestor\u2019s name and do a passenger search. According to thestatueofliberty.com, today, over 40% of America\u2019s population can trace their ancestry through Ellis Island. I found all of my great-great grandparents\u2019 names and their information on the manifest sheets, and it truly is amazing to see."
"In this chapter the setting and rationale for choosing this specific location to implement this program will be discussed as well as the population that will benefit from this program. The methodological framework, outcome measures, data analysis methods, assumptions, limitations, supports and barriers will also be identified within this chapter."
"Issues revolving around the constitutionality of building a U.S \u2013 Mexico barrier arise from the funding process, as well as the acquisition of land from native American nations, specifically from members of the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation who own 62 miles of border land in Texas. The Tohono O\u2019odham tribe is federally recognized, and they even have their own constitution. During the Gadsden Purchase, the United States paid Mexico $10 million for 29,670 square miles of land. As a result, the tribe\u2019s territory was split in half. As a result of building a barrier, the Tribe may be split once again, and their nation may dissolve. In addition to that, there is the issue of separation of powers. During the funding process for building the U.S \u2013 Mexico barrier, Donald Trump declared a national emergency in order to proceed with building the wall, even though congress refused to approve the funds. Because of this incident, there are discussions about restricting the president\u2019s power to declare national emergencies."
"Paula S. Tompkins defines moral imagination as, \u201cthe ability to recognize and consider ethical issues from different points of view, especially points of view that are different from your own.\u201d (Tompkins). Tompkins also explains, \u201cWithout a well-developed moral imagination, it is difficult to discern and deliberate about what is good, right, or virtuous to communicate.\u201d (Tompkins). In order to have an advanced moral imagination, it is important to be open and understanding about other people\u2019s thoughts and opinions. Having a good moral imagination can make an impact on today\u2019s society."
"He stuck his neck out to make sure they received the proper gear in order to fight. Shaw had finally decided to not let the grief from the prior battle to control him, he chose to help in the happiness of the slaves and continue to fight for their freedom. Saint Augustine Augustine\u2019s approach was not just brilliant, it was practical. His insight is intellectually credible and emotionally satisfying in that it gives hope and offers meaning to the Christian trying to make sense out of life in a fallen world (Sommers &amp; Sommers, 2010)."
"I am a mother of five children, three boys and 2 girls. I could do my own personal little study with the number of children I have and the age gap between their ages. My children rage in age from Twenty-one to five years old. I grew up in the age of the Nintendo System, cell phones were just becoming the new \u201ccool thing\u201d, I got my first cell phone in 1998, this was just one year before I graduated high school."
"Here, he taught me a lesson of balancing and prioritizing goals and responsibilities alike.. to make a good identity in public through in studies, through my family values.. The biggest joy for him has always been the smiles of his dear ones and even today he will go out of his way to ensure the smile remains through the years, the crucial lessons I am learning from him, evolving into a person I am and today when people say \u201d you just be like your father\u201d, there is no greater joy I feel\u2026.. because I always want to be like you my dad\u2026\u2026"
"In our society white-collar workers position are much higher. They are better paid and more respected in the work force. The minority, the African American workers are considered unskilled ensuing in hapless wage and non appreciated in the work force. These inequalities in the work environment are due to the givens our society teaches us about race. Throughout history African Americans have been an of import portion of the work force yet have bit by bit become disused."
"He argues that he is not just reporting violent acts by the White Man, but actually enjoying them as one cannot remark any sign of disapproval against brutality in his work. Equally, Robert Buchanan, in his book, was bitterly charging Kipling with violence as he describes him as \u201cthe voice of the hooligan\u201d. Max Beerbohm as well, \u201cin his famous parody of Kipling in A Christmas Garland, mimicked the pathological reveling in cruelty which, to Beerbohm, seemed a chief distinguishing feature of Kipling\u2019s work\u201d (Gilbert 207). This accusation takes a very negative view of imperialism which is depicted as a morally and materially destructive move whose real purpose is subjugation which is a total contradiction to civilization. 2.3.4- Kipling\u2019s accusation of exploitation"
"In my opinion, I do agree with the fact that converting a slave into a free being would take generations of freedom beforehand. I would compare this situation to the institutionalization of prison inmates. Even when they are released, they have been accustomed to a certain way of living and for the majority, cannot function in normal society without those boundaries that were set on them by the judiciary institution."
"The ethical or unethical use of force is determined by the community, society, and often a judge and jury. Today\u2019s society there are often electrical devices that capture uses of force which are often used against Law Enforcement, these devices often capture a use of force that had gone bad like in the Rodney King case for example . The Misuse of authority like in the case against Chief Charlie Beck in the Los Angeles Police Department the outcome and concerns with a case like this."
"However, most American schools ignore these differences and all children are judged on the behavioral characteristics of children belonging to the white middle class which is considered the only valid expression of competence. Hence children from minority groups are judged as inadequate. This is largely due to their inability to conform to these foreign standards (Bowman, 1994). The educational programs of American public schools are poorly designed and do not cater to cultural differences."
"It is misconceived by a number of individuals that individuals having disabilities may not be productive members of the society. The major negative attitudes either include that the individuals having disabilities are sick or broken and need healing or fixing, or even that are good for nothing and require being cared of (Correa, 2000)."
"The attachment theory is a component of psychological theories. According to John Bowlby, the components of the attachment theory beginning with a bond between people through childhood experiences (Bowlby, 1990). If a child is denied any emotional need such as a strong, natural, emotional bond the child may eventual find the emotional bond elsewhere such as gangs and possibly becoming juvenile delinquents (Schmalleger, 2012). The second theory is the social process theory which governs the thoughts on how someone may have become the person he or she are currently. Researchers have debatable beliefs that a person\u2019s behavior comes from the environment around him or her. The ethical perspective of the children exposed to domestic violence may be corrupted. Ethical absolutism which is the decisions made is based on past experiences."
"Sam insists Hally is now old enough to open his eyes, stand up, and walk away from such benches, and thereby discard any intolerance of racial prejudice. The aftermath of the spitting scene, however, is far more destructive than any punishment, as Hally must carry with him the knowledge that he has gravely wronged one of his truest friends. Sam\u2019s lesson helps Hally, however. He understands what it means in the dance of life, of trying to create the perfect dance \u2013 to not bump into one another."
"SYMBOLSIM \u2013 rabbits representing Lennie\u2019s dreams of owning land. IMAGERY \u2013 Steinbeck uses imagery before the introduction of each character to give them definition from one another and give the reader insight to what sort of character archetype they are . SIMILIE \u2013 \u201cand flies shot like rushing stars.\u201d This simile is used to show the conditions of the bunk house and how the workers were connected to nature."
"Most of the children and teen deaths are done by another child or teen that has access to a firearm. Baton Rouge is widely known through the state for being state capital but also being murder capital. A gun is even allowed to be carried on a college campus in Louisiana as long as its legal and it has to be concealed with proof of a permit. Baton Rouges murder rate has gone up at least ten percent a year for the last five years. 2017 was by far the worst year yet for Baton Rouge because they almost caught up with Chicago\u2019s murder rate by firearms that year. And everyone knows that is not an easy task, noting that Chicago has record-breaking numbers almost every year when it comes to murder and violence. In 2017, East Baton Rouge Parish had a record high of one-hundred and six killings due to firearms that year. The record was broken in 2017, topping 2007\u2019s record of 96 firearm deaths. The year of 2017 actually went up seventy-percent from 2016\u2019s year having only sixty-two firearm deaths. Someone is killed almost every week in Baton Rouge, La due to firearm outrage and weak laws."
"Another example critical would be that a student cannot make an available schedule to take the final exam, therefore he or she has to drop the courses due to the unavailability of attending to the exam in order to complete the course. Every students would start to take different courses ever since they get into school, and it means from the time high school started, everyone student would learn different curriculums and start to have differences in terms of academic knowledge."
"But she eventually became accustomed to the new ways and she learned how to adjust. And of course she went through many years of discrimination and persecution, simply because of the fact that she is a Native American. But in the long run, wall the challenges she overcame helped to improve herself as an individual and as a representative of a culture."
"That is an important point; because when one has an abortion she is under the anaesthetic \u2013 to not feel anything. The truth is even when one does not feel anything it \u2018invents a different pain\u2019 \u2013 there is not physical pain, but the emotional pain is unbearable. That is the point in her life where she stopped to feel (Atwood 22) or weep (Atwood 166). Neither is she able to love (Atwood 36), because there is no one to \u2013 her unborn baby is dead and her lover, who claims that he loves her, disappointed her by forcing to the abortion; and dream (Atwood 37), because there is nothing to dream about anymore."
"Happiness is not only a kind of emotions, but also an attitude of living. I am sure that everyone here at least experienced happiness in the life, but not all the people think highly of the happiness. Thus, I encouraged everyone to be happy as it can be one of the most pivotal goals of our living. To begin with, let\u2019s have a deep look at this world. How can we perceive the world? According to Tanya and Staff, \u201cWhat people think they perceive is actually filtered and processed by the brain to construct a useful view of the world\u201d(Tanya)."
"Clubs can also be expensive and cash consuming, money is also a big issue for families as well. With this money issue, parents and students must also put a lot of time into clubs and that can lead to academic failures. Lack of time at home can make a student fall behind on their homework assignments or study time this can cause grades and stress to fluctuate themselves, quite commonly, in negative ways."
"Intensity: \u2013 This took place one month after attachment behaviour first appeared. But there is a large individual difference. Schaffer and Emerson observed that intensely attached children had mothers who responded quickly to their demands and had more interactions. Infants that had a weak attachment had mothers who did not interact as much."
"I couldn\u2019t agree more with his argument. Overall, men need to unite to stand against violence towards women in order to stop the violence today, save lives and shape a better future for up coming generations. Getting men to understand the severity of this issue is prominent in order for them to step in and do something."
"In opposition, some people prefer to lead a hectic lifestyle in the city. Moreover the social and geographical environment in which one lives and is raised, is just one of many factors that develops our identity. Identity does not belong in isolation. Interactions with friends, family and other help to define it. It is here that we realise there is more than just one factor that contributes to our persona. Inheritance of personality plays a large role in forming a sense of self because environmental pressures are of no interest at a young age. Because of this, our parent\u2019s influence will directly play a role in shaping our forever developing character. The desire to belong is another significant factor that can influence our identity. Because it is human nature to strive for a sense of belonging, it is notoriously difficult to balance being part of a group while retaining ones sense of individual identity. As a result we often make decisions on our identity and personality in order to conform to groups within society."
"Spanking is a mild form of physical punishment, which is commonly used by parents as a form of discipline. Spanking has involved the act of striking the buttocks of the child to cause physical pain, generally with an open hand. Although spanking is a mild form of punishment but still spanking has many negative impacts on children with no positive outcome. According to Gershoff E.T (2013) \u201cSpanking is a form of violence\u201d (p.136). However, Den, A. Trumbell (2010) argues that \u201cspanking is an effective means of controlling the childhood behavior and most practical of all measures tested\u201d (para."
"Racism is a learned behavior and those who are teaching racism to their children today are not teaching them there are biological differences. I have friends whose parents have instilled racism in them and not once did I hear them state anything about the biological differences. I believe it\u2019s the social and cultural differences that cause racism today. I was aware of the racism and acts of racism in American history but in watching the film I was surprised how the white race was looked at as a pure race and was even protected by law in the 1920s to safeguard the pure white race."
"The only subject that girls were taught in school was language; reading and writing. Other courses included wifely responsibilities and activities such as knitting, midwife, cooking and waving among others (Burgess & Brown, 2000, p.118). Women began to form \u201cwomen rights movements\u201d which helped them in protesting against slavery as well as men dictatorships. These movements led to revolution which eventually led to the constitutional amendment processes which brought about the eradication of slavery. This was a great achievement on the women\u2019s history since they could freely speak out their views."
"On the right side of the result page, it has a list of useful information such as Salary Estimate, Title, Company, etc. The results were very clear and show as job opening only, without type in the term \u201cHow many open jobs for Mechanical Engineering\u201d This type of search engine is suit for people who ready to apply for a job because it\u2019s only giving out jobs description and\u00a0application for the search career. Thus, Google and About.com were both very useful online tools in the search for the dream career. They are both having its own unique way that giving the user the power to select and pick all the different options for their search topic. About.com (Jobs & Career category) is so focus on finding the open jobs for the career and it\u2019s lack in giving information about the career."
"So overall, when we have looked at all the sources provided and used other statements quoted we can see that, \u2018In the period 1949-1959 Black immigrants faced only discrimination and prejudice form whites\u2019, is not entirely true. I did not think sources A, C and G were useful towards the question first asked; they did not contain sufficient information."
"Here, Sula realizes that she has to fight against her own vulnerability, and establish her identity, hereby following her grandmother Eva\u2019s example. Though this moment shows Sula\u2019s inner strength, it can never disguise her enough of being different from the rest of her community. Just as Eva and Hannah, Sula continues the unpreventable, mature line of breaking past the typical gender roles of the time. Eva\u2019s overly independent attitude and removal from caring and mothering a daughter correctly, leaves her daughters with unlearned, societal caretaking skills."
"John Howard Griffin\u2019s research should undeniably be considered sociological. He began with a theory, if he became black he could help understand the difficulties between races as both a white man and a black man in the south and with this knowledge develop a means to bridge the gap. With this information he developed a micro-theory, trying to explain a limited part of human behavior; why is there hate among blacks and whites? He collected his data in a process of explanatory research."
"In the end, what my father was trying to teach me was that there are benefits for those that work hard, and none for those that don\u2019t. In conclusion, I thank my father for being there to teach me how to be a hardworking man, the importance of being responsible, and how nothing comes easily. He taught me that when a person works hard for a living, they reap the benefits of that hard work. My father is my super hero; I wish every child could have been as fortunate as I was to have their father around."
"These dealing brought with them many negative consequences. I was expelled from schools, hooked on drugs, had a juvenile criminal record, and was failing school. My life seemed more difficult than others for some reason. There appeared to be no hope for this fatherless child. My mother, with the help of strong male family friend, admitted me to drug rehabilitation at Kaiser and helped me get my life together. A family friend assumed the role of a father in my life and helped me learn what it was to be a man. I got off drugs, graduated high school, and became heavily involved in sports and the arts."
"b) This makes me kind of sad that this kind of game is made exclusively for the white population. The fact that anything is just reserved to whites kind of make me mad because I thought that anything was open to me and everyone else if we really wanted it."
"In 2010 another revised version of the bill passed the House of Representatives but the failed in the Senate being the closest year where the bill would have passed (Ruth, M). Recently polls have shown a drastic public support from fellow Americans allowing the dreamers to remain in the United States (Barnes, R.). The program was supposed to give them a chance to build a life here and start a family of their own regardless of their parents\u2019 choices. So, children who crossed illegally into the United States with their parents could never become legal residents or citizens because their parent\u2019s illegal actions of residing in the United States illegally. Supporters of the Dream Act asserted the law adjusting it to protect the children from suffering for their parents\u2019 illegal actions (Ruth, M)."
"This contradicts the exclusion act because it shows Irish and Germans being cruel to a Chinese man because they are immigrants too. This is ironic because they were once going thru the same troubles to be in America. Also \u201cColumbia\u201d is supposed to agree with her U. S. laws but disputes the laws in every way. According to Thomas Nast in his cartoon points out how the Chinese immigrants where brutally treated by, also, former immigrants. Although there is much evidence to show that U. S. laws exclude Chinese people, an analysis of the document contradicts that not all American great names and great people support with this act. This is demonstrated by showing Ms. Columbia protecting poor Chinese immigrant and stating that \u201cAmerica means fair play for all men\u201d In the \u201cAutobiography of a Chinese immigrant\u201d written in 1903 by Lee Chew, dialogues about his point of view on why they were treated gravely; and his reasons were because of their virtues, and how they were better than any other Irish, German, or Italian."
"During this period,I will also attend some relevant courses abou reader\u2019s response theory. Then I will spend about six months i questionnaires and interviews. After that,I plan to spend eight months i analyzing the statistics and data. Finally,four month will be used mainl on the thesis. February 2008\u2013Aug. 2008 *Develop proposal and methodology and complete the literatur review *Attend some relevant courses about reader\u2019s response theory Aug. 2008\u2013Feb. 2009 *Design the questionnaires Collection of official and unofficia statistic Feb. 2009-October 2009."
"Find a better life \u2013 is, in most cases \u2013 to search for work. The enormity of unemployment, the collapse of the economy, the absence of at least hints at the \u201cwelfare state\u201d \u2013 all of this is an everyday reality for a large number of \u201cperipheries\u201d. In this situation, people are willing to work for the lowest paid jobs in wealthier countries, at the most abominable conditions, without any social protection at the level of a slave and an illegal immigrant but it is better than to die of hunger in their country."
"For example if we ask: Why are you studying? -To get a good waged job. Why do you want to get a good waged job? \u2013To be able to satisfy my material needs. Why do you want to do so? -To be happy, which is the final goal. Thus, happiness is an end goal, for the sake of which humans accomplish many other different actions, which sometimes might be difficult, but definitely will fulfill their lives. Happiness is the ultimate destination and there is nothing beyond it, as we pursue happiness for its own sake. Influential philosophers like Epicurus, Plato, John Locke and Thomas Jefferson also agree with Aristotle on his conclusion that happiness is an end goal. John Locke, an English philosopher, known as the most authoritative figure of Enlightenment intellectuals, in his book \u201cAn Essay Concerning Human Understanding\u201d wrote: \u201c\u2026the highest perfection of intellectual nature lies in a careful and constant pursuit of true and solid happiness\u2026\u201d (Locke, 1690, p. 348)."
"Overall, Will did undergo the four identity statuses and experience the crises that James Marcia and Erik Erikson proposed in their theories of self-discovery. Will\u2019s relationship with Skylar particularly proves that Will underwent the four identity statuses of moratorium, foreclosure, diffusion, and achievement because of his refusal to get emotionally attached to her at first, and then by the conclusion of the movie, ready to commit his life to her. Also, through the guidance of Sean Will overcame the identity crises of future work and moral standards. In the end, although it appeared as if Will could never behind his reputation of a South Boston rebel, through his relationships with Skylar and Sean Will was prepared to reach his full potential."
"So, by the time it was my turn to go to college she had already taken loans to help my other siblings get through school. So not only did I have to take out student loans, I had to increase them as well because there was a little issue with the state of Illinois not approving a budget for the school. (TCO 5)."
"This is represented by a wooden scarecrow wearing ragged clothing and is inside the bin for getting rid off, just like all of Hoover\u2019s over policies and ideals. The fact that it is a scarecrow wearing ragged and torn clothes shows us, I believe, that Hoover\u2019s \u2018rugged individualism\u2019 had worked the American population too hard and starved them of support and reducing them to poor, weak men who wear torn clothes and cannot support themselves anymore. Also in the bin is a rolled up blanket. I believe this refers to the \u2018Hoover blanket."
"The reconstruction lasted from 1867 to 1877, in 1876 president Rutherford B. Hayes lost the popular vote against Democratic candidate Samuel Tilden by almost 250, 000 votes, but he won the electoral votes, the dispute over the presidency was sent back to Congress which led to the 1876 compromise. The Democrat will award the electoral votes to Hays if he promised to end the reconstruction effort and withdrew the federal troops remaining in some of the southern states putting an end to the ten years reconstruction effort to rehabilitee the southern states and as well as readmitting almost three million former slaves into the societies."
"Globalization of human capital has also favored proliferation of modern world migration. Skilled and semi skilled laborers are moving from countries where they are heavily concentrated to areas where such skills are in short supply. For instance, multiple Chinese companies are on the verge of importing skilled Chinese human capital to several African countries due to the short supply of specialized human capital (Economist). Besides, the proliferation of semi skilled labor demand in American and Canadian firms has attracted multilingual speakers such as Chinese and Arabs to work in various positions such as call centers and customer support desks."
"Despite the clarion call from the government and child care practitioners through various policy pronouncements such as the National Orphan Care Policy prohibiting the institutionalisation of OVCs, orphans and vulnerable children continue to be admitted and raised in residential care institutions. This is in direct contradcition with the Zimbabwean culture of \u2018ubuntu\u2019 or \u2018humwe\u2019 which values the role of the extended family and the community in raising children. It sad to note that residential care institutions continue to exists as islands, without comprehensive interaction between institutionalised children and the surrounding communities. This phenomena has led communities to develop various unjustified attitudes towards institutionalized children. This phenomena is partly attributed to attitudes that are held by local communities towards children\u2019s homes. Such negative attitudes have contributed to the stigmatization of orphans and other vulnerable children (OVC) which have created a barrier towards proper integration of institutionalised children into the mainstream society upon their discharge. Over the past years, the Department of Social Services has made frontic efforts by ensuring that institutionalised children are taken out of institutions and placed with foster parents in the wider communities during school holidays. This is meant to demonstrate that institutionalised children are humans too and are entitled to equal treatment like any other children in Zimbabwe. Paradoxically, there has been no change in terms of attitudes towards children living in institutions by the communities. This study is therefore aimed at evaluating the community\u2019s attitudes towards institutionalised children."
"Another way childhood can affect whether or not a person has a prejudice is their family and how they were raised. If a child see\u2019s their family or parents using racial slurs or putting down a race for any reason, that child could grow up to be the same way and think it is acceptable to have a prejudice. The effect of that could be going in public or at school using derogatory comments towards a race and thinking that it is alright and hurting someone\u2019s feelings."
"Cultural differences can be very deep and possibly, irreconcilable. For instance, Native American concepts regarding work and property are quite different from English traditions. Historically, the resolution of these irreconcilable differences involved attempts to destroy Native American cultures and replace them with Western traditions. In recent times, Native Americans rebelled against this cultural genocide and domination with demands for cultural restoration."
"Green cross code according to age Always put yourself between the road and the child hen possible Use restraints/reins where applicable Don\u2019t allow children to run ahead Teach children about stranger danger particularly when in parks and adventure playground. Ultimately, once disciplines have been put in place in the different areas when supervising children, then this will ultimately assist when determining the levels of supervision required as the safety of the child is paramount in any home based child care setting. Also having procedures in place when out and about in case children get lost or separated is considered as good practice for any child-minder."
"Feminism is reflected in \u201cA sorrowful woman because of how the wife doesn\u2019t feel well due to her usual duties. What it\u2019s reflecting on is how sometimes women start to feel that they\u2019re tired of the usual duty they have inherited from their marriage. They\u2019re tired of their duties to the point where they stopped doing their role. Another reason why feminism is reflected on the story is because the woman wants to become solitary. Since the wife doesn\u2019t even want to interact with her child."
"This is repeated a lot throughout the poem. Rhetorical questions were very effective in this poem as it made the reader think imagine what the phrase half-caste means. Another technique that Agard uses is repetition; \u2018what yu mean when yu say half-caste\u2019. This demonstrates that John wants to emphasise this phrase. Repetition helps the reader to think about what half-caste actually means because it shows that there is no real definition and that it is the reader\u2019s own interpretation of the word."
"The most unusual thing in all of this is the shock of Lord Capulet shock to Juliet\u2019s answer. He almost is shocked at the audacity his daughter has to refuse him. This is an unexpected reaction that we as readers would not expect, wasn\u2019t he a man a couple of acts a go saying that Juliet\u2019s decision is the most important. Now we start to wonder was he at all liberal to start with or was it a ploy to get Juliet to consent and make him look good or was it that he never thought that Juliet would ever refuse. Lady Capulet\u2019s reaction to this full-blown family argument is to take the back seat and makes no noticable attempt to save her daughter and lets Lord Capulet throw all these insults at their only daughter. The only feeble attempt she makes is \u201cyou are too hot\u201d. Which is Lady Capulet trying to calm Lord Capulet\u2019s hot temperament. Lady Capulet even goes on to even disown Juliet \u201cdo as thou wilt, for I have done with thee\u201d Which shows Lady Capulet has given in to Juliet and therefore washes her hands of her. This is the last nail in the coffin for Juliet. Romeo and the nurse are now her only remaining pillars of strength."
"Lee is depicted as a gentleman, a religious, patient, and a man of honor without vices. He is optimistic and idealistic and believes that his men are capable of doing anything. He is soft-spoken and caring to his men; however, he boldly uses his men and is ready to loose them for a worthy cause. He adopts a religious stand in the war; God is responsible for all the events in the war. Lee is portrayed as a risk taker; he takes risky and daring decisions and is often breaking rules if time is against him. Lee is easily contrasted with Longstreet, a moody man of deep emotions and strong opinions. Longstreet is full of anger and hatred of the War. He believes that the War is a mistake and contests Lee\u2019s offensive approach. Longstreet prefers establishing a strong defensive position and letting the enemy come to him. He is not portrayed as a coward, but he basis his decisions on the War on the several years of his experience in the army. He is depicted as a total soldier who is devoted to no other cause other than victory in the War. Furthermore, he employs newer approaches in the War compared to Lee\u2019s conventional approaches and is pained by the death of the soldiers. Thus, contrasting the two generals and their strategies in the War depict that Longstreet was a more superior general with better tactics in the War. Lee\u2019s tactics were responsible for the death of many soldiers and the eventual loss of the War by the Confederacy."
"The \u201cChildren\u2019s Book Award\u201d is an award for children\u2019s books, books considered of a reading age range of infancy to the early teenage years. The award is owned and run by the Federation of Children\u2019s Book Groups, a charity whose mission is to encourage children to read and share a love of children\u2019s literature. Unlike other children\u2019s literature awards, it is the only national award voted for solely by children from start to finish."
"It has been shown that on small plots diversity indeed reduces the invasibility of communities. However, there is no evidence that more species -rich communities can repel invaders completely. Establishment of alien species takes place, although the performance of the invaders is affected negatively by the president s (Levine et al. 2004). So, the term \u201cbiotic containment\u201d (Levine et al. 2004) might be more appropriate to address the effects of diversity on invasibility at fine spatial scales."
"Where do you see yourself in five years? I see myself in five years being graduated from college with my bachelor\u2019s degree. I plan on graduating at the top of my class and working hard to excel my way to the top at my job. I hope to be employed in either Montana or Wyoming as the head nurse in a facility. Where do you see yourself in ten years? In ten years I hope to be firmly established in my job and on the way of raising a family. By then, I want to own my own house and have a stable income to provide for myself and family. Also, in ten years I plan on being at the top of my career ladder."
"For example, during the MSNBC news report Tim Wise stated, \u201cWhen you are a member of a group that\u2019s been able to take for granted its normalcy, its centrality to the narrative of what America means and you have to suddenly share that designation with people who don\u2019t look like you, pray like you, have different cultural backgrounds, you could imagine that person feels decentered.\u201d"
"As Jackie grows up she starts to feel guilty about giving Rosie up. When Rosie and Jackie go away to Venice, this is when Jackie realises how much she has lost and what she has had to sacrifice in order to be successful. She also feels guilty because Margaret had to look after Rosie during the hard years; Margaret \u201csat up all night with the sick child\u201d. Jackie is also responsible, she accepts that she has lost the best years. Jackie is also unable to form a close relationship with Rosie because she never gets to see her because of work."
"However she is eventually rewarded for her devotion when she discovers her fathers will, which, although worthless, leaves to her a portion of his estate equal to that received by her eldest brothers Gregory and Edgar and greater than that of her sister Lydia who received nothing. This shows that her years of seeking her father\u2019s approval eventually left her successful in winning his approval. This gives the book a happy ending which balances the tragic tale of Adeline\u2019s childhood and means the story in general is more inspiring than depressing which makes it more enjoyable for the reader."
"Sophie was brought out of her daydream by Dr. Monahan wheeling a large machine towards his desk. \u201cI saw on your chart that this is your fourth try\u201d Dr. Monahan said to neither of them in particular. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re both familiar with the process. Nonetheless, I will be walking you through it as we go. Sophie, I need you to lift your blouse so that I can disinfect your stomach\u201d. Sophie lifted her blouse as Dr. Monahan wiped her stomach with a disinfectant wipe. He wheeled the large silver machine closer to Sophie as he crouched down to grab four white wires. \u201cThis is the Reverse Ultra Sensory Screen that I will be using to conduct the simulation. I\u2019ll be inserting four needles into your stomach in different spots- this will allow for not only us to view the simulation, but most importantly for the fetus to view the simulation\u201d. Sophie squirmed as Dr. Monahan poked the needles into her stomach. She was now sitting upright on a cushioned chair, wired to a machine that resembled a refrigerator. \u201cI\u2019m going to need a blood sample from both of you for the machine\u201d Dr. Monahan said as he reached his hand to take Ronan\u2019s. He wiped Ronan\u2019s index finger with a disinfectant wipe and pricked him with a small lancet pen. Dr. Monahan collected the bead of blood off Ronan\u2019s finger using a pill sized clear capsule and popped it into the machine. Sophie lifter her hand, palm side up to Dr. Monahan who pricked her finger with a clean lancet and collected her blood in a similar clear pill sized capsule for the machine. Dr. Monahan fed the prior filled in questionnaire to the machine.\u201dAs you will notice, there is a small screen on this device\u201d the doctor said as he gestured to a five by ten screen, no bigger than one on an airplane. \u201cThe Reverse Ultra Sensory Screen is booting, when it has finished loading, the wires attached to you, Sophie, will make it possible to watch your lives with the fetus unfold before your very eyes. I will not be present for the simulation as what happens during the process is confidential and most of the time, emotional. I will be back when I am alerted that the simulation has finished and that we have a final result\u201d. The machine beeped four times signaling that the simulation was ready to be viewed. Dr. Monahan pressed a button below the screen and started for the door; he dimmed the lights and walked out. Ronan and Sophie held hands as the simulation started playing."
"Through Training and Discussion: Training and discussions are essential to raise awareness of diversity, equality and inclusion in any work settings. Discussion in meetings or group discussion among staffs play a vital role to raise awareness of equality, diversity and inclusion. The more they will engage in discussion or obtain trainings about this issue the more they will learn and be aware of and also they will be able and put them in their every day\u2019s practice."
"These circumstances created a lonesome curmudgeon. He found it easier to embitter himself against the actions of others and to push them away than to allow himself to hope for a friend. He was jealous of the camaraderie of the other ranch hands and yet when Lennie came to him when all the other men were at the cathouses, he became more concerned about Lennie invading his living space than being able to have someone to talk with. After he overcame his immediate reaction and he realized that he had someone who would talk with him, Crooks began to talk about his past."
"It is as if Lennie is trying to impress George. This is quite strange, between grown men of around the same age \u2013 remembering that Lennie is a fully grown man, but has the mind of a five year old. The author uses historical context as a method and 3rd person narration to allow other people\u2019s views about George and Lennie to be expressed, \u201cI never seen one guy take so much trouble for another guy.\u201d This implies, that even form one of the first characters that George and Lennie come across, we already get the impression that others think that Lennie and George have a weird friendship and an unlikely bond."
"Also, identity thieves gain access to crucial information and enact illegal activities by going over unshredded confidential documents, engaging in the misuse of private information acquired at the work place, changing someone else\u2019s address deliberately and indiscreetly to intercept confidential mail, stealing wallet and laptops that contain sensitive information, and obtaining information through hacking, illegal software, phising, pretexting and skimming. Loss of funds and credit violations can cause an unsuspecting person to feel helpless, frustrated and angry."
"The social expectation of how and what we should do and the roles of what we should become based on our age or gender is just an ideal self and not always become the best self. There\u2019s no such perfection where our life path just goes smooth as a river or theory assumption, instead of life challenges. Just like what the research mentions above of adolescents who had bad attitudes toward life and replaces into drinking behavior, in later years their behavior remains the same or even increasing and that\u2019s nothing to do with the experience of the new role. That proves that social expectation doesn\u2019t always pressure people to fit on those expectations. As people grew up and mature, they had a deal with many experiences in life that might shape them as a strong and tough personality, they become clearer about life and know what exactly what they want, even though sometimes their behavior or attitudes is deviated from what society expects."
"Moreover, family values are established by trustworthiness, accountability, integrity, and communication. These four values are the ones I believe brings the unity of a family. However, without family values being established in a home, it could potentially bring chaos. Therefore, the importance of \u201cvalues\u201d can strengthen morals of a person. For instance, the book states that communication can be served as the process of which family members create and share their meaning with each other. Also, members develop a relational culture, or shared a worldview.\u201d (Galvin, Braithwaite, Bylund, Pg.3) With that being said, being raised in a home with good morals can allow me to apply these values out into the world because it is ingrained in my belief systems."
"Most convincing evidence has emerged from linkage studies. Linkage on various chromosomes like 2q48, 5q49, 5p50, 8q51, 19p52 and 19q53. strongest linkage on chromosome 2q and specifically linkage to the gene responsible for sodium channel receptors and specifically mutation in the alpha subunit of the first neuronal sodium channel gene. The linkage on chromosomes 2q and 19q associated with the phenotype of febrile seizures, generalized epilepsy (tonic-clonic, absence, and myoclonic), and a continuation of febrile seizures (.5 years of age) (GEFS+),44 54 shows evidence of sodium channel involvement. There is currently no evidence that any of these loci have any role in the more common, \u201dsimple\u201d FS, with the possible exception of the chromosome 5 locus reported in the Japanese population."
"In conclusion, if you take one thing from this essay, I hope it is that not all undocumented immigrants are criminals and rapists. They are innocent people looking for a better life for themselves and their loved ones. Now that doesn\u2019t come to say that law and order doesn\u2019t go hand and hand with humanity. There are laws that need to be followed but there are more humane, effective alternatives as opposed to Donald Trump\u2019s policies. No human being should be treated less than just because they are from another country because the cold-hearted truth is, our graves will always be the same size."
"The Harvard law review is a journal that publishes eight regular annual issues of various legal articles by professors, judges, practitioners, and students. The purpose of this article is to show how the federal government is ultimately in charge of what happens to illegal immigrants and not the state. In California proposition 187 was approved in 1994 was designed \u201cto\u00a0make illegal aliens ineligible for most state and local government-provided social services, health care, and education.\u201d (1643) but then the paper goes on to state that \u201ca state has no power to prevent unlawful immigration, and no power to deport illegal aliens\u2026 if the federal government, properly chargeable with deporting illegal aliens, fails to do so, it should bear the burdens of their presence here.\u201d(1643) This means that even though they approved proposition 187, they have no power to get the illegal aliens out of the state so they would wind up having to pay for these people anyway."
"Because Jane and her family immigrated from Taiwan, I will focus on factors specific to Taiwanese emigration and both the historical and modern experiences of Asian American immigrants. In addition to analyzing these factors, I will also investigate the ways in which these factors have both challenged and upheld racial structures in the United States."
"The wife comes home to her largely inept spouse shopping in her hand once again showing that the dad is not responsible enough to do such thing and asks if that\u2019s her \u201cwedding dress\u201d he replies with \u201cIt could be\u201d. Some are probably thinking \u201d It\u2019s just one add, so what?\u201d There\u2019s lots of other advertisements and mass media that continuously uncover the flaws of all sorts of people, not just dads.\u00a0 Plus, you might be just saying this because, \u201cI bet you\u2019re a dad,\u201d.Well I can tell you I\u2019m defiantly not a dad just viewer of the media who notices a problem spiralling out of control and making a bad reputation for all dads out there when sure there are dads out in the world like this, but this does not depict who a dad truly is."
"The facial expression of the young woman is of alleviation, showing that she has a safe place for her and her child. The image is in some for a metaphor for the title, because it goes well together. The image connotates that the emotional consequences of violence can be extensive, this woman whether abused as an adult or a child, feels in some way responsible for what has happened to her. Perhaps this woman feels she is to blame, and is left believing she could have done something to avoid it. Perpetrators of violence sometimes use these feelings of self-blame, and even reinforce them, as a way of ensuring that their victims do not speak out."
"This was an urban, educated, literate and outspoken African American. Many whites felt threatened by the political nature of the \u2018New Negro\u2019. Some whites particularly those who belonged to or were influenced by the Ku Klux Klan, resorted to violence in response to their fear of growing African American confidence, prosperity, education and pride. So by 1925 the KKK had recruited up to 4.5 million white Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) members."
"Does he think I murdered that woman? I don\u2019t even know how I got here! All of these thoughts ran through my mind. I was a wrongly convicted criminal, about to be hung. I noticed another door in the large room, and I made my way over to it. There were no noises behind this door, so I did not even hesitate to open it and enter."
"A recent study conducted in Texas, shows that immigrants in cities and urban areas tend to drain the tax system more than they contribute to it; however, when the relationship of immigrants to tax dollars consumed was evaluated for the state as a whole, immigrants actually contribute more to the tax system than they receive, thereby creating a tax surplus simply due to their presence. Therefore, even if taxation is either unethical or a point of concern for citizens, there is still no reason to be fearful of a drain on the economy by immigrants (Weintraub 733)."
"He would chase after it as fast as he could, his ear flopping in the wind. When we couldn\u2019t play outside, we would play hide and go seek inside. I would go around the entire house trying to find the best hiding place I could while he waited in my room. Once I was hidden I would call him and he\u2019d run around the house, room to room until he found me. At night, I would stay up late talking to him about everything. I would tell him about this book I was reading or about this show I had watched on TV. To me he wasn\u2019t just a dog. He was my best friend. All either one of us needed was each other. But things change."
"The orphanage is a kind of movie which is suspensive enough to keep you staring at the TV without blinking. In spite of being known as a horror movie, the distressing scenes make the orphanage a sad heartbreaking movie. Teenagers will get a sense of suspense and curiosity and they will be excited and kind of upset by watching this horror and sad movie. The central idea of the film is that if you believe in yourself and your strengths you can achieve your goals whatever they are, as Laura does."
"These beliefs have no place in the world today and even though not everyone is directly blood-related, we all share a degree of kinship in the forms of being Americans, perhaps coming from the same hometowns, and sharing the same interests and hobbies just to name a few. The world would be a much better place if people could focus on instances where we are similar as a way of uniting instead of putting our greed and hatred for others who are different first. Although we still have a long way to go, it is important to learn from our mistakes in the past, such as slavery, to truly progress and reach our full potential as upstanding citizens and people of great character."
"As a result of global warming, extreme high temperatures will result in an increase of heat related deaths. However, it could also be seen as a way of saving lives as the temperature rises will also take affect in the winter months and thus reducing deaths from severe cold. It has been calculated that for a 1 degree increase in temperature for the UK would actually bring a reduction in the annual mortality rate by 7000 (Palutikof et al 2004). This only applies to the UK however, as an increase of 1 degree in a country such as Africa would have a devasting effect on the amount of people killed by heat exhaustion."
"2.2 Compare The Experience Of\u00a0Dementia For An Individual Who Has Acquired It As An Older Person With The Experience Of An Individual Who Has Acquired It As a Younger Person It would not be much different between an older and younger person, they would both still experience the same effects that dementia brings to a person. However a younger person getting dementia would probably feel more affected as they may feel that it\u2019s unfair that they have it so young when they have a lot of life left ahead of them, they also may not be able to deal with it very well as most people associate dementia with older people. Their life will change so much and sometimes so quickly, they may have to leave work, stop driving etc. Then they would have to think about the help they would need, finance etc. which with so much happening and changing can lead to a lot of stress and then to depression in a person and sometimes more. Having dementia as an older person is probably more easier to deal with than getting it as a younger person because you have experienced a lot and lived a life so you would be more acceptance of it and deal with it a lot better."
"Because [they] [had] each other, George and Lenny became more loving and compassionate, not just towards themselves, but also towards others (104). Unlike the other traveling workers who journeyed alone, George and Lenny were together, fighting off the hardships of The Great Depression with a loving relationship. This bond kept each others hearts pure and refrained them from turning bitter. Ever since Candys dog was a puppy, he and Candy had shared a trustworthy connection filled with loyalty for each other."
"The nursing agency refers to the characteristics of people who are trained as nurses that enable them to act, to know and to help others meet their therapeutic self-care demands by developing their own self-care agency. Nursing systems are created when nurses use their knowledge and skills to plan and implement nursing care where there are deficiencies in self-care. The aim of intervention by the nurse is to compensate for the self-care activities which the individual, family or community cannot maintain at an optimal level. These compensatory activities are classified into: * * *"
"Both of these reasons are thought to be the major drives behind the migration sensation. By 1939 there were 38,000 people of Italian Origin in Australia and by 1971 when the rush of migration had slowed greatly there were over 660, 000 people of Italian descent in Australia. But how did they get there? There were no planes and most people were much too poor to get on a proper boat. There was also the prospect of getting to the port. Many people would travel days by cart, train, bus or boat. Their very few belongings fitted into a small, solid wooden trunk. It normally involved a good luck charm such as a rosary and some photographs of their loved ones. They then had to board a rickety and unsafe boat, the conditions were cramped, food was poor and the journey took its toll on the young and the sick. The boat was advertised to be 5 star and many Italians believed this."
"The new A380 Airbus which can carry 550 passengers is expected to be in regular use by the end of 2007. According to Rolls-Royce, each engine of the Airbus uses as much power as 3,500 cars and so works out as 6 cars per passenger. It is predicted that in 20 years time there will be 1,500 of these aircraft strewn across the skies pumping out as much carbon dioxide as 5 million cars. (The Economist 2006)"
"The most exemplary figure of Phoebe Hawthorne\u2019s narrative art in his fiction. from beginning to end this character, the author reveal how his temperament can learn to read symbols, and from side to side this action, he also illustrate how his spectators will come to be grateful for his art fully. Hawthorne\u2019s symbol of women in his fiction is progressive: indeed,"
"Identity, Self Image and Self Esteem contribute to the overall well being in how individuals can express themselves, feel about themselves and are perceived by others. This will affect whether they feel happy and good about themselves on a day to day basis. Treat every individual with dignity and this will promote their self esteem and well-being."
"Afterward, she received a message around 1 am that the plan is unsure and her uncle will update her. At around 3 am her uncle texted Angela telling that the plan will be pushed through. The sun has risen, Angela was prepared to leave and was already waiting for them when suddenly, her uncle called telling her that the plans were changed. The family will leave the next day at around 2 am to avoid traffic and arrive there early. Angela was so confused and got pissed off. This is why it is important to be fixed and clear about the information the sender will transmit to the receiver."
"This is because, women who enter marriage in young age are more likely to be beaten or threatened by their husbands who would even justify their acts (Jensen & Thornton, 2003). As been stated by Bruce, Lloyd, and Leonard (1995), 40 to 80 percent of physical abuse experienced by women is done by the husband. This can also be called domestic violence, which is violence or other abuse by one person against another done in a domestic setting, such as in marriage or cohabitation. The statistic of domestic violence cases provided by the Women\u2019s Aid Organisation (WAO), shows that a total of 15,617 cases involving domestic violence reported in Malaysia between 2014 and 2017. Hence, this shows how crucial it is to raise the marriage age so that underage marriage and domestic violence can be avoided."
"My best friends have been there for me through everything. I don\u2019t know what I would do without them. I\u2019ve cared for friends, in return, they cared for me. I\u2019ve lost friends, but I\u2019ve gained the best friends I could ask for. I realize though that not everyone has friends like I do. I think if everyone were nice to one another as well as befriending others, we could all have best friends who make our lives wonderful, perhaps even more worth living. Just like my best friends have made my life."
"Shakespeare uses a lot of irony in Romeo and Juliet, to show the seriousness of their tragic love. Romeo and Juliet are a pair of star crossed lovers, whose destined journey of fatal and death marked love to is bound to go wrong and their deaths are the only thing that can restore the peace between Montagues and Capulets. Both families paid the cost of fighting by losing their only children, as the old saying goes \u2018Love\u2019s path doesn\u2019t run smoothly\u2019. I believe that everyone wants to share the love that Juliet and Romeo had for each other; this play mirrors the truth of reality and people\u2019s real inner truths about love. Shakespeare is only showing the truth about love. The tragedy is that both lovers kill themselves, which brings great sadness to both families. I truly believe in the love of \u2018 Juliet and her Romeo\u2019, for this sad tale of love is the base for any relationship today. My favourite line that ends the play beautiful and poetic \u2018For never was a story of more woe. Than this of Juliet and her Romeo\u2019."
"Global warming is an extremely severe problem facing the world today. Its effects and causes have been on the rise and people need to do something about it before the problem gets any worse. There are several ways to reduce the effects of global warming. The first way is you can choose vegetarian meals. Choosing vegetarian foods can be drastically reduces agricultural water consumption and land use, and favorably impacts biodiversity. Vegetarian diets also have been shown to promote good health and in most developed countries, eliminating meat from one\u2019s diet is as easy as making responsible choices at stores and restaurants."
"France is known to have the most relaxed dog policy all over the world. Cafes in Paris, not only allow dogs in but also offer them chairs at the table. Recently, the city Metro service lowered the fare tickets for larger dogs and small dogs travel free. For the small breeds, they must be caged or in a bag while bigger breeds should be leashed and muzzles on public transport."

"In one culture a hand signal can be a sign of peace, but in another country with another culture it can have a negative connotation that could even start a fight in most situations. A huge example of this is when President George H. W. Bush gave a \u201cpeace sign\u201d to a group of farmers in Canberra, Australia, not knowing that in Australia two fingers up to form a V is the equivalent of the middle finger in the US. This gesture has the same connotation in the UK and Ireland. And then there was President Nixon\u2019s visit to Brazil in the 50\u2019s, he applied the OK gesture with in Brazil is the equivalent of the finger in the US."
"In the article Economic stress and Domestic Violence by Claire M. Renzetti from the National Online Resource Center on Violence against Women, they bring social class and domestic violence into clear view. One discussion in the article which we have to take into account when looking at social class and domestic violence is ell put when she stats \u201cthe data we have about domestic violence comes from samples to which researchers have greatest access, such as individuals who use social services and these individuals are more likely to have low incomes\u201d (Renzetti, 2009)."
"The growth and power of the supermarkets is a controversial subject with those pro supermarkets heralding the growth as favourable by creating jobs, regenerating run down areas and bringing affluence to an area. The anti-supermarkets groups disagree stating a loss of smaller, individual shops, the emptiness of high streets and reduced choice for the consumer. There are benefits and losses to society by the growth of the supermarkets and some of these, can be more clearly seen than others."
"Between the two main characters, George is more intelligent, but to survive, he cares for and loves Lennie in all the ways that he can. George has foresight and creates back-up plans for Lennie if the situations turn sour, telling Lennie,\u201c Hide in the brush till I come for you. Can you remember that? \u201d (17). Lennie, on the other hand, keeps George hopeful and upbeat, motivating him by saying, \u201cCome on, George. Tell me. Please, George. Like you done before\u201d (14)."
"Senate Rand Paul, pro-gun advocate and a republican in Kentucky, \u201chas implied he will filibuster new proposals and has said to Obama, \u201cCall me if any of your reforms would\u2019ve saved those kids at Sandy Hook\u201d (Fetzer). He does not believe any new laws to be passed on gun control would prevent another tragedy, such as Sandy Hook. Cleta Mitchell, a Washington lawyer and director of the National Rifle Association, justifies the reason for gun control is due to the insane people who have had their chances to obtain guns, and using them in criminal behavior."
"There is also hormonal birth control offered in the form of pills, patches, injections, and vaginal rings. These are hormone releasing agents that prevent the egg from releasing in the ovaries. Implantation devices can be used as well, but are more of a permanent fixture for about 2-5 years. Depending on the device depends on how it prevents pregnancy. Some or hormonal, making the mucus lining thicker in the cervix to prevent sperm from entering. There is a copper device that releases copper into the uterus and kills sperm. Those are both intrauterine devices, but there is another that is implanted under the skin in the arm. It is hormone releasing and prevents sperm from reaching the egg and also thickens the mucus in the cervix preventing sperm to enter. There are other options, but they include sterilization and are more of an invasive surgery (Women\u2019s Health 2011)."
"Through his convincing tone and devilish persistence, Arnold friend is viewed by most literary critics as Satan himself, The story has been subject to differing interpretations by various critics. It has been seen as an inverted fairy tale in which Connie is joined not with Prince Charming but with the Prince of Darkness. These readers have pointed out similarities between Arnold Friend and the devil: his disguise, his supernatural knowledge of the whereabouts of Connie\u2019s family, his ability to lure Connie to him against her will, even his very name, which is by no coincidence close to \u201cArch Fiend. (Korb) When we take a look at the sinister character of \u201cFriend\u201d it easy to interpret him as the devil. Take out the \u201cr\u201d in Arnold Friend\u2019s name and you clearly discern what Arnold represents; an old Fiend. Connie was attracted to Friend\u2019s gold car, a color that is divine and often classified as the color of the gods. Before raping Connie, the satanic Friend inserts a boot in between Connie\u2019s front door, \u201cOne of his boots was strange at an angle, as if his foot wasn\u2019t in it\u201d (592)."
"To make the resolution a proper one in the eyes of the people, George tells him the dream, as it helps Lennie feel better, and as people say, dieing happy is like dieing a natural death deserved by someone who has been good to the community. Some might disagree, but if you look at the murder incident through Lennie\u2019s eyes, we can really see that Lennie didn\u2019t mean to do it, but he wanted to calm down Curley\u2019s wife, but accidentally killed her in the process."
"What would someone do if they had to choose between their family and someone they love? How would they make that choice? As a woman, they have responsibilities to their family, but they also have responsibilities to themselves and that is the love for someone other than a family member, but also woman are afraid of some changes. As a woman in 1904, they did not work so they had all of the housework and the family responsibilities, but they are also responsible for their own happiness and that is falling in love with someone; women have the choice some are just scared of making that big change."
"He went out of his way to help someone in need, at some cost to himself. Thomson illustrates the other extreme by using the case of Kitty Genovese, who was murdered while thirty-eight people stood by and did nothing to help. In this case the Good Samaritan would have rushed to her aid, putting his own life on the line in order to save a stranger\u2019s. While Thomson seems to say that this is too much to ask of people, and they are not morally required to risk their own life to save another\u2019s, she does say that the Minimally Decent Samaritan would have at least called the police."
"In the book \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d, by John Steinbeck, is a story which shows how friendship and loyalty can be the strongest thing in the world until it gets in the way, and begins to get overwhelming. It shows how people can turn on their family, best friend, and even their life-long companions if they have the opportunity for a better life. Steinbeck develops his theme by using relationships, events, outcomes, and conflicts throughout the story. This theme is established in many instances, when George and Lennie share the same dream and Lennie loves when George tells him how it is going to be when they finally own their own house, when candy allows his loyal and loving old dog to be shot in the back of the head, and when George gets angry with Lennie and yells at him when they are in the woods sitting around the camp fire."
"Villaruel, with the help of Chen, successfully broke the seals of secret\u00a0about the mysterious Bangalore. He made use of the ethnologist in him. It took him minutes to recover from what he had just discovered, that Bangalore, and all the stories connected to it were all real. Yes, it\u2019s where dead bodies of soldiers were buried whose hearts and brains were experimented."
"Literature is reviewed to define respect and what are desirable behaviors and moral values to be taught in schools and to point out the role teachers must play. The rest of the article discusses requirements for creating a respectful environment, especially the teacher\u2019s role. Before the teacher can create this environment and teach these values, he must examine his own beliefs and values. He must then know and understand a lot about other cultures and backgrounds."
"For any country to fully benefit from foreign labour, there must be several complementary policies. One is to recognize that not all foreign labour is or should be low skilled. This is recognized by some countries which have clear cut policies to attract and retain high skilled foreign labour, including through liberal migration policies."
"at a heightened level. Professional skepticism requires auditors \u201cneed to be alert to patterns and situations of material misstatement due to error or fraud, remain alert to internal control weaknesses that increase the risk of fraudulent activities, and management bias that increases the risk of fraudulent financial reporting. Al\u2019s lack of action caused Woody to steal a large amount of inventory. An audit staff would have been able to catch Woody in the act of theft if they acted with due care and used professional skepticism during the audit. 2. Goodner\u2019s had no true internal controls set up at the regional offices * The owners trusted employees because of background checks. * Insufficient control consciousness within the organization, for example, the tone at the top and the control environment. * Absent or inadequate segregation of duties within a significant account or process. Absent or inadequate controls over the safeguarding of assets (this applies to controls that the auditor determines would be necessary for effective internal control over financial reporting). * The absence of an internal process to report deficiencies in internal control to management on a timely basis. * Sales people were allowed to collect payments. * Sales people were allowed to deliver tires. 3. The best thing the Goodner\u2019s could have done would be to set up controls separate duties."
"First of all, one of the reasons of child marriage is to receive an exorbitant amount of money, which is called Toyana (wedding expenses) in Dari. The payment that parents \u00a0receive from the groom family is not less than 300,000 Afs. and is not meant to be the wedding expenses, but the price of their child daughter. In a report about the child \u00a0marriages \u00a0in \u00a0Afghanistan \u00a0by \u00a0the \u00a0Women \u00a0and \u00a0Children \u00a0Legal \u00a0Research \u00a0Foundation (WCLRF) shows that most of the interviewees have said that the only reason they were married in their childhoods was to receive Toyana from the groom\u2019s family (Earily Marriage in Afghanistan)."
"However if the child does something naughty they will get a \u2018yellow card\u2019 which is a warning if a child gets this card the child will lose their golden time on a Friday, if the child then is consistently naughty then they will have a red card where they get sent to the head teacher."
"All in all, even though there did existed nationalism between the Nation, it diminished though out the time and soon it was only a statement used to cover up division. At the end not even nationalism could save the country from sectionalism. As a result the Civil War broke out. This proved that the \u201cEra of Good Feelings\u201d was only a statement used by the United States to cover all the sectionalism that exited in the US."
"These were chosen because of the high amount of appeal these types of promotional methods would have on younger consumers. The places chosen to promote the RRoth were the Internet (Manufacturer\u2019s Website), Dealers, and Distributors. These options were chosen because of the accessibility to younger consumers, especially the Internet. The services chosen were training to dealers, customization options, and financial services. Training to dealers was chosen so that the dealers can provide detailed and accurate information about the products sold."
"Miss Jimenez states \u2018We need something that will attract the women voters, something more traditional and romantic'(Valdez 962). The depiction of Johnny humorously illustrates the common stereotype of Mexican Americans that live in cities during the late 1960\u2019s. The final stereotype that is depicted is the Revolucinario, an adventurous, bilingual college educated rancher, who is also a movie and television actor, Much like Governor Regan. Honest Sancho states \u2018As a matter of fact he is built like our Anglo models except that he comes in a variety of darker shades\u00a6\u2019 (Valdez 963). Honest Sancho continues \u2018Yes se\u0413\u00b1orita, this model represents the apex of American engineering'(Valdez 963)."
"The court stated that, because the former Loyalists resided in the United States, while the states were debating and ratifying the Constitution, they were qualified for citizenship. This and later decisions showed how, over time, the country exercised reason and consent to create citizenship \u2013 even allowing the original sin of fighting against the formation of the nation to be forgiven. It was vital to the founders that the probationary period be brief and apply identically to all undocumented immigrants, irrational of race, ethnicity and color. While the first Congress of the United States had to protect our fragile young democracy from monarchs and kings, and people from conservative regimes, today legislators fear that immigrants are taking American jobs and violating immigration procedures. Ultimately, the founders recognized that they needed to avoid re-creating the circumstances that led us to rebel against the British in the first place: taxation without representation. Many people are afraid that naturalizing undocumented immigrants as permanent workers who have lived here for years will conquer our immigration laws. We might learn from the example of our founders, who conquered a far greater fear when they gave citizenship to former Loyalists and created rules for naturalizing new immigrants. Selling legal status only to people who can afford high fees and legal expenses doesn\u2019t make our border-control and immigration laws stronger. It makes them unfair. When the issue of crossing the border from one nation to another country illegally came into the attention of the government, how can they not take action!"
"The NFL represents \u201cThe National Football League,\u201d which contains thirty-two professional American teams (\u201cNFL Football Teams,\u201d para 1). Over the past year to present time, there has been a lot of controversy within the league concerning a major political issue with select NFL players kneeling during the playing of the national anthem before kickoff. Kneeling is executed to represent a form of silent protest. The NFL players who are kneeling believe that there are prevailing issues in the United States that need to be brought to the public\u2019s attention."
"One particularly disturbing trend that a great deal of research reveals is that African American face a higher risk of dying from heart disease, stroke, diabetes, high blood pressure than any other racial group in the United States. This fact seems to transcend economic status as more affluent black Americans are just as much at risk. The question of course is why?"
"For your peers, you must be\u00a0technically and tactically proficient and set the standard for both of them to follow. And for your superiors, you must accomplish the mission quickly, efficiently and sometimes even in the absence of orders. These are just small examples of the many, many things that can help you earn the respect of your fellow soldiers. The key to remember is that you must do something other than just sit around. You must earn respect and work hard to gain it. Your rank or position deserves the military honors that are presented with it, but no more. The rest is up to us as soldiers and individuals. Through our own actions we can earn the respect of fellow soldiers, and through the actions of our fellow soldiers, they will earn our respect and all that goes with it."
"The other argument for death penalty is based on the understanding hat it eliminates villains and habitual killers from the society who would otherwise continue to harass people. The proponents argue hat when a criminal is executed he no longer poses any threat. This follows the logical argument that the execution of killers and other radical offenders would contribute to safer societies, Banner (2002, p.60)."
"The author is still trying to convince himself that his mother is not dead in the last verse by writing \u2018O you are not lying in the wet clay\u2019. It gives the impression also that he is trying to make himself feel better by using the previous line that I have discussed??? (DOESN\u2019T MAKE SENSE)"
"The first example is \u2018I found that I had no strength\u2019. He said that after saying \u2018when loose rocks slipped suddenly under my feet, I found that I had no strength\u2019. So what the reader should understand here is that he was so tired that when the rocks under him slipped, and he was too tired to do anything about it. He didn\u2019t mean the literal meaning of having no strength. Another example of hyperbole and that was at the end of the text and that I really liked. \u2018There seemed no end\u2019. He meant that he drank a lot since he was so thirsty, he felt that he was drinking forever. I wrote a lot about figurative language but I wanted to talk about most of them. Connotative phrases, it was like most of the ones I talked about was presented twice or more. One example was \u2018tantalizing slowness\u2019, \u2018I crouched at the rock drinking and waiting, and drinking again\u2019."
"As Crooks, perhaps the novel\u2019s most solitary character because of his black skin puts it, \u201cA guy needs somebody\u2014to be near him.\u201d (Steinbeck, 1965:82) All the characters in the novel long for friendship and kindness but yet they all live in fear of one\u00a0another. This is shown with the tough shooting of Candy\u2019s dog which makes it clear that during the Great Depression if you are useless, old or weak you will certainly be destroyed because the strong and the useful will fight for survival. All the workers on the ranch would constantly try to make themselves look strong especially if they feeling weak. The fear of the weak being overrun by the strong could explain why Curley likes to fight a larger men then he is \u201cCurley\u2019s pretty handy. He done quite a bit in the ring. He\u2019s a light weight and he\u2019s handy\u201d (Steinbeck, 1965:29) and it could also be why Crooks tells Lennie that George is going to abandon him. Then Curley\u2019s wife threatens to have Crooks lynched. Each of these characters tries to appear strong by asserting power over one another. This fear of being the strongest explains why the other characters in novel find it hard to understand George and Lennie\u2019s friendship because they see being the strongest as a fight for survival."
"It adheres to the needs of its employees by creating partner contact centers for the main purpose of the partners and giving them a place to go for whatever reason and creating outside avenues. Starbucks listens and answers questions when asked by partners, making them feel as though they have a voice. Programs such as tuition reimbursement, health care for part time employees and same sex partners has pushed Starbucks to the forefront and decreases turnovers within the company."
"Bourgois conducts his research for this book by putting himself in direct daily contact with the subjects of this book. Through participant observation, he was able to delve deep into the personal lives of the crack dealers, addicts, and people effected by the epidemic. He also attended holidays and family function in order to get a more humanistic and holistic view of this society."
"Sophie violates her mother\u2019s notion of being pure because she wants to break free from Martine. She likens herself to the woman who would not stop bleeding when she says, \u201cIf she wanted to stop bleeding, she would have to give up her right to be a human being\u201d (87), in which Sophie herself would have to break her hymen in order to \u201cbreak free\u201d from her mother\u2019s clutches. The night that she took the pestle to bed with her, though she knew it was \u201cnot good for her hymen to tear apart like so, she had felt that \u201cthere was no longer any reason for me to live\u201d (87), because her mother had been doing this horrible thing of testing her. If she could be free from her mother and her testing, she would consequently be free from her mother\u2019s past because she, too, had been tested. The pestle acts as a mechanism for Sophie to free herself from her mother."
"The Brownies description of troop 909 \u201cThey were white women, their skin tones a blend of ice cream: strawberry, vanilla in the very first few lines it is extremely clear that racial concerns and partition is a primary topic. The author ZZ Packer did a fantastic task stating given that the beginning that the stories was going to be confrontational \u201cTroop 909 was doomed from the very first day of camp;\u201d Segregation is likewise still occurring throughout this time since there is no diversity in the members of the each troop, one is all African American and the other is all Caucasian ladies."
"Second, mental and physical health risks are associated with abortions. A patient may experience hemorrhaging, infection, or death. The most common risk of getting an abortion is breast cancer. During a woman\u2019s first pregnancy, the breast structure is permanently changed. It seems apparent that cancerous changes occur more frequently among these transitional cells of a woman who has terminated her pregnancy."
"He begins considering things, asking questions, and doing things he never would have without Jane coming into his life; the once quiet and reserved Will who had avoided love found himself wanting her, feeling vulnerable, and taking risks like obtaining a fake ID to go to clubs and stag shops."
"The movie starts out through the eyes of Danny Vinyard, who idolizes his older brother Derek. Derek is seeking revenge for his father\u2019s murder and burning a way to vent his rage. His father was a firefighter who was on duty one night putting out a fire at a crack house. His father was shot and killed by black drug addicts while fighting a fire in a crack house in a black neighborhood. He blames all black people for the death of his father. Derek hates anyone who is not a white protestant. Later it is learned that it wasn\u2019t just his father\u2019s death that shaped him, but his father\u2019s conversation at the dinner table one night about racism."
"A trainee was diagnosed with depression about a year ago. She did not tell you until three months ago, when she confided in you about what she was experiencing and the treatment she was getting from her doctor and therapist. A month ago, the learner was signed off on sick leave. She returned to work last week but is overwhelmed."
"The use of drama classes in the curriculum for children with special needs is sometimes automatically equated with drama therapy. Such an assumption may arise from the mistaken thought that if a child has some kind of learning disability, the only type of drama of any benefit for them must be designed to help them with their particular individual need. Drama therapy, is a developing technique to the treatment and education of special groups based on the work of J.L. Moreno.Some children with special needs might benefit from the approach, it is not to be assumed that every child needs drama therapy .Monitored work in drama therapy is therapeutic\u2019."
"This requirement exemplifies a citizenship test that clearly does not fit an accommodating multicultural model of integration, as it will significantly disadvantage lower-income migrants. Joppke concludes his analysis of the Dutch citizenship test by stating that, \u201cwhat began as an immigrant integration policy has thus turned into its opposite, a no-immigration policy\u201d (Joppke, 2007: 8)."
"On the next figure, scene of little Lat being chased by his mother due to his stubbornness, and it was drawn beautifully and humorously chasing scene. The elder woman was pictured in the drawing fetching water from well is surprised when little Lat were running around her try to get escape from her mother. Once again we can identify traditional Malay village culture element which is water supply taken from well, chickens as source of poultry and eggs, open type of housing environment (without any fence), and high built houses off the ground in order to avoid floods."
"In 1860 the average American believed that they were living the happiest and luckiest a person could be. They were generally living better than their fathers, and looked forward to their children prospering more than themselves. However, at the time America had developed into two very different societies between the North and the South. These changing societies were beginning to adjust to the start of the industrial revolution in separate ways."
"He aint got no friends to say \u201d hello \u201d too all because of the colour of hes skin. The white boys always pick him on. And even thought it aint hes fault most of the things are blamed on him. Also when the boss is feeling really mad he takes it all out on crooks and crooks just gets shouted at for no reason at all. Crooks on the hireachy he is right at the bottom and hes got no power at all. Even thought he has been one of the people who has been working there the longest and he has been loyal to boss."
"More settlement houses were established and used as centers for activism and social reform. In 1893, the Hull House successfully lobbied for an Illinois anti-sweatshop law to protect women workers and prohibit child labor. Urbanization after the Civil War helped to reawaken the Social Reform movements in America. Urbanization helped the United States of America rebound after the Civil War. The Population boom, growing education, and social reforms were all beneficial results that changed the nation."

"The Common Man in the play is actually an alienation device, which was first invented by Bertolt Brecht. Here, the Common Man is an effective device to maintain interest, interpret the action and convey the themes. He just like the Chorus in ancient Greek drama, whose role was to review the action, explores motivations and issues, foretell what might happen and explore any consequences. Both the Common Man and the Chorus relate the play to audience\u2019s everyday life and their frame of reference in modern society. He is the linkage between the audiences and the stage. Just like how he is called, the Common Man, has all the characteristics ordinary people does. He has ordinary morals, ordinary doubts and ordinary concerns, which means he is always ready to compromise, distrustful of martyrdom and plays things low. He is the \u201cOld Adam\u201d, he is \u201cus all\u201d."
"How does Steinbeck present loneliness in \u2018of mice and men\u2019? During the Great Depression in the 1930s in the USA many migrant workers went to California in search of work. In the novel \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d John Steinbeck deals with the loneliness which affected these characters. One of the main symbols of this, is the setting of the novel is in Soledad, which translated from Spanish means solitude. Steinbeck point to the cause of loneliness being from discrimination, and the loneliest person on the working ranch would likely be the black stable buck \u201cCrooks\u201d, this is proved by his actions and his attempts to make friends."
"bring greater problems to child behavior. When children are however removed from their homes they could be in a state of impermanence or transience without being in a stable family. Children\u2019s well being and health should not be compromised in extended family relationships and the government\u2019s role is important in defining the vulnerability of children\u2019s lives. Children are prevented from ill-treating their parents and this is done by placing them with carers also as Berrick argues these carers may not meet the qualifications for providing adequate care. However the primary mission of children would be an emphasis on protecting children who have been harmed by parents."
"In between each scene there was also a vocal piece relevant to the scene which had just been and the next scene to come, almost a live update on the present situation. The scene changes need to be slick otherwise you would lose interest in the play and the flow of it would lose its impact on the audience, be very disjointed and wouldn\u2019t make sense."
"Many people are supporting the higher education of illegal immigrant children. According to Rosa Ramirez, \u201ca student at Miami-Dade College was classified as an out-of-state student because she could not provide the legal status of her parent.\u201d In the case, it is said that the student was born in Florida and that she had graduated high school in the state. The university\u2019s rule was making her pay a lot more because of her parents\u2019 status. It should not matter where her parents stand, what really matters is a person\u2019s motivation to get a good education. By making her pay extra, she had another obstacle to face before she could go to college. If she did not speak up, she would have lost the chance to continue getting a higher education. Luckily a Florida judge ruled that making her pay out-of-state tuition \u201cviolates the equal protection of the laws guaranteed under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.\u201d More and more cases like this are being won by children of illegal immigrants. This shows that people are opening up their eyes to the importance of education for everyone and that if someone is willing to put in effort to get an education, then they deserve it."
"Developing a diversity training program for your organization typically involves assessing your team\u2019s needs, designing materials that reflect your training requirements, delivering workshops and reference materials and evaluating your efforts. Companies that implement diversity training programs to advocate workplace diversity tend to have higher employee retention rates, improved morale, reduced lawsuits and improved recruiting. Step 1"
"I had a chat with mum and told her what her daughter had told me and suggested she had arrived at that age where she wants more privacy when getting changed. Mum said she had not been told and would have done something about it had she known it was upsetting her daughter. She also explained how busy the family are on a morning and maybe did not listen as she would normally. The family playstation is located in her daughter\u2019s room and all the children in the family will go into that room to play on it. Mum told me she would have a word with the boys in the house."
"Something troubling pulls at the edge of my mind, but I ignore it. A wave rolls up to the beach, crashing around me, wetting me hot body. I dig my body into the moistened ground, covering my legs and arms with the cool, wet sand. I hear my mom calling to me to come up to the umbrella. I turn back to look at her, as I do so the little thing at the edge of my mind suddenly dawns on me. I made it out to the water, now I must make my way back."
"The Southerners viewed this as a threat to slavery and established their own counter movement. Initially, the Border Ruffians won the election and drafted a pro-slavery constitution for the territory of Kansas. In response, Free-Staters drafted the Topeka constitution and formed a shadow government.

"In many ways race is about difference and how those differences are codified through language, categories, boxes, segmentation, and even the implicit sorting that goes on in our heads in terms of the way we label others and even ourselves. I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge who you are and everything that makes you that. The race has become a big problem today due to the recent changes. Me being black has not been a problem until these changes occurred. I am looked at more differently than I normally am. When I go in store, they ask me to check my bag. However, I notice that the people behind and in front of me don\u2019t get asked the same. In addition, on public transportation people tend to avoid seating next time, and even when it\u2019s coward it they prefer to stand up. I have come to an understanding no matter what my race is going bring a kind of discomfort towards people. All I can do is be proud of who I am. (TCO 5)."
"According to Ms. Mao, the family structure of the Chinese people is a strength as well as a weakness in terms of having personal space. New learning\u2019s regarding this fact includes an appreciation of the Chinese family unit and the fact that the traditional relationships in the Chinese nuclear family unit extend far beyond the home. Research has shown that, \u201cIt is common for several generations to live together under one roof. After marriage, a woman traditionally leaves her parents\u2019 home and becomes part of her husband\u2019s family (www.everyculture.com, 2013). Although Ms. Mao never hinted that this was her particular plan to start a family, she did imply that she greatly respected Chinese family tradition. VI.

"When an offer is made by the defendant, he should not retract the offer. As he knows that the bidding means he willing to buy at that price he should keep his word and pay the price he bid for. In Islam a person should not say anything which he will not be able to keep his word against. Whatever man says he should do so."
"\u20193 Their friendship and common idealism acts like a thread that ties and unites Ramatoulaye and Aissatou together. Throughout chapters one to sixteen, the intimacy between them is evident. After they got married they would meet on the beach and \u2018depression and sadness would disappear, suddenly to be replaced by feelings of plentitude and expansiveness.\u20194"
"Explanation for this can be found in the international division of labour (IDL) that has occurred, in which agriculture and manufacturing have moved abroad to areas that have a comparative advantage over the UK in these sectors. Bryson (2008) referred to this process as the first global shift. The result is, as Figure 1 shows, that as agriculture and manufacturing decline in the UK, services \u2018fill the gap\u2019 that they have left behind. But what led to the first global shift?"
"Lastly, Nan is one of the most influential family members in Sally\u2019s life. Sally did not know why her dad dislike Nan at first but it all becomes clear at the end when she knows that Nan is aboriginal. Nan has a habit that Sally dislike, being afraid of people in power. Due to that, Sally became strong and independent when it comes to dealing with people with power as shown through in chapter 18 as she was suspected guilty for receiving an aboriginal scholarship but not actually one. The fact that Nan and mum mentioned about being \u2018black\u2019 is a bad thing and being \u2018white\u2019 is everything encourages Sally to stand up and proof that being aboriginal is not something to be ashamed of, she is proud to be one because that\u2019s what makes her who she is."

"If countries are serious about stemming its alarming brain drain, it must provide better job opportunities that properly remunerate workers based on their skills and talents.

"The answer to this question is, guns don\u2019t kill people, people kill people; however, guns make it easier to kill people and often time in great numbers. The government should create stricter laws on gun control and end the senseless mass murders at the hands of individuals in possession of guns. In the United States, it is way too easy to obtain a gun, and with that said, guns end up in the wrong hands. The way to control guns is to make it harder to obtain a gun, lowering the number of deaths caused by guns."
"The law stipulates that the death penalty must exist, so there must have a rationale for it. Deprivation of a person\u2019s right to life does not seem to be in conformity with the constitutional systems of today\u2019s countries, but from the constitutional point of view, the right to life is not an absolute right, it is a relative right that can be restricted in accordance with the provisions of the law."

"Consumerist is a social and economic order that encourages the purchase of goods and services in ever greater amounts. In the American consumption, people do not know how much is enough, do we really need all we buy? Or we just buy it because everyone else has it? Does it make us any happier?

Her aim is clear to thinking for some academic space about these terms women, men and politeness. Women, men and language research cannot continue to discuss gender simply in terms of the linguistic gap behavior of women and men except in particular situation and with particular goals. The study argues that we need several analytical changes: firstly, we need to see politeness as occurring over longer-stretches of talk; secondly, it should be seen within the background of a community practice, rather than as simply as the product of individual speakers, and finally, we need to be aware that there may be conflicts over the meanings of politeness. In this essay I shall discuss that women men politeness agreeable and disagreeable (Holmes, 2006)."
"Explore the idea of racial prejudice and discrimination by writing about Cassie\u2019s visit to Strawberry with Big Ma. Show how the ideas are brought out powerfully because of Cassie\u2019s age and character? The novel \u2018Roll of thunder, hear my cry\u2019 is set in the 1930\u2019s in Mississippi. The author, Mildrid D. Taylor can relate to the Logan family as she is writing about her father, whose character in the book is Little man."
"Language is neither a problem as well. The Philippine Constitution has granted the English language as co-official with Filipino. Moreover, many schools from elementary to college level in the Philippines use English as their primary language of instruction. The colonization of the US of the Philippines has somehow helped in the easier Filipino American assimilation of the present generation. Though many of them are proud of their Filipino roots, since they are already accustomed to American culture back in the Philippines, it has become easier for them to adjust to new environment."
"The canteen staff make sure to cater to the needs of every child, for example they make gluten-free meals for children with celiac disease and have a vegetarian option for those who chose not to eat meat or can\u2019t eat meat. The canteen staff also make sure they do not use any ingredients that might trigger an allergic reaction in any of the children, such as nuts and eggs to ensure all children no matter what their dietary requirements can eat what they want. The children are given some choices about their school uniform options. The girls are allowed to choose whether they wear trousers or skirts. This has a positive impact as the girls may feel more comfortable wearing trousers. It gives them a sense of autonomy in their lives and respects their individual choices. As a result, they may feel happier in the setting as their wishes are being respected. It will also boost their self-esteem. The children in the school setting have the right to feel safe secure."
"This point leads onto McGough\u2019s views on teacher/pupil relationships. The poet implies that there is very little respect for the teacher as the children carry on talking and he is \u2018ignored\u2019. Throughout the rest of the poem we see the teacher carry out his anger on his class, even the headmaster joins in, someone who is seen as having a high authority and someone who must care for the children to the best ability he can. The third view we see the poet has is that schools are potentially threatening environments."
"An agreement about racism exists among criminal justice administrators, policymakers, and academics. The conclusion that racial discrimination is proven to be in the justice system certainly does not follow from the research on the subject. But a majority of scholars would certainly agree that there is a substantial body of evidence proving that racial bias inheres in certain practices and policies of both the criminal justice and juvenile justice systems."
"These integral ingredients of a classic are the vivid descriptions of the physical aspects of the story \u2013 the characters and setting, an entertaining and eventful plot, and the lasting truths the story\u2019s themes express. The most vivid memories of this story come from the striking descriptions of the physical aspects of the story. Mark Twain immediately brings the story to life with his introduction of the characters and their surroundings."
"Why can men do as they please with their body but not women? Women have the right to treat their body anyway they want if it does not affect any other person. In this case, a fetus is can not be counted as a separate human being due to being inside the mother\u2019s body. In 2019, Alabama passed an abortion law known as Alabama Human Life Act. This act made abortion almost impossible for women in Alabama. Yes, abortion is still legal in the state, but this act can make any doctor or person who performs an abortion get a Class A felony and get a jail time of 20 years. All the events that lead up to women having their freedom such as Roe v. Wade can not be taken in vain. Federal judge Myron Thompson did his part when trying to halt this Act on Oct 29, 2019, but unfortunately was overruled (Berry 2019)."
"Scannel tries to make the audience picture the child\u2019s friends as animals hunting for the place he has hidden. Scannel proves this by describing their movement by the word \u2018prowling\u2019, showing how the seekers moved, as if to hunt the child like an animal. The poet also uses personification to create space between the hider and the seekers, by showing quiet and emptiness. The two phrases,\u2019\u2026 darkening garden watches\u2026 \u2018 and \u2018\u2026 bushes held their breath\u2026 \u2018 show that the child had no audience apart from the garden in front of him."
"I am a part of a large family \u2013 eight children- with a limited income. I live on a family ranch 40 miles out of town and my parents don\u2019t have the income to pay me or pay my gas to drive into town to get a job. I was afraid that attending a university would be out of my financial reach. I was not even sure where the money was going to come from, but after research and discovering about scholarships, I realized college is possible. I now know that I can do whatever I choose; I just have to take action to obtain my goals."
"A lot of factors contribute towards infant mortality such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), accidents respiratory issues to say the least. However, the major problem is funding. The little that is set aside on many African countries budget towards healthcare is stolen by some corrupt government officials, Hanson, (2009). Research shows that midwives in Africa trained or untrained attend to about 9/10 of births. Thomas, (2009)."
"Oftentimes, it refers to a first or 2nd generation Mexican American living in an urban, Mexican American immigrant community, where there exists the strong ethnic awareness of being \u201cMexican American\u201d. It is considered a regard to ethnic pride, though not all Mexican Americans pleased with their heritage necessarily consider themselves Chicano. A lady of this category is generally called by the womanly kind Chicana, and, following the usual conventions for Spanish words, the masculine plural form Chicanos is used for groups that include both genders."
"And for those people that considering their goals directly , are more feel happier than to those people that thinking a many conflicts in their life are less happier. The one factors that cause a person to feel happy by his perception. If the person known his inner core and it os aware of his ability /power,he can overcome his problems and develop himself and persue his own abilities Abedi,(2004)."

"When Noah was playing in the sand, he pretended to scoop an ice-cream for his friend he knew exactly how to scoop the sand to make the correct rounded shape. This symbolic play would suggest he had seen this previously in his physical or social environment. Decontextualization of action occurred where Noah used the sand as it was ice-cream which was out of context. Decentration also occurred as he used the sand and made the shape of ice-cream to give to his friend. According to Stagnitti and Cooper \u201cDecentration\u201d is the ability to play on another object other than the person (Stagnitti & Cooper, 2009). It is through decentration a child learns the ability to understand the perspective of others (Stagnitti & Cooper, 2009)."
"If we are talking about the duration of the marriage and what makes it eternal, I think that family happiness begins with a woman. A man also has his own role, his work to strengthen relationships and create happiness in the kin. But since it is quite difficult to encourage others to make changes or to do something, and to teach and change ourselves is much easier, we begin to build personal and family happiness with ourselves. Nevertheless, the woman is the main force in preserving the kin."
"Respect can be defined as a positive feeling of esteem for a person or entity. It denotes the regard and consideration shown by an individual towards others. Respect cannot be demanded, it is an asset that has to be earned. From the very childhood kids are taught to respect their parents, elders, teachers and an unending list of social obligations."
"Nowadays the case of underage marriage in Malaysia is increasing with the statistic of 15,000 child marriage recorded these past years (Yeoh, 2018). This is a crucial matter because child marriage could give a huge impact on the adolescent. This lead to a question of whether Malaysia has a marriage age set in its law. Marriage age is defined as the minimum age requirement that allowed by the law, either as a right or subject to parental, judicial or other forms of approval for people to get married."
"David Von Drehle presented many accounts of evidence of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory disaster. In his book, he included newspaper editorials, such as The New York Times, Jewish Daily Forward, and New York World.\u00a0Newspapers during the early twentieth century were in danger of yellow journalism which loses much creditability. Journalists tended to exaggerate the news only to make front headline cover news."
"6. CLOTHING: Bark cloth is the main source of clothing for the pygmies (Turnbull, 130). The cloth is stripped from the trees as bark and pounded until smooth. It is dyed different colors using other plants and flowers. Depending on the type of bark used will determine the final color. The women leave a long \u201ctail\u201d hanging down in back because it looks nice while dancing."
"According to Peter Singer (1995), \u201cethical absolutism argues that there exists an eternal and unchanging moral law, the same for all people, at all times and places. The absolutist believes that certain moral principles apply to all people everywhere, and that people can recognize or discover these principles and be guided by them in deciding the nature of their own conduct and in judging the conduct of others\u201d(Singer, 1995). The reason why this theory was selected is because there high probability that the males commit these types of heinous acts because of past experiences of exposure to extreme violence or some traumatic psychological occurrences in the past. The past experiences which formed their conduct led them to believe that the way to treat women is the same way they witnessed the male figure in their family treating a woman. Researchers still have not found no explanation as to why displaying\u00a0disrespect in front of children and others comes as natural behavior."
"Kant had a thought-provoking way of explaining themself. He described it as dumping a puzzle out and it not having meaning until all the pieces are put together to him that\u2019s how the mind works. Our minds gather information and sort it based on significance. He talked about prior meaning was of organizing and relating the world.\u201d (Chaffee, 2016). \u201cKant backs that the dependence of self-consciousness on consciousness by arguing that the temporal succession of any conscious awareness cannot just consist in the consciousness of one\u2019s representation after another.\u201d (Winfield, 2006). It\u2019s our self that performs and arranges our experience in a way that known and recognizable by significance. Yourself is not like other objects located in your consciousness, self is a subject, an organizing principle that makes an incorporated and unmistakable experience feasible."
"But that\u2019s all there is about Salem she can\u2019t do anything else than bring this staff up which will cause friction. As a result, all we get from the first line is that she doesn\u2019t want to talk or discuss anything that is about Salem or staff that will cause tension but she feels she must too because that\u2019s all there is."
"According to Erikson, an identity crisis is a time of intensive analysis and exploration of different ways of looking at oneself. Identity basically refers to how a person answers the question \u201cWho am I?\u201d S. Sharma and M. Sharma said \u201cIdentity is an umbrella term used throughout the social sciences to describe an individual\u2019s comprehension of him or herself as a discrete, separate entity. The development of clear and positive identity or identities involves building self-esteem, facilitating the exploration of and commitment to self-definition, reducing self-discrepancies, and fostering role formation and achievement."
"The Aboriginal people had their culture stripped away, without any consent but by force. They were forced to \u201cadapt\u201c their lifestyle to the \u201cnormal,\u201c and children put into schools to learn how to behave like the Canadians. The Aboriginal residential schools implemented by the Canadian Government were a cause attempting to destroy their culture (Ravelli & Webber, 2010, p.132). The Canadian Government wanted to get rid of all aboriginal culture with no trace of their lifestyle. There was a massive social problem due to the separation of the races."
"Secondly, their mother pretends she is not hungry in order for her boys to have enough to eat. This is shown when Michael states, \u201cShe quickly reheated and served what remained of yesterday\u2019s lentil stew, and when Francis said, \u2018You\u2019re hardly leaving any for yourself,\u2019 she claimed she wasn\u2019t hungry\u201d (119)."
"White racists are also characterized by little or no human feelings at all and are deterrent to efforts aimed at combating segregation. Such an account shares similarity with various examples of intergroup animosity. For instance, the foundation of anti-Semitism is the hatred expressed against Jews. Therefore, activists who advocate for the interests of Israel consider anti-Semites as \u2018Jewish haters\u2019. Additionally, the doctrines attributed to scientists on race anthropology and biology are not factually wrong but encouraged and rationalized antipathy."
"In the Social-Emotional Development, every child is unique and has his own temperament and personality. As the child interacts with his social environment and culture, the people around him, the child would make sense of his world and develop his worldview towards people. A responsible and responsive parent or caregiver also would contribute to a child\u2019s positive development. JJs exhibits many episodes of screaming, bawling, hitting, crying and other outbursts of tantrum. This may be due to JJ\u2019s mom who has often use time-out to curb his misbehaviour. She seems to be drained, out of control and stressed in managing the household. Her low mood and negative and intense emotions may have impacted JJ in a negative way, as children of angry parents tends to be more aggressive and noncompliant. JJ learns to react whenever he is upset. Even when his siblings are playing by themselves besides him and have not disturbed him, he also chooses to hit out at them. What we see is JJ displaying intense anger and outburst in great frequency."
"I believe that I have always had a deep connection to Amen. One day, while I was performing a ritual, I had a vision from him. After that, I said, \u201cI acted under his command; it was he who led me. I did not plan a work without his doing. It was he who gave directions.\u201d I owe all of my success to him."
"But still, we must believe that everything that happened is the best possible thing that can be happen, because \u201ceverything comes at the appointed time. \u201d We just need to wait, and when the appointed time came, we must welcome it and believe that what will happen, will lead us to happiness. One exercise to welcome happiness is to smile. Thich Nhat Hanh states, \u201cIf you really know how to live, what better way to start the day than with a smile? Smiling helps you approach the day with gentleness and understanding."
"Some people prefer male friends and some prefer female friends. The difference between the two in my opinion are as stated; a male can be there to give you solutions from a male point of view and his experience about a female from what he has encountered through life. A female is more sensitive to anything that comes up. She is there to let you know how to handle a situation the right way without holding back on the feelings."
"It is most natural state of man and therefore the state in which you can are most likely to find solid happiness\u201d. Through those sentences, Franklin seems to estimate that from a masculine\u2019 view, one of the main advantages of the marriage is to bring pacification toward requirements of the flesh. The recipient of the letter who was the friend of the author seemed to be looking for a situation in which he could find sexual partner and happiness without commitment."
"Your childhood makes you who you are and it can either make you or break you. Stronger people don\u2019t let it break you. Jeannette and her siblings did just that, they decided they shouldn\u2019t be\u00a0treated or raised the way that they were so they did something about it and they made a life for themselves. Jeannette\u2019s childhood will always be apart of her and haunt her. Childhood is something a person doesn\u2019t forget. The actions of Rex and Mary Walls made Jeannette into who she is today because one day she decided not to let her selfish parents give her an unhappy life anymore and she did something for her and her siblings and that was getting away from Welch and not letting her parents take advantage of them any longer."
"The most common misconception about illegal immigration, is that immigration in general is not wanted at all. There is an extensive difference between being smuggled into the country, whether it be by boat, tunnel, or air travel versus applying for a visa and obtaining your citizenship. Opinions surrounding illegal aliens coming into our country are both good and bad."
"Our right to choose is limited by the rights of other people. For example, if this \u2018right to choose\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd were applied to another situation it would not be appropriate; very few people would say that an employer has the right to employ someone on the basis of their gender or the colour of their skin. Also, the woman is not the only one affected by an abortion, family members and the father in particular are greatly affected."
"It decrease 43.8% from 1981 to 2017. To do that, I have (13.5-29.3)/ (2017-1981), so I know how much reduce over that time. When it is decrease, it is new thing very happy because many children will see their parents. To conclude, average rate of change make the data of abortion more clearly and prevent the bad situation come to the girls or woman."
"Chapter nine is called \u201cDon\u2019t Dictate, Communicate,\u201d and talks about how financial happiness is a huge influence in the happiness of a marriage. I learned that communication of dreams, goals and plans is how marriages thrive or die. In fact, this chapter taught me that the lack of financial communication is one of the most common causes of divorce. Divorce because of finances miscommunication can be avoided by sitting down and talking through all the financial problems and solutions together as team. Another factor of financial happiness I learned from this chapter is being able to share your earnings without hesitation, but also to see recognize the red flag if your partner does not do the same. Marriage is a complicated subject and becomes more complex with finances in the mixture but the couples and still achieve financial happiness if they love and talk with the other about all financial situation."
"There are a wide range of effects for a person missing an appointment. Missing an appointment effect the individual who missed the appointment, least of all. Regardless of reason, not showing up for a scheduled time is a great disrespect to all the people that might have benefited from the scheduled time. Missing an appointment punishes others that may have gained from that time slot. There are many solutions to not missing an appointment, and by following the steps to prevent from missing an appointment gives a common courtesy to others."
"o \u201cThe Senate was regarded as the central institution of the Roman state\u201d (Beard and Crawford). o However during this period they did not live up to this duty to direct the Roman state. o Rather corrupt and after supremacy of the whole empire, using and manipulating certain power individuals in the form of PO, by breaking the constitution to achieve these means o It rejected and punished Caesar continually when he simply wanted equality to reach the same heights as PO."
"I lived with my grandparents. Since my parents were divorced when I was 2. After my mother moved to Switzerland my grandparents\u2019 place become more of a house than elsewhere. When I grew up, I had my own apartment for a few years, but, before moving to Kingston for school. I moved in with my grandma for a few months to help her renovate her house while I worked fully."
"It wasn\u2019t until after 4th grade that I moved to a new neighborhood and didn\u2019t see him again until 8th grade. We saw each other and recognized one another and again we became inseparable. We had a few classes together and we were always partners whenever we were assigned to grab a partner. Also that same school year, all the rumors started; that we liked each other, we were going to end up going out, we were always together and so on."
"Hamartia is what causes the tragic hero to do the opposite of what he intends to do. In case of Oedipus it is his flaw of character or ignorant error that can be said to have led to his downfall. It can be argued that it is not hamartia alone that led to Oedipus\u2019 downfall, the elements of fate, and free will also are ones to be considered but the fact remains that it is the fatal flaw or fatal error or hasty judgement of the character or characters involved that triggers off a set of tragic sequences predestined or not which ultimately lead to a tragic end, and this remains relevant in case of Oedipus Rex."
"Others assert that this is just one way through which they socialize with their peers. (Whyte, 1943) Conclusion Gang violence has existed since time immemorial. Surveys carried out in United States show that gang violence was there as early as 1200 AD. In the 1920\u2019s and 1930s, there were violence gangs that flogged the American streets. The trend continued to increase until the nineteenth century when youth involvement in this vice went overboard. Surveys reveal that youths get involved in gang violence for various reasons."
"In other words, Antigone cares more about being valued in the eyes of the divine law more than her sister showing loyalty to her family. As for Creon, the law of the state takes precedence over Antigone which is apparent when he tells Haimon, \u201cWe keep the laws then, and the lawmakers, and no woman shall seduce us\u201d (Scene 3, 49-50). Essentially, he would rather allow his niece to die than to change the \u201claws\u201d and \u201clawmakers\u201d of the state, as this would ultimately preserve his position as king. In reality, the politics that comes along with laws have the power to break apart families. Opposing political views within families can easily cause the pillar of loyalty to crumble because for most people, one\u2019s view of the law does take precedence over family ties, especially when considering the modern political world we live in."
"Propaganda has been coursing through the United States of America since the country\u2019s beginning. Propaganda is biased or deceptive information meant to endorse a certain view and can take many forms (Bergstrom). In the first years of the British colonization, propaganda could be seen in the form of John Cotton\u2019s sermon \u201cThe Divine Right to Occupy the Land,\u201d which assured the colonists that they were sent there from God and had the right to take over the land. In later years, propaganda could be seen taking the famous form of Benjamin Franklin\u2019s political cartoon \u201cJoin or Die."
"Earlier in the article Critser stated that \u201ckids don\u2019t know when they are full\u201d (1). Another weakness that Critser wrote was when he mocked the experts saying that kids have the right to make bad nutritional choices. This doesn\u2019t have much support in his paper or evidence along with Critser is comparing two different eras. \u201cNutrition, Health, and Schoolchildren\u201d written by Judy Butriss states alternative dietary suggestions whether it refers to healthy snacks to the decrease of food intake in a child. the dietary suggestions include; A balanced, varied diet for the whole family, avoiding grazing and TV snacks, healthy snacks (fruits) as alternatives to sweets, chocolate, biscuits, whole food that take time to eat, and grill or boil food instead of frying\u201d (Butriss 294). Finally, in Critser\u2019s article he uses loaded language and unfair argumentation with words like gluttony, foot soldiers, and infantry. Critser uses the term foot soldiers in a way against obesity that we are pushing for obesity and not seem to care as much. In a way that foot soldiers can be like foot soldiers that just are taught to march and march and nothing else."
"It is a global priority that animals especially endangered ones are lawfully protected from illegal trafficking whether for the purpose of medicine, resource of food, entertainment, or other uses humans see fit. The illegal wildlife trade is stated to be the fourth largest illegal trade, consequently, severely affects some animals to near extinction. \u2018Since its inception, CITES has aimed to conserve more than 35,000 species of animals and plants.\u2019 CITES also known as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora is a multilateral treaty between governments and aims to ensure the protection of endangered species are not under threat. This addresses the issue on a global scale to engage with the biggest markets of illegal wildlife trade."
"Over the next few months he began to grow a trusting friendship with this girl. George asked her out. She agreed. This dating went on for over a year. And on the anniversary of Lennie, George proposed to Robin. She said yes right away. George told her that there might be a bit of a wait before they got married because he didn\u2019t have enough money as he was working on a little cottage out in the country which he and Robin would move into in a few weeks."
"It is indispensable to observe that the designing of originative trade name logo of Foshan is different from planing logo for touristry since this is non merely a tourer trade name for tourer image but for all the stakeholders in the metropolis. The logotype should be suited for utilizing in broad field of metropolis publicity. Analyzing successful logos design for corporate and metropoliss in history, they have characteristics in common: simple and elegant, flexible in different clip and media, unforgettable and stand foring the value and characteristic of the metropolis. The choosing of the representation can be metropolis symbol every bit good as cardinal merchandise."
"A friend is someone who we can call in times both bad and good times. A friend also can be there to comfort you and help you with your problem. Friendships make life beautiful and colorful, adding significant value to life. Whether casual or close friendships, the role of friendship is increasingly important to happiness and health according to Macmilan (2017). However, male and female friendships are both similar and different in some aspects."
"The government of Afghanistan should enforce the law to prevent child marriages. For instance, keeping the marriage registration regularly by the government agencies and receiving the evidence and acquiescence of both sides could be a possible way to reduce the child marriage. For example, in parts of \u00a0Indonesia, registration of marriage is dependent on evidence that the marriage is not forced on couples (Sadik). The parents who marry their daughters in their childhood under the age 16 should punished and persecuted seriously by the government as governments of Norway and Kyrgyzstan did."
"Beginning with simpler reading materials that encourage and boost confidence in child before moving on to phrases or sentences. The other sensitive periods is movement. Children must be able to move around in their environment in order to learn about surroundings and form relationships and gain independence. The environment should be prepared to give opportunities for the child to crawl pull up and walk and run providing materials and toys visits to the park and outdoors activities. Child will learn those skills through repetition also increasing concentration and co-ordination."
"The betrayal between families didn\u2019t just stop there. Hannah also betrayed her own mother Eva by asking \u201c Mamma, did you ever love us?\u201d This question shows disrespect towards the sacrifice a mother makes towards making sure her children have everything they need to survive. In this context, the sacrifices Eva made to make sure all four of her children didn\u2019t die without any help from the children dad, BoyBoy. Both these situations happened while Hannah no longer had her husband in her life and without the help of BoyBoy, Eva had to take care of the children on her own. The betrayal among women in the context happens when men are absent. Another mother and daughter betrayal was between Nel and Helene. While Helene and Nel were on their way to visit her mother, Helene had a incident with the train conductor. Nel \u201cwanted to make certain that no man ever looked at her that way\u201d.\u00a0 This reveals that Nel didn\u2019t want to be anything like her mother."
"This dissimilarity between the two is portrayed in Act 1 Scene 1 when Claudio states how \u2018in mine eye\u2019 Hero is the \u2018sweetest lady\u2019 that he has ever seen, speaking of an idealised love which is evident with his exaggerations; Benedick however is able to \u2018see without spectacles\u2019 signifying how he is not fooled by appearances and this becomes important later in the development of the play as Benedick eventually becomes the voice of reason among the chaos which soon plays out."
"Explain why it is important to promote appropriate behaviour and respect for others (ref. 2.2) As learning take place in a social enviroment it will be fundamental to create a good atmosphere helping everyone attending to feel at ease in a space where learners feel safe and comfortable to express their opinion. Each student may have different background, culture, beliefs, experiences and needs, so it is very important to be open minded and to establish ground rules so to avoid any animosity, unrespectful behaviour and any kind of discrimination."
"As the saying goes, \u201ca woman\u2019s work is never done,\u201d but today\u2019s women live a far different life than their predecessors. The women of the revolution were courageous and brave-hearted. The obstacles of their time were far more difficult to overcome than those faced by women in this day and age. Whether it was slavery, war, or racial prejudice, these women kept their heads held high and worked to break down these barriers and create change for the future."
"Social workers and police would have a far easier job identifying whether or not parents were breaking the law. However often it would mean accepting a child\u2019s word against their parent\u2019s, it would provide many tricky cases for magistrates and juries. Enforcing the law would be very difficult; children would have to be confident to tell on their parents."
"Grief and trauma interventions for children encourages patients to express feelings and thoughts through drawings, and writings and playing to overcome traumas they may had in past experiences. Medications for Intermittent explosive disorder consist of SSRIs such as fluoxetine, mood stabilizers such as lithium, antipsychotics such as clozapine and haloperidol and beta blockers. Medications for autism spectrum disorders consists of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and antipsychotic medications such as risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and aripriprazole. Medications for ADHD consists of psychostimulant drugs such as methylphenidate and amphetamine salts and nonstimulant selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine. Burchum, J.R., 7 Rosenthal, L. D. (2016 Pharmacological and Parenteral Therapies; Dosage Calculation: Administering Chlorpromazine. Basic medication dose conversion and calculation skills are very important for providing safe nursing care. Nurses are responsible for administering correct amounts of medication and calculating precise amounts of medications to give to the patients. Using three different methods such as ratios proportions and formulas and dimensional analysis to correctly administering medications."
"Likewise, Catherine is clearly an independent female, even in her appearance: \u201cher eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle. \u201d The reader gets the sense that she dresses to please herself, not men. Through characters like Jordan and Catherine we get the sense that the 1920s may not have been as misogynistic as Tom\u2019s character leads us to believe, and therefore Tom Buchannan does not reflect important attitudes and values in real-life American society in the 1920s. Finally, Tom\u2019s views towards money and work alienate him from the genuine attitudes and values in real-life American society in the 1920s."
"In spite of all the difficulties that single parents face, many are highly successful in the childcare that they provide; hence, some pre-adolescent children still strives the normal course of development. However, children brought up in single parent families are still predicted to be at risk unless there are major social changes to provide more adequate support, and ways can be found for children to maintain satisfactory contact with their absent parents. The trend of dysfunctional parenting and broken relationships is likely to continue until training and help with relationships for children are given a higher priority by society (Polany, 2002 p.430)."
"Fate plays a vitally significant part in this play. Lord Capulet agrees to Paris\u2019 request for the hand of his daughter in marriage forcing Juliet into a marriage who she doesn\u2019t love. This is fate because if Capulet left Juliet to decide on who she marries, she would have not married Paris, but she would have married Romeo and possibly lived happily. Fate works in all of the events surrounding Romeo and Juliet: the feud between their families, the horrible series of accidents that ruin Friar Lawrence\u2019s plans at the end of the play, the tragic timing of Romeo\u2019s suicide and Juliet\u2019s awakening. These events are not just coincidences, but rather signs of fate that help bring about the unavoidable outcome of Romeo and Juliet\u2019s death."
"I am truly blessed to have him as my father. I know that I may not have experienced the things he has experienced in life, but the values he has taught me will always serve as my guiding light as I grow up and face the real world. Not only has my father taught me to become a better person, but also a real person, which I believe is more important. One of my wishes in life is that when I grow up, I would be able to raise a wonderful family like my father did and also teach them the lessons he has taught me."
"\u201d Also the quote \u201cSo lonely, sir! So very lonely! \u2018Every body hates me. Oh! Sir, don\u2019t, don\u2019t pray be cross to me! \u2018 the child beat his hands upon his heart; and looked in his companion\u2019s face, with tears and real agony\u201d is full of such pathos and tender emotions that we can empathize with the child\u2019s feelings. Further on in the book Dickens very effectively uses graphical language to describe Oliver\u2019s hunger, \u201cI wish some well-fed philosopher, whose meat and drink turn to gall within him\u2026"
"The 1920s were a time that Canadians were especially harsh to the Chinese immigrants. Even before the 1920s the Chinese faced hardship. They were the ONLY ethnic group to ever have to pay a head tax upon arrival. They were also forced to endure absurd laws such as taxes on rice and laundries or a law which stated that Chinese restaurants were forbidden to hire white women. Even so, Chinese immigration to Canada continued in full swing until the Chinese Exclusions Act was passed on July 1, 1923. This day is dubbed by the Chinese as \u201cHumiliation day\u201d and for many years they refused to celebrate Canada\u2019s national holiday. This act forbade all Chinese immigration to Canada except students, diplomats and merchants and in 1928 the act was amended to prohibit ALL immigration from China."
"As stated, John and Sue would like to save money even though they can already afford Child Care A, but looking at the circumstances of child development and all that goes with it, it will definitely be worth that extra money for the child to be placed in that facility. If saving money is also a concern with the parents, I would suggest looking at other areas that the couple can save a little money in."
"In itself, it has actually shown to have little unification with its own natives, and even after they were colonized by various European countries, it has actually failed to combine as one nation. Canada has even embraced the image of being a \u201cmosaic\u201d considering that it has actually been the home to people from all over the world (Harris, 1997). The Heritage Minutes"
"Gratitude is a thankful appreciation for what an individual receives, whether tangible or intangible.\u2013 think George Bailey at the end of It\u2019s a Wonderful Life. Once we begin practising gratitude, our brain actively looks for things to be grateful for, encouraging us to focus on the positive aspects of our lives."
"This will happen every three years and marked against unsatisfactory, satisfactory, good and outstanding. Task C Career Pathway There are various progression routes available to all who work with Casterbridge and the sector. Level 2 Certificate leads on to Level 3 Diploma \u2013 Room Manager, third in charge, Deputy Manager Level 3 Diploma leads on to Foundation Degree \u2013 Deputy Manager, Midwifery, Social work My personal career pathway plan is to complete the Level 3 Diploma then become a room manager then train to be an Assessor for Casterbridge."
"Civility on campus should be an important subject advertised to ensure a pleasant environment for the students to grow successfully. Going from high school to college is a big deal for incoming students. College has grown a reputation of a place to get educated with more freedom. In high school students are used to following strict rules of no cell phones, attendance, and proper behavior. Although college is a place for adults and allows more freedom than high school, a code of conduct has been twisted."
"Standard of living is used to suggest a person\u2019s wellbeing; it refers to the economic level of an individual such as; level of wealth and basic necessities available to a certain place, it is also an ambition that people set for themselves as a consumer (Nardinelli 2008). People migrating to more developed countries will often find that the same work they were doing back home is rewarded abroad with higher salaries and welfare benefits, thus, migrants are drawn to those developing countries where they can maximize their profit and benefits (Levin Institute 2006)."
"They did it because they found love and attention from their couple rather than their parents. I firmly agree that parents ignorance to children as the most cause of social ills nowadays. In a nutshell, parents should beware and make their family as their utmost priority in life to avoid this case occur. Their attitude just driving them into a loss and suffer at the end."
"To a large extent, kneeling during the national anthem has escalated division in the society. Although Kaepernick\u2019s can be justified as an avenue to air his grievances, the impact of the protest is beyond the personal realm now that a larger group is involved. Various sources report that the controversy is has led to heightened polarization[3]. In the simplest form, the society will have divergent views regarding the legality of the act. For instance, the failure to stand during the national anthem can be perceived as disrespect to the nation[4]. This view would be strongly held by disciplined officers and many other individual with a mind that standing during an anthem shows reverence the state. Such individuals would support any action to defend the land from such disrespect. On the other hand, others would perceive it right, either because kneeling is also an expression of reverence or because they feel that Kaepernick and any other individual has a right to choose what to do or not do to safeguard their dignity. Left unchecked, such a division would disrupt social order and significantly affect national unity."
"Football has changed.From it\u2019s origins of \u2018no rules\u2019 to a modern post war image and then now into its present post-modern image.High transfer fees, high ticket prices and high wages have changed the game.Although argumentative there is a belief that the game has drifted away from it\u2019s working class origins into a more middle class audience.Stadiums are more modern, they had to change.\u2019Italia 90\u2032 saw little or no hooliganism. Together with a good run for the English team helped promote a positive image of the game in the U.K. Satellite television has helped changed the environment by which football is viewed.However whilst the officials stand and pat themselves on the back they are becoming guilty of complacancy.We have still not rid the game of racism.Evidence from the England game against Turkey has shown it.As A consequence critics would argue that the English F.A got off lightly with a fine and not having to play the next home qualifying game against Slovakia behind closed doors at Middlesborough."
"There have been times where I\u2019m quick to think bad of someone who seems to be rude. But it\u2019s best to try and think of what they could be going through. People a lot of the times think only of themselves without really meaning to. We\u2019re quick to say someone is against us, but we don\u2019t usually imagine what could be going on that made them do what they did. It\u2019s easier to believe someone is doing this to us on purpose rather than thinking they might\u2019ve done it on accident or that they normally wouldn\u2019t and are just having a bad time."
"Easily, we can explain the reaction like 6 molecules of water plus, 12 molecules of Carbon Dioxide plus Sun energy, cross with chlorophillian pigment, in the product we have glucose, plus oxygen, plus water. We can put so briefly the process saying that the organisms use the energy from sunlight to produce sugar, which cellular respiration converts into ATP, The conversion of no usuable sunlight energy into usable chemical energy, is associated with the actions of the green pigment chlorophyll."
"Willy couldn\u2019t understand what made him happy and what he was best at, and chose rather to follow a hollow dream of ending up being a terrific salesperson. When his phony imagine wealth and popularity began to fall apart, Willy started losing control of his life and his mind. This forced Willy to raise wealth for his family by unfortunately ending his life."
"When I have problem she will give me some advices and help me to solve the problem. Even when I don\u2019t understand in the lesson she explained patiently, for me to understand every time. I think I\u2019m really lucky that I have my mother as my best friend and I\u2019m very happy we are friends and I think we will be friends forever. In conclusion, I think my mom is a nice person. She has good appearance, personality and I\u2019m very happy that I can be friend with my mom who is cute, responsible and always help me in everything."
"Everyone has friends. Friends are people whom one can trust with one\u2019s deepest secrets, knowing that they will not be betrayed. True friends surround one with good vibes and never discourage one with what they love to do. In any friendship, anyone can find the similarities and differences between the two. The two friends seem to walk, talk, and act the same. In contrary, they are so different that it is a wonder how they are still friends to this day."
"This Katie is very distressed after being raped that she walked straight past her boyfriend proposing, and out of the room. Here is where we represented the table for one, Katie\u2019s boyfriend has been left on his own, he was about to ask the most important question of his life and his girlfriend, who he doesn\u2019t know has been raped, walked straight past ignoring him. After this scene, the second Katie, who didn\u2019t get raped is showing off her engagement ring to her friends played by Georgina and Fiona, in the pub. Although we didn\u2019t show it, Katie said yes to her boyfriend and now she is happily engaged."
"Undoubtedly, one of the most valued and admirable relationship is that of a true and loyal friend. In my opinion, if one is fortunate enough to come across a person that is unquestionably reliable and trustworthy and they have found themselves a valuable friend. In order to reciprocate this friendship, one must actively consider the ways in which this relation can be continuously nurtured. In order to maintain a friendship, we must first begin with being loyal and trustworthy with one another, respecting each other\u2019s opinions and beliefs, and be willing to set aside our egos."
"It is evident that from many sectors across the United State the optimal performance and productivity of every individual, American or individual of color, is enhanced because of the decrease in segregation. And because of this, the country\u2019s monoculturalism has been translated into a pool of diversity where the maximum potentials of individual contribute to the improvement of every aspect of the nation and the true meaning of democracy and civil rights has been sufficed (Parillo, 2008, p. 68). Apparently there is a continuous increase in the multicultural society in the United States and various changes are taking place. However, it is important to note that the growing number of racial minorities in the country does not always post a negative impact on the nation as a whole. What many do not realize is the fact that the things that are sometimes viewed to be a threat for the improvement of United States could also be an asset."
"Child soldiers is a worldwide phenomenon, which goes way back in history. In 2000, The United Nations General Assembly adopted The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict as a supplementary protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (Wikipedia). The treaty whereby states agree to prohibit the conscription into the military of children under the age of 18 and ensure that military volunteers under the age of 18 are exempted from taking a direct part in hostilities."
"She does not say, \u201cMy hips are like a desk,\u201d but says, \u201cMy hips are a desk.\u201d Throughout the rest of the poem, personification of the women as nothing more than a piece of office equipment is expressed with striking realism. In the first six lines of the poem , the speaker describes herself in much detail."
"The races that are discriminated against find it very upsetting that there are so many laws aimed towards equality and yet racism is so prominent. African Natives were brought into the United States against their will, forced to stay here without any rights, and then fought for freedom but was still discriminated against. Over 179,000 African American men fought in the American Civil War in over 160 units. Some slaves were even forced to fight on the Confederate side of the war in labor positions. Many of the African Americans who fought on the Union side were previously slaves who sought freedom. They did not receive equal pay for fighting, though. African American men typically collected ten dollars a month, while white men made thirteen. Today, about ninety two percent of African Americans reported feeling discriminated against at some point in their lives according to a recent study by Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The people who submitted the survey were of many backgrounds and ages. Beverly Reeves, who was in an interview about African American individuals, being an African American herself, said that being treated differently than caucasians was \u201cduh\u201d. It was to be expected and she had experienced racism throughout her life. She goes on to tell a story about how she booked a manicure appointment for her and her friends. It was a mix of black and white women. The white salon owner looked right past her and helped the white friends before helping her, even though she was there first and was the one who booked the appointment. The conductor of the interview states that this sort of situation isn\u2019t uncommon. Another individual reported being told there were no houses available for real estate in her area, but gave a different answer to a white couple. This stereotype isn\u2019t just expressed within African Americans, but many other races as well, such as Mexican Americans."
"Drawing the Color Line, basically suggest and provoke the hostile living conditions of slaves, black and white under different level of circumstances. It also explained as why slavery prevailed despite rebellious acts countering brutality and unjustness among the slaves. Howard Zinn, noted how the masters could economically benefit from its slaves. The author also brought up the factors and reasons as to why slavery sprouted in the continent as he stated \u201cWe see now a complex web of historical threads to ensnare blacks for slavery in America: the desperation of starving settlers, the special helplessness of the displaced African, the powerful incentive of profit for slave trader and planter, the temptation of superior status for poor whites, the elaborate controls against escape and rebellion, the legal and social punishment of black and white collaboration.\u201d\u00b7\u00b7 \u201cThe system was psychological and physical at the same time. The slaves were taught discipline, were impressed again and again with the idea of their own inferiority to \u201cknow their place,\u201d to see blackness as a sign of subordination, to be awed by the power of the master, to merge their interest with the master\u2019s, destroying their own individual needs.\u201d"
"Slavery exists in Utopia. My Safe Haven would consist of one where everyone is equal and there would be no such thing as slavery. I feel as though slavery is a hate crime. In my society everyone would be treated equal and people don\u2019t judge others by their own beliefs. There would be no religion based in my government because some people may not believe what others believe. First I\u2019d remove the idea of religion out of government and take in God we trust off our money and put in its place in people of society we trust or in the community we trust."
"Aspirations for human beings are endless. Female who had subjected to long years of interdependence feels elated when they become independent? Shakutai makes her daughter to be an aspiring girl who gets education and leads a duty free life which is contrary with Mira\u2019s mother. But independence in women life ended in disruption of her entire life. She has been brutally raped by Prabakar. She is so fearful that Kalpana\u2019s sister will not get married if their incident is known to the public. It is inferred that the men create problems to augment their distress by the rape and consensual rape within marriage, but sometime like Kalpana\u2019s mother, women tend to be the problem makers by denying truth and maintain silence either for their own or family gain. Altogether, the women suffer the most."
"Throughout this paper, there will be the highly debatable discussion between legalizing medical marijuana and regular marijuana. Both sides of the argument have their pros and cons and there is an in depth description of both sides of the argument. At the end of the day though, the paper thoroughly supports the legalization of medical marijuana and marijuana in general. Medical marijuana less harmful than most other legal tobacco products and has the ability to reduce the pain within ailing people."
"With divisions in a number of nations where they create their own human resource and other policies, a culture that does not support leadership of women and minorities will hold resistance to change. Changes would need to be made to the organizational structure, the corporate culture, and the human resource department."
"B1) What is the theme of the story? The theme of the story is quite complexed as it both deals with the racism issues which unfolded in the incredebly segregated society of South Africa, and at the same time shows how complicated and paradoxical this separation of black and white people is. This appears in the text as Lucas turns out to be the result of Marais\u2019 extramarital relations, and as Lucas dies caused by his father, the whole affair becomes a personal tragedy for Marais Van der Vyver. But Marais knowns by himself that the story of this hunting mishap in the eyes of the opposition overtly is a callous act of negligent shooting and a perfect example of the still opressed blacks of South Africa."
"Finding friends is what we are wired to do, however, finding good friends is not as easy. There are things friends should and shouldn\u2019t do culturally we have guidelines when looking for a good friend. There are a few general ones every age groups strives to find. These include but are not limited to being trustworthy, having the best interests at heart, enjoyable, similar interests, and provide aide. In Intimate Relationships Miller stated that women have higher standards when finding a good friend. They expect their friends to be more trustworthy, enjoyable and self-disclosure. The pickier one is with choosing friends the deeper the bond they will form in the long run."
"Custodial atrocities and Brutality are rampant because of impractical demands and expectation of the society to take tough action. Even a large section of society feels that despite their excesses police carries out a necessary and unpleasant task of preserving and protecting the state. Given the complex nature of crime problems and the painfully show judicial process (that take years to decide cases and lets off the accused on technical ground), the public, in their desperation quite often approve of the police excesses if these restore tranquility and give hell to those dreaded terrorist, gangsters, dacoits and professionals criminals who let loose terror in the area and victimize thousands of unresourced citizens. The police men who confront these criminals and kill them in real or fake encounter earn people\u2019s appreciation. The condoning public attitude of police highhandedness is used as an alibi for justifying police torture (Rai, 1999 Majumdar 1995; BPR&D 1993)."
"However, performance in these tables informs school accountability and inspections by OFSTED with schools who are deemed to be underperforming facing various sanctions including increased scrutiny, potential takeover by neighbouring schools or even closure\u2019 (Leckie & Goldstein, 2016). This has caused attainment levels to become high stake targets in schools. This marketisation and accountability of schools has created a potential conflict with inclusive policies. In this paper I will outline why I believe that the standards agenda and inclusion are mutually exclusive, but first I will examine some of the arguments in favour of the agenda."
"Source C could be useful to a historian. The signs reading, \u2018no coloureds etc\u2019, support the idea of the \u2018colour bar\u2019. We can ensure it is reliable because it is a photograph and does not look in anyway set up. It does not reveal why it was taken. This source also supports the fact that only 15 out of 1000 white people would let a room to someone black. There was no law stating that landlords could not discriminate in this way. The immigrants in the photographs are looking at boards full of advertisements, nevertheless we are only given examples of two of them \u2013 we are unaware of any others, which could not be as discriminative as the two shown. There are only two immigrants in this photograph indicating there may not be a big problem to get housing, as was claimed at the time (because of the bombing during the war there was a housing shortage)."
"A large portion of Parenting experts think that staying together when things aren\u2019t working and the parents can\u2019t be civil to one another can only harm a child and in turn set the example for how they will parent when the time comes (Parker,2018). Although, Other researchers argue just the opposite that parents should stay together at all costs (Parker, 2018). If a child is being abused or maltreated in any sense of the word separation should be considered to protect the child (Parker,2018). Staying together for the kids isn\u2019t appropriate in some instances."
"Armand Aubigny shows his violent features all along the story, also seen when he makes his wife leave their house, \u201cYes, I want you to go\u201d, which will be more in deep developed among this essay. Armand does not seem to feel or to care, instead, he appears as a really insensitive person; \u201cforgotten how to be gay\u2026Armand\u2019s dark,handsome face had not often been disfigured by frowns since the day he fell in love with her. \u201d It is not only his behavior but also his physical characteristics are showing a person who is not present, and is not taking care of his things in life."
"\u201cNot objective, inherent, or fixed, they (races) correspond to no biological or genetic reality; rather, races are categories that society invents, manipulates, or retires when convenient. \u201d (Delgado & Stefancic, 2000). This is because though people share certain physical and genetic traits such as hair texture and color, eye shape, average height, skin color, etc, they are mostly overridden by differences in the higher-order traits such as intelligence, behavior and personality. Society however chooses to club people into distinct racial groups, ignoring scientific facts and attributing hypothetical racial characteristics on these groups."
"The black family is positively viewed as a source of support and resistance against racism by black feminists. However other feminists argue that this approach neglects the fact that, despite such differences, women do in fact share many of the same experiences. For example, women face a greater risk of domestic violence and sexual assault and low pay compared with men. Feminism is criticised for ignoring the increased family diversity of families in the modern day, and although the nuclear family remains important, it is by no means the only family type."
"Sex Roles: A Journal of Research, which reports from a feminist perspective, is an academic science journal that focuses on issues involving gender and its impact on other aspects of people\u2019s lives. The author of the article, Linda Sax, is a professor in the Graduate School of Education & Information Studies at UCLA. She has published several articles revolving around gender, STEM, and their progression, this being only one of many. Since it is one of her main areas of study, she would be considered a reliable source on the issue. This article in particular was published in 2013 meaning it would not be considered \u201cnew,\u201d but in the context of the topic, it is still applicable and reliable. The journal\u2019s and the author\u2019s perspectives both align with my own which I can use to support my claims. However, since it is a book review, it does not have many facts or statistics, but it does provide different focuses that can help me organize my argument and paper as a whole. For example, Sax discusses the necessity to inspect STEM fields separately rather than as one big whole, the positives and negatives of male mentorships, women in leadership positions within the field, and the gender disproportion in patenting."
"This understanding reflects the historical experiences and cultural norms that are shared that make those in the Caribbean as a solidified unit, even through the division and changes in their history. This oneness is what the Black Diaspora must find. \u00a0The second point is with all the similarities, there are also differences within the identities (394). Without the focus on what the Caribbean has overcome and created, there is no ease in speaking of the Caribbean identity as a singular experience or identity. There are disconnections that make up the Caribbean distinctive identity."
"Lawmakers should require training on how to safely secure firearms in the homes of citizens. Lawmakers should also diminish gun access to youth and people who are capable of injuring others or even themselves. Weapon should be retained from individuals who have been vicious toward their peers, and those who have a history of violent tendicies."
"Respecting the tradition of student clubs, the comrades gave the community a mysterious name. A former member of Kentucky Centre College, Kennedy had the Greek word kuklos meaning \u201ccircle\u201d; Crowe split it in two and changed the final, obtaining \u201cKu Klux\u201d; observing that the founders were of Scottish descent, Lester proposed adding an evocation of the \u201cclan\u201d by harmonizing it with the general spelling. Crowe finds it amusing to disguise the members, as well as their horses, with the sheets and pillowcases stolen from one of their hosts\u2019 houses. The Ku Klux Klan KKK has just been born\u2026."
"35) When the injured man didn\u2019t show up for any of the court dates the judge threw out the charges. prosecutors still could have revived the case but his lawyer pleaded with them to give him a break and not to pursue the matter. They didn\u2019t and Rameck got a second chance."
"The idea that gender roles are pre-determined by society is explored within Pride and Prejudice and A Thousand Splendid Suns. The time period was saturated by patriarchy as male dominance was prevalent. Throughout both novels we are shown how the upbringings of females living in different society standards has led to a different outcome which is portrayed in their actions and behaviour."
"The Beveridge Report was thus aimed at eradicating the five great evils of the time: want, disease, ignorance, squalor and idleness, all seen to affect families. (Beveridge report, class notes) A series of legislative measures under the postwar Labour government began to translate this vision into concrete action. One of these was the 1945 Family Allowances Act. Aimed at all families, this act moved from a selective to a universalist notion of welfare provision and is often regarded as the blueprint for the modern welfare state3."
"They\u2019re also a boon to the economy and culture of the U.S., he said, adding that even the\u00a0costs of undocumented immigrants are outweighed by the taxes they pay and the work ethic they bring. \u201cImmigration itself is an entrepreneurial act,\u201d \u2026 \u201cChurches have long been a key player in helping immigrants adjust to life in America. Yet it\u2019s rare that immigration is brought up in church services, he said, and a recent poll showed that an overwhelming majority of evangelicals say their views on immigration are driven by factors other than their Christianity. The Bible, though, has much to say about immigrants, said Soerens, who repeatedly cited the chapter and verse of salient points. \u201cGer,\u201d a Hebrew word that translates to immigrant, appears 92 times in the Old Testament, he noted. And Biblical heroes Abraham, Rebekah, Joseph, Ruth, David and Paul were immigrants. So too was Jesus, for that matter\u201d (Jacksonville.com, 2015)."
"\u201cIdentity theft is the unauthorized collection of personal information and its subsequent use for criminal reasons such as to open credit cards and bank accounts, redirect mail, set up cell phone service, rental vehicles, and even get a job. These actions can mean severe consequences for the victim, who will be left with bills, charges, and a damaged credit score.\u201d"
"A reader may comment on the significance of \u201cno money\u201d as this could suggest that the society she has grown up in, she understands that having a lack of money and being a female you cannot excel in life. Marriage was seen more as an economic arrangement and making sure that the female has financial security as well as being able to increase the status of herself and her family. This could suggest that a female is viewed more like an asset than a human. These ideas portray the negative effects of societal expectations on females as they were only expected to be housebound and reliant on the male characters implying that these roles have already been set out by society. A reader may comment that Austen has shown these negative impacts of marriage to expose the flaws within society and the prejudice women had to endure."
"I am confident that with my Undergraduate Degree in Mechanical Engineering and Industry related experience including techno-functional expertise in optimization solutions, Project Management experience, personal traits like quest for detail, inquisitiveness and desire to excel ,and passion to lead teams make me a strong candidate for a Post Graduation degree in Industrial Engineering."
"The indignities of being a poor child of immigrants in Brother portrays the careless prejudices and low expectations that confront Michael and Francis consequently, making them appear as perpetual outsiders due to their economic and ethnic status. The challenges immigrants face are perceived when Michael and Francis experience racial discrimination, financial difficulties and social isolation."
"Therefore, of course there are still much more rights to fight for, but after the Stonewall Riots gays and lesbians were able to hold hands in public, to kiss, to show affection for each other and even now, to get married in several countries. Conclusion To conclude, we have explained how the Stonewall Riots were the way that the LGBT Community found in order to defend their sexual preferences and their rights. In addition, we have also shown the consequences of that day and how"

"Tocqueville supports the idea that Native Americans inhabited North America well before the white Europeans did, they lived by their own tribal customs, norms, values, religious beliefs and laws. However, Native Americans are now seen as dispossessed through the formalities of the law \u201cit is impossible to destroy men with more respect for the laws of humanity\u201d [4]. Tocqueville argues that the government will not grant them their own enjoyment of Native-American leaving in freedom so they had no elite but to possess this crucial primarily for lifestyle of civilisation. This could be one of the reasons of their segregation in American- they chose not to be civilised because they had planned on keeping their own cultures, customs and traditions. Native Americans \u201crepels civilisation perhaps less in hatred of it than in fear of resembling the European\u2019 [4]. Although, Tocqueville implies that it is challenging for Native- Americans to acquire it- this could be because they are not used to white cultures perhaps see white customs and lifestyles as dishonour, perhaps evil this could be the reason why native Americans did not accept civilisation or seen as part of the race relations. Even if they did accept civilisation there will be prejudices against Natives American which will prevent them from becoming civilised which then obliges them to it. In contrast, Tocqueville suggests that Native Americans still had some\u00a0acknowledge their identities cultures compared to other races such as African-Americans because America is their homeland therefore native Americans will do anything but to be assimilated perhaps so they can their sense of pride, and dignity."
"These aspects include the biological, psychological, social, cultural and spiritual. These aspects can help social workers better understand the background history of a person\u2019s life and gather information in order to do an accurate assessment of a person. This paper does not intend to make an assessment but it\u2019s rather an informative paper in order to discover and understand the various systems of a person\u2019s life. Furthermore this paper will also focus on how these systems interact with one another."
"My interest in working with young children comes from not only having children of my own, but also having spent fifteen years in the childcare industry in various teaching and administrative roles. Upon graduating from high school, I began my work in childcare as an assistant teacher of ages threes and fours and then moved on to another daycare facility in the position of head infant teacher. During this time, I was also pursuing a real estate license and was taking liberal arts courses at a community college."
"One must learn that this kind of self-respect does not come easily. Among many successes, there will be failures along the way that one must accept as inevitable. We are human. We will all fail; there are no exceptions. Even one who holds their self in the highest regard will have to come to learn this. The difference between self-respect as a value of self-worth and one\u2019s regard for their standing or position is that when one fails their standing in society diminishes as a result while self-worth cannot be destroyed by a failure unless one allows it too. That is why it is of the greatest importance that we begin to view self-respect as the way we view ourselves, not the way we are viewed by society. We must free ourselves from the expectations of others and find ways to like our selves with all of our imperfections and flaws. It is only then can one discover the real meaning of self-respect."
"The misconception that you have to go to culinary school to learn how to cook for yourself is a reason that people get discouraged and do not think they have the ability to learn something that requires a lot of technique. Another reason to learn how to cook is because it can lead to a healthier lifestyle. A positive effect of cooking is becoming a more independent person and being able to know your body and exactly what it needs. The benefits of cooking vary from fighting off bacteria to being able to have higher quality food. Cooking is a very inclusive activity and for this reason cultures are continuously incorporating different aspects of cultures cuisines in their own food."

"The apparition at that point leaves Hamlet by requesting that he render retribution on Claudius who has turned into a sovereignty of Denmark, and furthermore hitched Hamlet\u2019s mom. It is now that he focuses on avenging the homicide of his dad. Be that as it may, Hamlet misses various chances to get his submitted revenge. Perusers would now be able to ponder, for what reason would he not take these risks to get the vengeance that he genuinely needs? The conceivable explanation behind such a deferral could be on the grounds that he needs to discover an open door that could give him the most achievement in his objective of murdering Claudius."
"Various persons have realized the danger of losing one\u2019s social identity. As a result, when in a strange country immigrants usually look for persons who came from the same country as them, have the same culture or religion and usually of the same class. Therefore, a poor Gujar from Pakistan arriving in Britain would not look up a wealthy Gujar in hopes that he will allow him to live with him or even by him."
"His ghost lies beneath the truth of secrecy. I convinced myself he would return someday and when he would, he would swoop Jackie and I into those big, comforting arms of his and kiss us until we begged for mercy. It was May 24th, the day before Bring your father to school day. Every four years, the district would host a Father\u2019s Day and Mother\u2019s Day, where you could bring one of your parents to school and show them what you did on a regular school day-to-day basis. I often daydreamed what would happen on that day in particular when my dad would finally travel down from work and come to my school. Arriving, I would reveal my favorite seat in class, take him to the library where we\u2019d read my favorite books: \u201cThe Chamber of Secrets,\u201d and \u201cEsperanza Rising.\u201d I would invite him to rest on my favorite chair in the library, the one with the big, comfy seat and headrest, and later he\u2019d join to play with me during recess. Later, I\u2019d proudly introduce him to everyone in school to show them My Dad. It sounds a bit selfish, but if you were constantly getting picked on for the absence of your father on Father\u2019s Day at school\u00b7 you\u2019d understand. I pratted endlessly of my father\u2019s return from his full-time job. That night, I called upon the stars hoping they\u2019d hear my cries for help. I prayed to God for his arrival, and asked God if he could guide my father tonight as he flew down to the valley. After years of unanswered questions, calls ending with the same voicemail, his arrival was only hours away. Every four years they have this special day, so my father knew. I know my father, and he wouldn\u2019t miss a chance to be with his angel for the world."
"If their attraction had been purely physical they would have drifted away after whetting their sexual desires. But their love was very intense. Soon after their blissful communion the ship in which they were travelling, started sinking down. Had they not loved each other; they would have run for their lives without caring for the other one. But they did not want to loose each other at any cost. 2) There are many motives of romantically pursuing a person. One motive can be to obtain sexual satisfaction through the other person."
"An analysis of cross-sectional studies has established that unemployment was associated with anxiety or depression symptoms with a moderate (Cohen\u2019s d) effect size of 0.51, indicating a doubling of considerable psychological distress from 16% in employed populations to 34% in unemployed populations\u201d. Paul., Moser. (2009). The main cause of stress caused by unemployment is financial stress. Sub-analysis of the same study indicated that the relationship between unemployment and psychological symptoms was mainly mediated by financial strain. Vinokur et al. (1997)."
"The second of the stronger arguments for UG is that of \u2018Convergence\u2019, which is the notion that individuals converge on the same grammar despite receiving very different input. Referring again to work by Chomsky, as well as some of the supporters of his theory, she notes that the claims regarding convergence are made without any actual supporting evidence. She then refers to empirical studies ( ) where evidence has found differences in the grammar of individuals who speak the same language. The differences included a range of grammatical and morphological variances, as well as inconsistencies in comprehension. In a study done by Street and Dabrowska in 2010 showed considerable differences in linguistic competence rather than performance of native speakers, which suggests that the idea of convergence is based on a false premise."
"Students are born with the requirement and want to attach with those around them (jones, 2015). Once academics and suppliers establish positive relationships with students from birth through the first years and worth their numerous cultures and languages, students feel safe and secure, parturition the muse for healthy social and emotional development. This method affects, however, students expertise the globe, specific themselves, manage their emotions, and establish positive relationships with others. Social and emotional development involves many interconnected areas of development, together with social interaction, emotional awareness, and self-regulation. One important piece to supporting the positive development of all young students is connecting with families."
"Be that as it may, it didn\u2019t harm my confidence or anything like that\u201d. All through the article, she utilizes humor despite the fact that she is by all accounts a severe woman, that doesn\u2019t sit around messing around \u201cOne visitor named Marcy got so annoyed she separated in tears and needed to leave early."
"D Hope and \u2018The Window\u2019- a short story by Pham Thi Hoai. Our identities are always subject to change as it is strongly linked to our ever- changing surroundings. This concept of identity is reinforced in The Death of the Bird by A. D Hope through the shift in the mood of the poem. The poet\u2019s diction as he depicts the migrating journey of the bird as it travels through the \u2018warm passage to the cooling station\u2019 and is \u2018sure and safely guided by \u2018love\u2019 emphasises the bird\u2019s strong emotional ties to the place where it belongs creating safe and comfortable mood."
"The target market for the magazine is divided into three groups which include: \u2013 1. Parents The magazines will have articles that educate the parents on how to bring up their children, together, with giving them tips on how to spice-up their sexual relationships, how to cook delicious and nutritious foods, and how to run their homes. This usually consists of 35% of the general population."
"They live isolated lives and are alienated from each other because are rivals. They are struggling to survive in a hostile world. All of these factors make all the characters lonely in \u2018Of Mice and Men\u2019. Between them, there are some characters who are very lonely because they are disadvantaged, Crooks, he\u2019s black; Candy, because he is old; Curley, because he has more security than others; and his wife, as she is the only woman on the ranch."
"The term inclusion in diversity refers to the acceptance of the people of the diversified communities belonging to different caste, age, gender, or country, should be given relevance in the organization as they are the equal members of the organization and have their right speak against the discrimination taking place in the organization on a daily basis, which should not be acceptable in any of the organization (Brimhall, & Mor Barak, 2018). Various cases pertaining to the same issues across the country are registered and the corrective actions are not taken on time."
"The sources of other authorities, such as the sources of the scientific studies, the photographs, and short informational videos, are all named at the end of the documentary, if not stated by Gore himself during his presentation. The sources of information are current as well as a few years old, after all there were studies done in the past that were used in order to compare today\u2019s statistics. Also, the authorities are respected by the audience in the way that the audience simply believes the information being given to them through out the\u00a0documentary."
"This effect is relevant because studies have shown that exposure to these images of women displayed in rap videos, can surely affect teen\u2019s attitudes and perceptions. It is revealed that the effects of subsequent judgments of male-female interactions are associated with the sexual subordinate roles portrayed by women in rap music videos. However, the purpose of this study is to determine whether the effects of exposure to rap music videos that contain nonviolence will influence the approving attitudes toward dating violence among teens as a function of gender."
"Some may argue that Atticus was not responsible enough when taking care of his children. Parts of the book may show his leniency towards what he allows his children to do and an attitude that may be perceived as nonchalant, such as when \u201cAtticus said as tactfully as he could that he just didn\u2019t think he could stand a pageant tonight, he was all in. He had been in Montgomery for a week and had come home late that afternoon. He thought Jem might escort [Scout] if [she] asked him\u201d (Lee 134). However, Maycomb is a small town and it is okay for Jem and Scout to walk around together because there are neighbors watching out for them. He has taught them to be responsible and it is a learning experience for them. \u201cAtticus liked Maycomb, he was Maycomb County born and bred; he knew his people, they knew him, and because of Simon Finch\u2019s industry, Atticus was related by blood or marriage to nearly every family in the town\u201d (Lee 3). Almost everyone in the town knew Scout and Jem, and so it was not irresponsible for Atticus to choose a parenting style that allowed them more freedom. When taken out of context, quotes from Lee\u2019s To Kill a Mockingbird may support a person\u2019s claim that Atticus was irresponsible, but these claims are based on a disproportionate scale to the time period, location and circumstances. His parenting may not have worked in a large, unsafe city during the present day and under different circumstances, but it is clear that throughout the book, he consistently showed excellent parenting skills when all factors are considered."
"According to a survey in America, female\u2019s salary at work is 75% as low as male\u2019s. Coming back to last century, at work, when men were paid 1 dollar, the amount that women received was just 58 cents, in accordance with the law in 1963 (Tran 2012) . And in Vietnam, gender inequality is shown in the difference between two genders in the number of babies. Statistics of Ministry of Planning & Investment in 2010 reported that there were 110."
"In my opinion, Shylock was justified in seeking revenge, but he takes it too far. He was victimized but one is also repulsed by his treatment of his daughter and his mercenary attitude. Although I think that his seeking revenge against Antonio was reasonable, his way of executing it was not."
"We uniquely represent all products of whom we want to, and it starts in your head. We are complete when we feel valuable, loved and felt we have a purpose. Unluckily, some are raised being told that they are none of these things and treated a lemon or a black sheep. We are not born a confounded nuisance and not taken as a lemon. Our parents represent the ones who maintain the responsibility to define us. Parents are unperfect, commonly fail to demonstrate or admit that fact merely. Parents\u2019 duties are to show help and prepare their children for their adult lives. Parents are supposed to demonstrate many skills. To name a few ordinary tasks, personal responsibility, accountability, how to express themselves and set foundations for them to become strong assets to society."
"Herodotus uses phrases such as \u201caccording to the Persian account\u201d to show that the Greeks probably had a different way of viewing the same event (in this case on how Io came to Egypt in Book One). The following four books is the story of the war itself, consisting of the invasions of Greece by Persian emperors Darius and Xerxes to the Greek victories at Salamis, Plataea and Mycale in 480 and 479 B. C. Herodotus work parallels mythology, and at numerous times gives mythological accounts."
"In spite of the statistics provided by the ex-post world war migrations, the global community is witnessing migration pressures. For instance, the immigration departments of developed nations in developing countries feature extended queues for people lined to fill up immigration applications. The United States department of foreign migration stated that in 2010, the number of waiting list admission totaled to 3.6 million. Besides, the surge in illegal migration and especially across the United States southern border as well as into Western Europe from the south and the east is symbolic of the influx of migration. The immigration department in the United States recorded nearly 300,000 cases of illegal immigrants in 2010 alone (UN Chronicle). In the Western Europe, this figure is estimated to be about 400,000 to 500,000 immigrants (UN Chronicle). In the OECD countries, illegal immigrants are said to add ten top fifteen per cent stock to the foreign born children."
"How is feminism manifested, and how is the traditional role of the female treated? Feminism has always gotten attention in the news, politics, and has advocated for gender equality. But on the other hand there are women who are used to be in the traditional role. To stay on topic feminism has manifested in the story \u201cA Sorrowful Woman\u201d and \u201cThe Secret Sorrow\u201d. It has manifested in both of those stories to show that women are depended to get pregnant, raise children and be a housewife."
"Methodologically, researchers used a sample of women who wanted abortions, comparing women who arrived just before the gestational age limit to women who arrived just after. By doing this, they were able to isolate the effects of receiving a wanted abortion, separate from need or desire to receive an abortion. This eliminates the confounding variables related to whether a pregnancy was unwanted, thus increasing the reliability and validity of the study. In this way, the researchers can be sure that economic hardship resulted from carrying the unwanted pregnancy to term rather than because they were denied an abortion."
"The biggest ones are generally prejudice, culture and upbringing and religious beliefs. Prejudice is \u2018a preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or personal experience\u2019 thus creating barriers to recognizing equality of rights for all. Cultural barriers can prevent, for example, consideration of spiritual, relational or dietary needs that do not conform to traditional expectations. Religious belief, where different religious beliefs are not taken into account and minorities are marginalized and not acknowledged. Other significant barriers could be structural, institutional and personal: Structural, where circumstances create or result in barriers \u2014 for example in access to a \u2019good education\u2019 adequate housing, sufficient income to meet basic needs."
"Cromwell believes More will change his stance on the King\u2019s divorce, but Rich objects, saying More will not be easily frightened. While Rich represents how one can sacrifice their own moral conscience in the face of gain, Cromwell appears to have nothing to gain, which makes him appear more evil in that he is trying to bring More down for the sake of it. Guilt is a recurring theme throughout the play, and is strongly exemplified in this extract as despite Rich\u2019s own guilt, he easily succumbs to the temptation Cromwell offers to him, revealing his pathetic character traits which were first brought to light in the opening scene."
"All these factors and techniques brought together with the fact that this text remains relevant and interesting makes \u201caway\u201d an excellent option for SBS and in particular \u201ctimes are changing\u201d. The Island \u201cThe island\u201d (Armen Greder, 2005, Patmos verla GmbH) is an excellent picture book by Armin Greder which tells the story of a man who is a foreigner to an island populated with a xenophobic group. It makes an ideal text for your show as it addresses many key issues like belonging and the change that stems from it."
"Glaciers are also being destroyredby global warming .The National Ice and Snow Data Center presents evidence that glaciers are retreating globally. Thos areas include the Alps, the Himalayas, the Andes, the Rockies, Alaska, and Africa. )National Snow and Ice Data Center, 2016( This proves that is something that is felt all over the world and isn\u2019t just a strange, local phenomenom. It is a global catastrophe that needs to be addressed."
"Unless we tend to develop positive feelings towards individuals completely different from us. we tend to don\u2019t worry these individuals as a result of we tend to accepted them in our contemporaries. we tend to defend our friends, in spite of wherever they are available from, their language, their coloring, etc."
"Because of the time duration, the dove in her left hand is missing its head. However, looking closely, the viewer can notice that the neck of the dove is turned back to face the girl. Possibly, if the head was still there, the dove would be looking back to say farewell as well. The Stele of a Little Girl\u2019s timelessness relates to the bronze statue of Eros Sleeping. Eros Sleeping is a 33 and 3/8-inch statue from the Hellenistic period, first century B. C. E. It is a sculpture of baby Eros, god of love, sleeping on a rock. The rock on which he sleeps is a modern addition, but the original was most likely made of stone (metmuseum. rg). A sculpture of Eros as a baby is interesting because he looks very peaceful as opposed to his unkind reputation. The sculpture makes Eros seem innocent and allows the viewer to solely see him as the god of love without the complications he causes. Eros is a freestanding sculpture making him look more relaxed and casual. He lies on the rock, disarmed and exhausted looking. It is clear he is exhausted because it seems as if he is in a very deep sleep since is arms and legs are hanging over the rock, his hair is tousled, and his mouth is open."
"Domestic violence is a crime that affects every member of the family, including children. Many times children remain the silent victims that are abused both physically and psychologically. Family violence creates an environment where children live in constant fear and confusion. They are psychologically torn between the abusive parent and the parent who is subject to the abuse. They are affected in ways that make it hard to establish nurturing bonds with either parent."
"Being a leader is a trait of mine I really love about myself, I just want to keep helping other follow the right path to being successful. Being a police officer is a dream job of mine. I believe I fit the qualifications of becoming one, and having my desired position as a detective. I am hardworking, trustworthy, reliable, and have strong leadership skills."
"Although Ross and Carol split and it becomes known that Carol is a lesbian, she ends up still being pregnant with Ross\u2019 son, Ben. When Ben starts to grow up and pick his toys of choice, he goes for the barbie doll. The rest of the episode circles around Ross trying to steer Ben away from the dolls and more towards more stereotypically masculine toys such as action figures and trucks until finally, someone calls him out on his obsession at the very end of the episode. My final issue with Friends is in regards to transphobia."
"France where is the country with many beautiful place, beautiful architect like Louvre, Notre Dame Cathedral and the Eiffel Tower. Nowadays, we know about the population France is 66.6 millions of people. People want know how much growth of in instantaneous. So people use an instantaneous rate of change for finding a result in during a time. Instantaneous used for describing a motivate something in during have define a time. Instantaneous apply for finding instantaneous around a time like instantaneous acceleration, physics, or marginal cost, profit."
"A positive of photo/ video observations is it allows EYP to review observations and identify development and abilities that they might not have noticed. They can recap the observations to make sure they don\u2019t miss any information. Another positive of this observation is parents can see specifically what the child did without reading a big page of observations. The last positive of this observation is it doesn\u2019t require much time so therefore this type of observation is more frequent."
"Laura allows herself to become lost in phonograph records left by their father, the records themselves holding memories of the past. Even Jim is entangled by the memories of his days as a high school hero instead of just another guy working at a factory. The play examines the conflict between one\u2019s obligations and one\u2019s real desires, suggesting that being true to one may necessitate abandonment of the other. In the \u201cGlass Menagerie\u201d the characters have failed to escape enslavement, thus, losing the chance for a fulfilling existence."
"The nuclear family is debatably a successful family structure. Regardless of who is asked, whether it be a sociologist, psychologist, or any given individual having grown up in their own biased family environment, each would have their own subjective or objective judgement on whether or not the nuclear family might be the best type for fulfilling the functions of the family."
"It is believed that man lived in the Rocky Mountains about 10,000 years ago. The Ute\u2019s lived in the mountains of West Colorado. As the Arapaho, who were plains Indians who came to the Estes Park frequently in summer to hunt, migrated westwards the Americans moved out from Appalachian [36] . With the arrival of Americans, Indians avoided Estes Park and Grand Lake area. Rufus Sage is the first American to have visited the region. He spent three years exploring the Rockies. Joel Estes, a Kentuckian, was the first settler. He brought his family in 1859 and eventually settled as a farmer near Fort Lupton. A few homes were set up in the upper Colorado Valley in 1879 and by 1880 people moved in to Lulu city where some gold discoveries had been made. A few homes were set up in the upper Colorado Valley in 1879 and by 1880 people moved in to Lulu city where some gold discoveries had been made [37] . In 1883 the town was deserted. As a result of publicity and political pressure, a bill was passed in 1915 and signed by President Wilson to establish the Rocky Mountains National Park the Park\u2019s dedication was conducted in September 4, 19"
"A few miles south of Soledad the Salinas River drops in close to the hillside bank and runs deep and green.\u00a0The water is warm too, for it has slipped twinkling over the yellow sands in the sunlight before reaching the narrow pool.\u201d(Steinbeck 1). Steinbeck is not making just plain ordinary descriptions of this scene-setting, but is revealing a sense of freedom and joy before tragedy and hate that\u2019s burred farther along the book from the sordid aspects of life."
"entered a finality of decision by interpreting the laws with respect to abortion in the light of the various provision of the Constitution of America, which even today is considered a land mark decision that provides the guide line to the principles of abortion and the rights and duties of the individual and the state."
"In his early stripling old ages, Manson remembers one Christmas where wholly he received was a Superman coppice. The kids of the vicinity teased him and made merriment of him for it. So, to acquire even, he took all their ownerships and gathered them at his place. He stacked up some wood and threw the playthings on top and started a fire ( Emmons, 1994 ) ."
"Without their sacrifices, the country that we know today would be drastically changed. Everyday they stand up for what they think is best for our country and its people and are willing to put their lives on the lines for us. Because of these outstanding people, we are a free country with many rights and amendments to keep us safe, protected, and content."
"The idea I contributed to the piece was to revisit the flashbacks in a \u2018what if\u2019 situation, the characters on finding out about Eliot\u2019s death were all deeply sorry and ashamed of the way they behaved towards him. Showing these \u2018what if\u2019 flashbacks I think represented their own thoughts and was effective in the performance. What we could have improved in this piece was the beginning sequence of Eliot doing the \u2018scream\u2019 pose."
"Shakespeare uses a range of ultimatums to interpret typical examples of medieval parents. For example, Lord Capulet frustratingly says to Juliet \u201cI tell thee what; get thee to the church O\u2019Thursday; / Or never look me in the face\u201d and \u201cGaze were you will, you shall not house with me\u201d. This illustrates the ferociousness of Lord Capulet, who will not accept Juliet as his daughter or allow her to live with him unless she agrees to marry Paris,who is very high class ad well known in the society. Medieval fathers brought enormous pressure on their daughters to marry the man he chose unlike parents nowadays would be more considerate to accept their children\u2019s point of view."
"Would often be the reason for a child to be in such a setting, but that\u2019s not the case for many children and families today. Group homes for today can offer children and families a better-quality way of depending on the needs individually. There are many concerns that are impacted by the families being supported in issues, laws, legislation, or programs."
"You have the right for your voice to be heard no matter who you are. \u201c\u00b7 what will that make me? The thug ghetto girl with the drug dealer? What will my teachers think about me? My friends? \u201d (Thomas 113) After witnessing the death of her friend, she knew that her and Khalil would be stereotyped. Starr fears that people will think of her a poor, ghetto, black girl just by judging where she is from. Because of today\u2019s society, it is very unfortunate how accurate her thoughts are. Although the novel celebrates blackness and embracing who you are, Angie still wants to show her reader\u2019s that you are uniquely you no matter what color skin you may be in and your life equally matters."
"Life isn\u2019t easy. There isn\u2019t a cheat sheet or instructions to tell you how to sail through life smoothly. Although life has its ups and downs, there are experiences that will keep you afloat. I believe happiness is a choice and anyone has the ability to create lasting happiness for themselves. There was a time in my life when things were grimm. As nice as it would have been to have my very own \u201ceasy button\u201d from Staples, I learned that people and my environment can make life worthwhile."
"One difference between the Burgess model and Mann\u2019s is that local government played a role in slum clearance and gentrification. This led to large council estates which took the working/low incomes to the city edge. This is the opposite to Burgess model as the working class are situated in the inner city zone."
"Parents and children alike can come together through the use of this space and build a camaraderie as a result of this project. The proposed playground will provide a positive, interactive surrounding which is expected to become a big factor in the progression of the children\u2019s development while also enhancing their social skills. Bringing the children of the community together helps to create more interpersonal relationships and build a closer, more family-like community."
"Northern Ireland in recent years has seen many different cultures coming for a better life or because we have not enough appropriately qualified people to fill some jobs this very evident in the healthcare sector were staff from the Philippines, India, Africa and Eastern Europe have been employed to overcome our staff shortages, our health service could have been threatened without their help. Many things have changed in Northern Ireland since we have had so many different cultures bringing many benefits, which I will discuss below."
"She wants for people to look past one\u2019s skin color, but rather focus on the true person they are within. Starr uses her community and family to bring a change to society injustice within Garden Heights, so that they may live in a world of equality. Starr uses her voice and her community support as an advocate to show that all lives are equally important despite any circumstances."
"She is of African descent and writes poetry with impressive eloquence and fights for her liberation of her people through poetry. Phillis subjectively gives meaning to Ferguson\u2019s essay of \u2018Race\u2019 in regards that studying race incorporates an in-depth analysis of freedom and the ability of each to acquire and utilize knowledge. The political and economic constructs of race lack to apply epistemology of the races. In a way, to understand race accurately, it requires a subjective racial differentiation that excludes violence inscribed in the historical context of the preconceived notions of the African American race."
"Moreover, he said that there were too many Hispanics taking away jobs and making San Bernardino look bad by having so many illegals living in it. As we can notice there is tension between racial groups and consequently, we are all affected. In daily life situations divisions like these occur because of stereotypes and intolerance that overwhelm our community. Another situation that reflects stereotypes in daily life includes checkpoint locations by the police. In suburban areas where the majority of the population is white, checkpoints are rare to nonexistent because those communities are made up of \u201cthe best\u201d race: the Caucasian."
"Currently over 95,000 women are incarcerated in U. S. prisons, another 70,000 in our jails. The women\u2019s prison population in the U. S. has quadrupled since 1980, largely a result of a war on drugs that has translated into a war on women and the poor generally. African-American women have been hardest hit by this increase. They are 14. 5 percent of the women in the U. S. population, but they constitute 52. 2 percent of the women in prison (Corrections Statistics). Poor young women of color, most of whom are mothers, are locked in old overcrowded prisons, serving lengthy sentences for drug offenses and petty property crimes."
"In addition, marriage age should be increased due to the high risks in early marriage. This is because age has been the most consistent and clear predictor of marital failure for years. According to Vivian E. Hamilton (2012), less than 30% of married couple who entered marriage at the age 25 and above, end in divorce. Meanwhile, approximately 70% of married couples who entered marriage before the age of 18 that end in divorce. The reasons for early marriages instability is due to the cognitive capacity of adolescent to understand the nature of marriage and the consent to enter marriage yet forget their lack in relationship skills and emotional maturity required in nowadays marriage. This can be said due to the incapability of the youngsters to think through over something as they would not think the impact but rather make a decision blindly to satisfy themselves. This is not merely the children fault as their cognitive process is put into a limit due to their age, lack of experience and knowledge, and also their problem-solving skills. Also, the absence in mutual negotiation or decision making between the partner is also the reason for underage marriage is at risk. There is no doubt that these young wives cannot make a decision in their marriage or engage in mutual negotiation with their adult husbands which lead to emotional disturbances, sexual abuse and domestic violence (Population Council Report, 2003). Hence, it can be seen that marriage age should be raised, so that high risk in underage marriage can be decreased."
"The Gilded Age, or as it is commonly referred to as, the era of corruption, took place in 1877 to 1900. This time period was most effectively portrayed in the novel and movie, The Gangs of New York, which was written by Herbert Asbury. The Gangs of New York focused on a time of politicalcorruption during a period of massive increase in immigration in New York. In this essay I will discuss three themes: immigration, Political machines, and bad situations, that helped contribute to corruptions long vibrant history."
"There is marriage counseling, family counseling, career counseling, mental health counseling, substance abuse counseling, debt counseling, child development counseling and grief counseling, to name a few. Diversity means differences such as different religious beliefs, different cultural traditions, music, art, dancing etc. (Patchell & Broussard,2009,p88) In the context of society and culture, diversity is usually mentioned in discussing multicultural societies. What do people from other cultures contribute when they migrate and become part of a new society."
"Physical health would always be followed by psychological health. It is important to know that child marriage does not only affect physically but it also affects mentally. According to Nour (2006), during childbirth, there is a possibility of young mothers to face fistulas. Fistulas happened due to the force from the fetus\u2019s head on the vagina wall that causes tissue necrosis. This is because their bones are not fully ready for pregnancy and delivery. Fistulas will cause fecal or urinary incontinence and peroneal nerve palsy that lead to embarrassment and resulting depression. Other than that, \u201cbride abduction\u201d is a practice of marrying female adolescents without their approval in Kyrgyzstan. Some brides that were abducted are as young as 12 years old. In some cases, the bride will be brought to the abductor\u2019s house and raped. The purpose of doing so was to make the girl feel humiliated of herself and unable to return to her parents\u2019 house (Miller, 2015). According to Alanen (2016), some victims feeling extremely isolated and depressed that they decided to commit suicide at the end as an escape from the miserable life."
"In uncomfortable times, we are solely responsible for how we choose to behave in response. Self-respect works hand in hand with knowing what to and what not to take part in, and not purposely putting oneself in a position that will be degrading toward their character. With that last thought in mind, it is very crucial that someone can trust their own intuition. Respect and trust are two words that very easily coincide, and definitely rely on each other for validation. If you were to think of a person that you have utmost respect for, you would trust them wouldn\u2019t you? Trust is the element of having faith in the fact that someone will carry through with what they intend to, and a person with a lot of self-respect should hold themselves to that standard."
"Jim\u2019s relationship to Hcuk throughout the novel changes drastically from its shallow beginning. Both Jim and Huckleberry share similar traits: neither are formally educated, both share good instincts and intelligence, and lastly, they are both estranged from society. This makes them both already a good fit for one another. From the moment that Jim and Huckleberry meet on Jackson\u2019s island, his whole attitude towards him changes once they begin to have a more symbiotic relationship. This is interaction is written with Huck relying on Jim for his knowledge, instincts, and his general help with the task at hand. Regardless of the circumstances, Jim is able to bring a prior experience or tidbit of information that can aid them. On the other hand, Jim relies on Huck as his only hope to become a free man, and his source for hunting knowledge and impulsive attitude. Once they reach this equal ground, the majority of Huckleberry\u2019s prejudice towards the black race as a whole, and most importantly Jim, completely disappears. Although Huckleberry may have been able to rid his mind of this impartial preconception to black people, he still struggles with thoughts about whose property is whose. Huckleberry still retains these thoughts during his internal conflict about whether or not to continue harboring a fugitive slave. If word of his wrongdoings were to be discovered, he could be outcasted within his community."
"\u2018\u2026What is man that you are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him? You made him a little lower then the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honour. You made him ruler over the works of your hands; you put everything under his feet.\u2019 (Psalm 8:4-6)"
"Also because she isn\u2019t called by a name, it makes her feel unwanted since she has almost no ability to feel fulfilled as an individual. Leaving her nameless also shows how the men on the ranch feel about women in general, especially Curley\u2019s wife. I also think her lack of a name is simply rooted in realism. It could be the way that the workers refer to her simply because they do not know her name. Another reason why nobody referred to her by her name could be because they were afraid of Curley himself. Even if the men knew her name, maybe they didn\u2019t dare use it for fear of offending Curley because of his hotheadedness; so they played it safe. Leaving Curley\u2019s wife nameless could possible reveal that Steinbeck was making a feminist point by withholding her name."
"Examples are: Ageism: research shows that older people are denied access to the full range of mental health services that are available to younger adults. This particularly disadvantages people with dementia who are often over 65 and in need of mental health support. There are also widespread, mistaken assumptions that dementia is merely \u201cgetting old\u201d, rather than a serious disease. This has led to unequal treatment for people with dementia, including poor rates of diagnosis and a lack of appropriate services. Abuse: Abuse is a serious infringement of the Human Rights Act and has a severe impact on quality of life. People with dementia are particularly vulnerable to abuse. Impaired mental capacity increases the risk of abuse and a person\u2019s dementia can make it harder to detect when abuse is occurring."
"The organizations where I work challenge discrimination and exclusion in both policy and practice. Staffs should regularly be reminded the importance of challenge discrimination and exclusion in day to day practice. In looking at this model I have found that many people have views that based on discrimination and prejudice they are embedded in today\u2019s society, the attitudes and the surrounding environment often focuses on what a person lacks in terms of disability and focuses on condition or illness or a person\u2019s lack of ability. To combat this prejudice within making space we use person centred care planning it is my responsibility to promote the use of this and to ensure that the support workers who deliver it are fully trained to do so."
"As seen in the book Of Mice and Men, author John Steinbeck uses a range of different names for his character, but as it seems, it is not just a coincidence that they are named this way. Steinbeck uses these specific names to match personality of a character and to show the significance of these characters to the society. Many characters names begin with a C for example Candy, Crooks, Curley, to create a direct reference to \u2018Cain\u2019 a nomad from the bible; who was cursed by God that he would never be able to settle down because of his wrongdoings for power, this signifies that the characters and Cain have a similarity; they are not able to settle down but are forced to keep moving from one area to another."
"Then we see some students that volunteer at the animal shelter and they find that they would never be able to euthanize an animal, so they have to consider finding a different career\u201d (Jensen). Selecting a career is challenging enough, let alone discovering that the career one chose was not the best and having to choose another. Volunteering provides teens with opportunities outside of finding a career that gives them the necessary skills to help them survive the real world."
"The role of man as shown in the society as providing food and security for the family demanded them to work harder. They were given ample of opportunities to climb up the social ladder and prove their manhood. The extent of taking up the roles and standing on the expectations of the society for man became so troublesome that in the process, they burdened woman. For example, In India, the dowry system where the bride has to pay the groom and give him dowry became the cause of death of many women. This I believe is merely because of society\u2019s assigned role to being a man. \u201cBesides, while a large dowry raises the prestige of the bride among her affine, more importantly, a small one can make her life miserable and result in extreme torture and in many cases her murder (e.g. through burn injuries) or suicides CITATION Gee18 l 1033 (Dang, 2018). While agreeing with Geetika Dang in her research \u2018Why Dowry Deaths Have Rise in India? I can say that woman have been and is at volatile state limiting them to perform better than man. They are consider as liabilities and someone one whose life should move in and around her husband and family."
"What is there is a complication early in the pregnancy that requires complete bed rest or hospitalization. If this were to happen, where would her income come from? She would have to drop out of school. She would then have six months to get back into school or she would have to begin the repayment of her student loans. How can she do any of this without financial support? There are several ethical views on abortion. All the different views would explain why or why not to have an abortion. Abortion can be a controversial ethical topic. No one person will ever have the same stance on the topic. It is one of those topics when you just have to agree to disagree. You will just have to respect and listen to the opinions that others have on this ethical issue."
"Overall, George + Lennie, Curley\u2019s Wife, Crooks and Candy are affected by the harsh reality of loneliness which Steinbeck presents emotionally through setting and their own disabilities in 1930\u2019s America- whether it\u2019s racism, sexism or not able to perform practical skills. Even with their American Dream, Steinbeck shows that this only makes them the more vulnerable against the wide world ahead of them within a lonely town known as \u2018Soledad\u2019. We see this isolation come altogether in Chapter 4 when the ranch hands go into town on Saturday night to ease their loneliness with alcohol and women. Similarly, Lennie and Candy go into Crook\u2019s room to find someone to talk to, and later Curley\u2019s wife comes for the same reason \u2013 Loneliness."
"Part of achieving this goal is to make sure the children interact with each of the other throughout the day; I will achieve this by planning activities where the children can mingle and have different friends at each station. I will also make sure that everyone participates in whole class games and other fun activities that promote teamwork. I will make sure that I am a good example by communicating and being friendly with each child\u2019s parent/care-giver."
"Grace Nichols was longing for a cultural identity in Britain and she tends to describe Britain negatively and the Caribbean positively. This is why throughout the poems she applies her own dialect of Creole, which is the official dialect of the Caribbean. She also uses Creole because she feels as though she should preserve it. She maintains that her Caribbean language is \u2018genuinely exciting\u2019 and that Creole\u2019s aspects are very vivid which concludes her to believe that there is no equivalent in the English language."
"Have you ever felt so left out or unwanted that you approach anyone available whether they care about you or not? When a person needs someone to talk to but there is no one there, what does one do? In John Steinbeck\u2019s, Of Mice and Men, Curley\u2019s wife is very lonely and feels extremely useless. She feels that the only way she can get attention is by going around and flirting with guys. Although everyone see\u2019s Curley\u2019s wife as a \u201cwhore\u201d who just wants to seduce guys, her true desire is to have someone she can go to who makes her feel loved."
"you always killed \u2019em. \u201d All this about the dead mouse is significant to the manslaughter of Curley\u2019s wife, whom due to the sexist character of the male workers on the ranch has not been given a name. The ensuing incident that makes George just puncture out in anger is when they are having beans for supper, Lennie, like a little child wants ketchup even though there is none, \u201cI like beans with ketchup. \u201d To which George replies, \u201cwell, we ain\u2019t got no ketchup. \u201d Minutes later Lennie repeats, \u201cI like \u2019em with ketchup. \u201d To this juvenile behaviour of Lennie, George bursts open even saying things he regrets later, \u201c\u2026."
"In my opinion, I think it\u2019s good that religion promotes racial harmony, as it shows that they have respect for all religions other than their own. Equality is a problem in today\u2019s society, so religion stepping in creates real harmony. But I do see the negative points, as I have experience racism towards my faith and my friends because they are different from each other. Racism is everywhere, that\u2019s because of peoples opinions formed from personal experiences or what they have been told or taught. It is important for all religions to get on; otherwise the world would have been in major conflict."
"How can a law be effective if the law has loopholes and no ability to do its duty? The solution to this is to hold individuals accountable when the system fails. Adequate background checks are the key to this ongoing gun control issue. To be diligent in protecting the public from increasing gun violence, the government needs to step up and create a law that is not necessarily an invasion of privacy but a protection of human kind from these weapons of destruction. With that said, the overall gun violence will unfortunately continue to be a regularity as current gun laws are not eliminating the root of the problem."
"Because of the interpretation of history which can be viewed in The Birth of a Nation, the idea of the film as a historical epic is another issue which places it in a position of controversy. Similar to the Dunning School of historiography, the film asserts that the Ku Klux Klan restored order to the post-war South, or as Steven Mintz summarises: \u201cReconstruction was a disaster, blacks could never be integrated into white society as equals, and the violent action of the Klu Klux Klan were justified to re-establish honest government\u201d. As a result of the historical re-enactments, such as the inclusion of battle scenes and cited sources, the film acts like a historical text which raises many problems due to its biased approach. Dangerously, it appears authentic and almost of documentary quality as it seems to reconstruct an important period in history, not only including the civil war but including the events building up to and following it. This realistic appearance proved problematic as it made it easier for the audience to fall under the influence of the narrative and ideologies put forward by Griffith. For example, President Woodrow Wilson reportedly said of the film: \u201cIt\u2019s like writing history with lightning. And my only regret is that it is all terrible true\u201d. One obvious opposition to the advertised authenticity of the film is evident however through the black characters being played by white actors in blackface which makes it clear that even on the surface it does not present the viewer with an accurate account of history. This idea is supported by the fact that many historians such as W. E. B. Du Bois disputed the interpretation when it was released and most historians today agree with them, arguing that African Americans were loyal and contributed during the Civil War years and Reconstruction. The film\u2019s depictions of mass paramilitary actions by the Klan are also unsupported as there are no records of historical events equivalent to those portrayed by Griffith. Although The Birth of a Nation can be considered a historical epic, its twisting of history highlights the dangerous capabilities of filmmakers who can weave harmful ideologies into their work. By basing its narrative on historical events and through the genuine appearance of the film, viewers are more likely to believe and adopt the views communicated through The Birth of a Nation as the world of the film and the events it depicts become much more plausible and convincing. This film, viewed as an authentic account of history, would have us believe that in the past the fair white slave owners were wronged by the Northerners who freed the obedient and loyal slaves and allowed them to become the wicked masters. Needless to say this is an example of a historical epic which must be examined with caution as its authenticity and historical accuracy are both highly questionable."
"She asks Juliet to love Paris without even knowing what Juliet\u2019s feelings for Paris are. It is revealed Juliet\u2019s mother \u201cwas a mother much upon these years/That [Juliet] is now a maid\u201d (1.3.75-77), and instead of imposing that type of marriage she forces it upon her daughter. Throughout Romeo and Juliet, Capulet performs his duties as a father including disciplining Juliet and marrying her off. Whilst, Lady Capulet ignores how Juliet feels, and pesters her about loving Paris, giving her pressure to adore someone she has no feelings for. Unlike her husband, Lady Capulet neglects her parental duties and forces the nurse to take of Juliet, distancing Juliet from her mother. While Lord Capulet is uneasy at the sight of her daughter being married so young, Lady Capulet did not have the same opinion of her lover."
"According to the Malay proverb, \u201cHow the mold, that\u2019s gravy\u201d, parents also play a very important role in shaping positive values in children\u2019s self. Children\u2019s personalities reflect their parents \u2018second attitude. Values such as honesty, tolerance, justice, respect for older people and civic awareness need to be implemented. In addition, parents need to encourage children to participate in programs such as the government-run PLKN and RIMUP. In this program, children can interact with students of different races and backgrounds while also getting to know new friends during the program. Parents also take the children to participate in activities organized by neighbouring community associations in residential areas such as gotong-royong activities and cultural nights. By participating in these activities, children will become more exposed to the cultures of the people while also interacting and getting to know more about the diversity of society in Malaysian society."

"Although it can be argued that immigration is bad because they are taking peoples jobs away and causing racial problems. I believe that immigrants are good, because I\u2019m a food lover without them there wouldn\u2019t have been different types of food. There wouldn\u2019t be different cultures to learn about, and there wouldn\u2019t be different product coming from around the world."
"For example, if your hanging out with friends and they are drinking, smoking, or stealing and they ask you can you join, your first thought would be \u201cwhat should I say\u201d and you instantly say no. Then your friends began to call you lame, scary, or fake, and feel down on yourself so in order for you to feel better and feel as if your \u201cfitting in\u201d then you will change your mind and say yes to whatever criminal activity they are engaging in."
"It\u2019s a negative social behavior to people with different cultures and races. This is one of the major issues the world is facing. Immigration can be a social issue, where racism is used to exploit feelings and express woes of the local population towards the immigrants (Nittle 2011). According to the New York Times; a group a West Africans migrated to Rocky Mountains, North America in search of economic opportunity were involved in a disagreement with Wal-Mart, accusing it of discriminatory actions, they argued that they were been dismissed because supervisors wanted them to give their jobs to locals."
"This media has made migrant Filipinos aware of historical events in the Philippines and has showcased Filipino culture and tradition as a source of national pride. On the other hand, Filipino-Americans still face many difficulties in the assimilation process like hate crimes, workplace discrimination and state policies that have negative impact to Filipinos (Ciria-Cruz and Yuchengco, 1998). Though, the culture of determination among Filipinos remains to be intact and they persevere to stay in foreign land to give back glory to their families in the Philippines and somehow help elevate the failing economy of their country."
"The dream was never going to become true because inevitably Lennie would end up in big trouble and jeopardise the dream for George. The time at which the novel is set would make Lennie feel very lonely if he didn\u2019t have George as he would be either locked away into a mental asylum or killed for getting into trouble. George travelling around with Lennie has made George quite lonely, as it is definitely a one-way partnership, with Lennie reaping all the benefits and George not being able to settle down anywhere as if Lennie does something wrong they have to move."
"In addition to complications after the procedure, a woman runs a high risk of death during the procedure which increases based on how far along she is in the pregnancy. People promote reasons abortion should be illegal are passionate about God, life, and health. These people know how serious of a health risk this action is for soul and body. Though no sin is unforgivable, it is unforgettable."
"They bring a new ulture in America, which some most Americans embrace while others reject it. Those whom embrace it cook less at home and order Pizza\u2019s which is an Italian Meal, Chinese food or Taco Bell, the Mexican Restaurant. There so many things we don\u2019t stop to realize or take for granted but are there thanks to immigration. Immigration is in our daily lives, wherever we go, we have to deal with it. It has become part of the American living. Another example would be Sedano\u2019s the Cuban Supermarket. This Fernandez 3 company easily provides Jobs for the Hispanic immigrant population."
"Following the business models of former startups like Uber, which is now worth $62 billion dollars, these CEOs aim to do the same with each company. Providing set \u201crules\u201d and regulations to give their product a sense of safety during use, the main goal, in the end, is money. While these scooters have very quickly developed a dark reputation, when operated properly, they have proven to be very useful and economically attainable for nearly anyone in need of a quick and affordable way to commute short distances. The original intention for the product was to eliminate the last mile of one\u2019s commute to work. After taking another form of transportation whether it be a personal vehicle or public transport of any sort, the scooters serve their intended purpose in getting each individual from drop off to check-in, as quickly as possible."
"It has even been estimated that the average American tells 11 lies per week. Children are typically stereotyped as innocent and pure however the normalization of lying has now come to the concern of many as our children are instantly picking up this negative aspect and implementing this habit into their life at an early age. Growing up we are taught that the most important value any human being can possess is honesty, therefore making it necessary, to tell the truth no matter the circumstances."
"One of the editors, Eugene Reinal, has won doubtful glory, having complained, that cannot understand in any way that lunatic Caulfield. Later Salinger has presented the book in publishing house \u201cLittle Brown \u201c. Editor-in-chief John Vudbern has reasonably refrained from questions about mental health of the hero. The novel has been published in July, 1951, since then it has been sold more than sixty millions copies."
"A label removes people groups pride and singularity. In health and social care, it isn\u2019t permitted to label clients since it interferes with the measure of care that clients receive, also this could cause a hindrance for treatment towards the clients as they might not have any desire to treat them appropriately because of judgment."
"From a practical perspective, the use of animal experiments guarantees the safety of humans. In order to ascertain whether drugs and other consumer goods are safe for humans, the use of animals becomes justified. Taylor (132) even supports this idea by indicating that very few animals are sacrificed during such experiments which help to not only save millions of people, but also animals. Opponents of this claim have however cited cases of animal suffering and deaths because of ineffective experimental procedures. Taylor (120) highlights a critical perspective regarding this issue by indicating that \u201cOf course, Jennie was not human; she was a squirrel monkey. To do such a research on a human being would be immoral. The question then is, what justifies using a monkey?\u201d Other commentators have also indicated the idea of injecting animals with toxins in the name of scientific advancement."
"India is a big country comprising many racial groups with a great number of spoken languages and dialects. There are several religions and sects. These are reflected in their customs, rituals, dresses and festivals. Indian is the cradle of many cultures. In spite of the diversities, the people are united. Though several foreign invaders attacked India, none succeeded in destroying the basic Indian culture. One the contrary, it absorbed the good qualities of the new cultures and emerged as a richer culture after these Sikh religions."

"Deforestation of Colombia is a dangerous act to the environment. Colombia\u2019s forests are the home of 55,000 plant species and 358 mammal species, 15 percent of the world\u2019s primates. Currently, 1,000 plants species and 24 mammals\u2019 species are threatened with extinction largely because of mass deforestation. Each year, a total of 1.5 to 2.2 million acres is lost to deforestation. At this rate, Colombia\u2019s woodlands will be depleted in 40 years. Already one-third of this country\u2019s original forest lands have felled. Colombia\u2019s Pacific region consists of lush rainforests and contains most of the country\u2019s natural resources."
"This idea has been highlighted by the increasing number of young second-generational Asian youth identifying themselves as British Muslims, as opposed to other identities, such as Pakistani. The revival of Islam as a world religion has led to many scholars such as Jacobson (1997), arguing that religion has become a source of identity that crosses over different cultures and ethnicities. \u201cIslam is important\u2026 because it is about how you think, not what country you are from\u201d (Jacobson, 1997:245 cited in Abercrombie et al, 2006:239).

"First will be warren\u2019s stance on the morality of abortion. She argues that we can\u2019t definitively show that premature birth is allowable if the embryo has a privilege to life. T\u2019s contention fails in that the AA may contend that one is in charge of the child with the exception of in assault cases.

"Participative observation this where the practitioner takes part in the activity, this means that the practitioner will be watching what the children do during the planned activity and they will take part in the activity themselves. For an example the practitioner might plan to do a group activity where they let each child join in and take turns for an example each child saying how many bears there is. Here the practitioner might demonstrate first what the children need to do in the activity and then they will observe the child doing the group activity."

"Finally, Beneatha also shows a high sense of pride throughout her character. She makes a few comments proving she is a person with a high sense of pride. Asagai also is quoted for saying \u201cshe prides herself on being independent\u201d. This proves that she has a high sense of pride since she is a very independent person. She is soo independent that she plans to go to Africa with Asagai. This proves that Beneatha is a person that has a high sense of pride."
"It is important for women to have access to these sources in order to prevent them from having an unexpected pregnancy. According to Planned Parenthood (n.d.)

"Despite the fact that xenophobic and racist attitudes and actions have attacked the moral fiber of our country for generations, these views persist in today\u2019s society. These negative beliefs can be attributed to fear and a lack of understanding among American citizens with regard to foreign cultures. Instead of being so quick to blame immigrants for the country\u2019s problems, American citizens and the American government should work together to cease the tolerance of racist activities, and instead strive to promote cultural appreciation and understanding."
"If one does not accept that a foetus is a human being, then the woman may have it removed from her body, similarly to having a kidney stone taken out. But if the foetus is believed to be a person, then I do not think any argument of ownership can hold up against the soundness of the given examples."
"According to The Atlantic, Chicago is the most impacted area dealing with police brutality. Illinois governor, Otto Kerner, did an investigation of racial violence in the late 1960s. He wanted to understand the causes of what creates racial violence in the first place. Some of the problems found in American culture was unequal job opportunities, poverty, and inadequate education for the African American community. Although the study was done a long time ago, the same factors are still an issue in today\u2019s society."
"Wither or not Barbauld\u2019s writing was affected by the Boston Tea Party movement or not, the two happening in the same year seems to be enough of a connection to assume this was an effect. In 1785, the same year \u201cTo a Mouse\u201d was written, Scotland was under the beginning of the highland clearances. Before 1785 many families and clans were getting relocated to other parts of Scotland so that the land could be used to raise big black sheep instead. The success of relocating humans for the use of their land became so popular that the evil countess of Sutherland used the threat of clearances to blackmail every young man on her vast estates to enlist in her regiment."
"1.2As part of the school policies every child in the school has a right to feel safe.so to fulfil this they are kept in a school which is protected and has high security. Also the parents if they have any worries about their kids safety or any misconceptions they have the access and permission to come in the school and have an appointment with the head teacher to discuss their issues. Parents are expected to encourage their children to have good behaviour at the school.to show they have made contributions to the school they do have head teachers award\u2019 or worker of the week\u2019 which do show and reflect both the head teachers and child\u2019s contribution. The children should develop their social and emotional skills at school for their future this can be done by motivating them and encouraging them to work harder and likewise praising them when good is done. They also can do more group work so they know how to work with different people and treat others nicely. Furthermore the children to need to know and recognize limits and boundaries when they do certain things and should acknowledge that there are consequences for doing something wrong.1.3The staff all should have the same rules that they follow so they treat every child in the school fairly and equally. Also all the staff in the school must be aware of the school policies so in a situation it is dealt with care and fairness. If these are done the child doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s being treated differently or discriminated for his colour, gender, cultural belief etc. But if in the child\u2019s class two children are in the same trouble and one gets treated differently than the other child that gets in more trouble will feel low and upset which sometimes can cause anxiety issues which can affect their further life. Also when they get treated equally the children are more focused which will make progress in their education.2.1Also you should not be aggressive towards them or have a horrible attitude towards them as this will not make them listen to you. you should say please\u2019 and thank you\u2019 to show them the respect you have for them so it encourages them to be polite too to others .Sometimes if the child always likes doing bad and we choose to ignore it(only when its minor!)And just focus on rewarding the good students then they will understand that they will get attention when they do well so this motivates them to drop the negative behaviour and start doing well.2.2There can be a poster which underlines the appropriate behaviour in the class and which type of behaviour is not allowed this will then make it clear what the ground rules are and what is expected from them. One of the rules can be about how to treat others this will show them to respect one another and not doing so is wrong and has consequences. Also when they are good you award them understand and recognise what the wrong is in what they did and also will scare them not to do it again.2.3When they\u2019ve done something good then can use a stuffed dummy on your desk to show the students that they\u2019ve done something good this encourages them and they also get happy as they acknowledge that they\u2019ve done something good. Another awesome way is using a jar of pompoms to reward acts of kindness and good in the classroom. Each child in the class get their own bucket made out of a cup with a pipe cleaner attached as a handle. Whenever a student does something good, he or she is rewarded with a fuzzy pom-pom. When a child\u2019s bucket is filled up to the top the class applauds and praises the student there after he/she gets to dump it into the class bucket .When the class bucket is full the whole class gets a reward. This is a very different strategy as when this happens the students among themselves can promote each other to do good as they know together they all need to contribute to get the end prize.2.4To promote consistent good behaviour in the classroom you can set of golden rules and enforce these all day every day. Make sure the rules are positive not negative and describe the behaviour you would like to see rather than the behaviour you wouldn\u2019t. Make sure all practitioners are aware of the behaviour management policy held by the setting. Share expectations with parents so everyone is working towards achieving the same goals for the child. Remember children are not always able to tell the difference between when something is acceptable and when it isn\u2019t. To avoid the child being in trouble unnecessarily follow the same consistent rules at all times. Ensure everyone is dealing with incidents of unwanted behaviour in the same way following the policies set by the setting. If behaviour is being dealt with in a certain way make sure everyone is aware of this and are also using the same technique of giving consequences to all the children.2.5To be an effective role model you would have to promote good behaviour skills so to apply this you would have to regularly check the behaviour policies, as this explains properly what behaviour is needed and how to promote good behaviour and also how to tackle all different behaviour scenarios. Also having consistent teaching promotes good behaviour in the class this will give a good impact on the students. Another method is that the teacher should have a wide range of different awards as this will be effective because the children will be more persuaded to be good and show positive behaviour. Due to this the child might even show positive behaviour out school grounds. Moreover you should have good interactive skills as this will create a good relationship with the students and also makes the students to have more confidence.3.1You should set ground rules as soon as possible and also abide by them at all times in order for the child to know where they stand.do not make empty threats as this supports and encourages inappropriate behaviour. You should also have regular talks to the student in order for them to stay on tracks and also acknowledge what consequences are to certain actions. Sometimes it is good to remind them of the awards they can get if they stay good.3.2If a student was to show inappropriate behaviour then you should not give empty threats you should always fulfil any consequences you say to the students this will help the students as a warning that when a bad action is done there is severe consequences and they will not just get away with it .Also when a child does misbehave then you should not go and get another teacher to sort them out first try yourself to sort it out as if you don\u2019t then you might lose your students trust and respect. Apply rules and boundaries consistently and fairly according to the situation.3.3Children need boundaries in order to learn appropriate behaviour. They need the boundaries to be applied consistently and fairly because if it isn\u2019t then the children will do whatever they want. Inconsistent and unfair consequences will confuse them and may lead to behavioural issues. Sometimes if the issue is sorted out unfairly between children then they can start having disputes between each other.3.4You can provide a journal of you past incidents on how you dealt with the children when they showed inappropriate behaviour this is a very effective method on how to help out other colleagues. You can also do this by helping out a teacher in the playground when an incident occurs and helping her/him to control the scene. Another way is also when another member of staff needs another staff to have a one to one with the naughty child so they understand from another perspective what wrong action they\u2019ve done this generally helps more as they don\u2019t feel they\u2019re getting picked on by their form tutor.3.5There are times when as a teaching assistant you will find it hard to difficult to handle certain situations in such cases it is sometimes better to refer such situations to another member of staff or the child\u2019s parents as they might be more experienced in handling the situation. An example is when the child is a danger to themselves then it might be best to make a more senior staff to deal with the issue. If you think the child is acting differently or acting odd then you might want to report this to a safeguarding officer as they might be getting abused at home or having any other rough issues also when you first notice the odd behaviour then should be reported straight away keeping the child\u2019s safety in consideration. If you think the student is being harmful or dangerous to other children you should tell the form tutor or the parents.4.1Sometimes you should make patterns like some children may act differently and have behavioural issues in certain environments. You can do this by spending time with the child in different areas to see where it triggers them if its example bullying in the playground or canteen etc. After this when you think defiantly you have worked a pattern or connection somewhere then you can inform the class form tutor and then it can be resolved in the proper manner. This is an effective method as because you know what triggers them off then you can attempt to avoid it the next time it can occur. If children are not making any progress in their assessments then a report should be made and a progress check so it can be discussed with the parents of the child in order for the child to understand the severity of the situations.4.2 If you are doing a little small investigation on the child regarding their behavioural issues then the child\u2019s name should be kept anonymous in all your evidence and the child\u2019s matters should not be discussed with anyone out of school only can be shared with a professional member of staff in the school. Also when you deal with an issue you should read the school regulations and then proceed you should also not be aggressive at the child no matter the circumstances. Furthermore the school has a no touch policy which should be abided by in all situations.4.3Teaching assistants should be working along the teacher of the class to provide additional help according to the plan. When dealing and accessing behaviour you should consider the other children\u2019s safety in the class. The schools safety and health policies and procedures should always be followed. Young children are not usually aware of difficult or dangerous situations so when you are dealing with them it is important for you to explain the consequences as well. Also before anything does happen you should plan measures of the other children\u2019s safety when something does occur. Just in case something does happen then a school nurse or health officer should always be available.4.4It is important to respond appropriately when dealing with inappropriate behaviours according to the school policies and procedures. The more you observe a child the more you get to know about the child and what triggers them. This knowledge will help you when the inappropriate behaviour occurs. Written records should be kept for future use. You should find the opportunity to talk to the teacher about your observations and say what you felt led the child to behave in such a way. You should put input in the solutions to what could be done to support the child and prevent this and encourage them to identify what they feel triggers the behaviour they displayed. They need you to encourage them so they understand what impact it plays on the others. Another way of helping the child out is you can set the child behaviour related targets which can be recorded regularly and later the progress can be checked. Similarly, if you have seen in the past what incidents have happened and what the outcome was of the child\u2019s behaviour then you should prevent such situations to occur again.4.5Any children that have regular behavioural issues have regular reports on their progress and behaviour and attendance which gets discussed with the parents. By monitoring and keeping track of the child\u2019s behaviour is really effective as they can evaluate and help the teachers and supports them to notice any bullying, harassment or inappropriate behaviour in the classroom. Acting immediately is very significant as this can affect the wellbeing of young children. So if you do acknowledge the bullying of a student it is unlawful to keep that information to yourself it is important to deal with the situation yourself if you are capable or hand the situation over to another senior member of staff. You can call in the parents of the child that is in the wrong and present the appropriate punishment to them to compensate for the action they\u2019ve done/what harm they\u2019ve caused to other fellow classmates.5.1The child could have a one to one feedback session with a teacher that knows him/her well so the child feels comfortable. Then the teacher should discuss and ask the child to make a list of all the good and bad acts they did that day, this is a very easy and constructive method for a child to understand that when good is done then the outcomes are much better and their academic progress is a lot better. Also they can recognise and acknowledge that some actions they did were bad and what the consequences are to them and also you should explain to them what impact it causes to others. Example maybe the child was being disruptive in lesson this makes the other children\u2019s attention span to decrease therefore leading to decrease their academic progress and achieving lower than what they are capable of.5.2Children need to be aware of all the policies sand procedures of the school so they abide by them in order for them to academically progress.to gain this behaviour strategies are put into place. Also for the children to be obedient they also want their voice to be heard and taken into consideration so this means we have to support their ideas and listen to them and accepting their ideas also giving back the respect they give us. Also it is good to mention the behaviour rules and consequences regularly just to keep them reminded and focused on track.Giving students behaviour targets and depending on their behaviour will be given a set of targets which will be reviewed on a daily basis. Which means they be put on daily report every day where the child has to get the report signed by every lesson teacher and the teacher leaves a comment whether the child has met their target or not ,depending on this they will have a certain amount of days to stay on the report till their behaviour improves.5.3Also when the child has done well sometimes it\u2019s good for them to hear your praises. Sometimes you can praise them to another teacher or send them a postcard home explaining their good act and also you can give them a good phone call home to inform the parents that their child is improving etch this promotes good behaviour as the child feels like he is being appreciated. But if a person is bullying someone else I would immediately take the child out of the class and take them to a senior member to resolve the issues and also bring the person being bullied and make him justify himself and apologize to the child that\u2019s getting oppressed. However if it is the case that the bullying is severe then the child\u2019s parents will have to be called in and further consequences will be taken. If there is a problem regarding their attendance then I would make a phone call home and see why the attendance is poor and sort the issues out.5.4The education and inspections act made clear rules with schools about dealing with behaviour and discipline of the children. This includes promoting good behaviour with the reward schemes alongside any negative behaviour and the sanctions. Having a good relationship between the teacher and the students keeps a good flow when doing group work as the work is easily understood. Also reporting and giving back feedback to other teachers and colleagues is promoting good behaviour. Giving small reward when a minor act of good is done is very effective as the child feels good about themselves as this makes them more motivated to learn"
"The language in The Trout and Crackling Day are very different. The language used in The Trout is very descriptive compared to the Crackling Day. Also the language is used to describe different things. In The Trout the surroundings are described in a very artistic way \u201c\u2026 a lofty midnight tunnel of smooth\u201d and \u201csinewy branches\u201d. However in the Crackling Day the language used to describe the surroundings and settings is very plain. It is almost non-existent. Instead language is used to describe their thoughts on the atmosphere around them."
"I do think that their roles are consistent with the traditional portrayal of a Latina woman in the USA. In the article, \u201cVisiting the Mexican American Family: Tortilla Soup as Culinary Tourism,\u201d the author states, \u201cThe Latina women were portrayed as being hypersexual and exotic, who, like the \u201cbeautified images of food\u00b7invite a touristic gaze (Linderfield, 2007, p. 311)\u2026 \u2018The daughters were light-skinned and looked and acted like middle class Whites, \u201cimplying that Latinas who fit into mainstream speaking patterns and behavior codes can become a part of mainstream white culture.\u201d She describes my feelings perfectly. Although they are seen as career driven women, which does demonstrate change in the stereotype, they are still hypersexualized and whitewashed."
"The homework, which everyone thinks that it would directly cause many benefits to students themselves, is also proved to be the unconscious cause of broader negative impacts to a lot of learners in the school if it were given with an extra quantity. The first negative feedback caused by doing homework is found in terms of health issues which are included both stress and sleep deprivation. Moreover, the conflicts within family are another result of an excessive homework which most people have never taken into account before."
", or a Dentist until I moved to Seattle. My sibling and I were all separated once we arrived at the orphanage. I was at the orphanage for 4 years from what I had read in my paperwork. From what I could remember, I was young when I was put in the orphanage that I was deprived of a loving/caring relationship with any adult. Being hugged as a child was something I would try to avoid at all costs. Unfortunately I was physically abused so every time an adult went to hug me, I was prepared to be hit. The deeper we get into this paper the further our relationship between the child and parents blossoms."
"In this essay, the two nontraditional families show the supportive relationship and strongest family ties. In addition, both of these writings help to form new ideas about untraditional or minority families teaching that nuclear families are not the only type of family that should be respected or considered when it comes to analyzing the closeness and supportiveness of families. Both are the great example of nontraditional families. It shows that the connections between \u201cAn Indian Story\u201d and \u201cLooking for Work\u201d."
"They believe, they are doing best for their children and without their consents, they bond them into marriage contracts. However, they don\u2019t consider that forced marriage affect women and young children adversely. It involves negative situations like threatening behavior, emotional blackmail, physical violence, rape, sexual abuse, suicide and even murder and young children are obviously not in the capacity to handle such pressure. According to a United Nations\u2019 report, between 60 to 80 percent of marriages in Afghanistan are forced marriages."
"You don\u2019t want to create a situation that isn\u2019t necessary so you huddle next to your bed and hope whomever it is takes what they want and leaves. You hear them walking down the hallway toward you. Your bladder nearly lets go. The intruder tries to open your door but luckily you locked it."
"They have not been taught how to communicate with him, how to problem solve when things get hectic, or to develop any coping skills. The core foundation of this therapeutic intervention is that the family joins together to manage the symptoms and to understand the illness itself. The longer the family is in treatment the better and more lasting the effects of treatment are (McFarlane, 2003). Through psychoeducation the family will be a part of the solution rather than a part of the problem. Issues with Joining and Engagement"
"In the book To Kill a Mockingbird, racial discrimination is very prevalent in the character\u2019s hometown, Maycomb. Racism becomes recognizable during Tom Robinson\u2019s trial. Tom is convicted of raping Mayella Ewell, even though Atticus had proven that Tom was innocent and the jury had limited evidence to prove Mayella innocent. Atticus says he has never had a jury consider a black man\u2019s case as they did with Tom\u2019s. The jury knew what was right, but still went with the knowledge that they\u2019ve always known, not trying to challenge it."
"There is an obvious lack of knowledge of contraceptive, sexual assertiveness and low empowering teenage pregnant. Many young women are depressed because they have partial or no support. Honig\u2019s book offers concluded ideas on how mothers who have physical and emotional bonds during pregnancy, demonstrate positive interactions with their newborns."
"However, African Americans are more likely to experience police brutality, compared to other races. The majority killed by police officers are African Americans between the ages of 20-25 years of age. Carbarado mentions many reasons why African Americans are \u201cvulnerable to repeated police interactions.\u201d He mentions how there is \u201cproactive policing\u201d, targeting neighborhoods with high crime areas that have little disorder, \u201cracial segregation\u201d where police target black people who seem \u201cout of place\u201d when they are in neighborhood dominantly white and \u201cracial stereotypes\u201d meaning black people are officers preferred person of interest (Carbarado, pg.163). In 2015, 38 unarmed African-Americans were killed that year, compared to the fewer number of killings, which was 19 for Hispanics that same year."
"3. Avoiding psychiatric consultation. 4. A variety -of trained professionals. 5. Awareness about contraceptives and sterilization. Conflicting decision on abortion law by various courts in the country * Those trained in medicine, philosophy and theology are unable to arrive a consensus as to when life begins. * Constitution does not include the unborn as person. In areas other than criminal abortion, the law has been reluctant to endorse any theory that life begins before birth or to accord legal rights to the unborn. * The right of privacy is broad enough to encompass a women\u2019s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy."
"\u2019 Domestic Violence awareness sites should be about preventing domestic violence in general. Organisations like your own, along with society should be aiming to protect and support all people in domestic violence situations, not just women and children. This is seen as a life injustice due to the discrimination that men experience because of their gender."
"I found Parre?as article worth reading because gender roles is an interesting topic. Parre?as examines the emotional strain transnational mother\u2019s experience and the emotional insecurity it causes their children. Parre?as acknowledges that the geographical distance between parent and family impacts emotional security, but the continuation of traditional gender roles makes the emotional strain even worse. Traditional gender ideologies make the responsibility of emotional care and security the responsibility of the mother even if the mother is a thousand miles away. Parre?as article is worth reading for anyone who wants to explore the impact of traditional ideologies has on families."
"My personal view toward O\u2019Connor\u2019s Everything That Rises Must Converge appears in this aspect from my life. In my home country most old people thinking as Julian\u2019s mother. I saw my grandmother doesn\u2019t agree with my aunt to invite her friend (whom from specific tribes) for celebration. When I read this story I remember how my grandmother thinks. I saw that action from my grandmother but the rest of my family doesn\u2019t believe in racism. I feel sorry about people who think like my grandmother."
"Often in the United States the death penalty is applied to black defendants and not white defendants. Cruz should not escape this punishment just because of his race. Race plays a huge role in the United States judicial system. With Nikolas Cruz being white, many excuses come up that would not work if an African American or Palestinian used them. Cruz has shown many red flags since he was a young age. During his first month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas, Cruz posted something on Instagram that he planned to shoot up the school. Deputies were informed, but did not act upon it. There is no doubt that if a minority posted something like Cruz, that they would be treated different. According to the \u201cDeath Penalty Information Center\u201d, \u201c Since 1976, there have been 293 black defendants executed for killing a white victim, while 31 white defendants have been executed for killing a black victim.\u201d (34) This shows that there is a divide in fairness within the judicial branch, due to racial problems. This statistic should open the eyes of readers. It is common for a black defendant to get the death penalty for killing one white victim, so why shouldn\u2019t Nikolas Cruz get the death penalty for killing seventeen victims and injuring seventeen more? Because he\u2019s white? Even though race should not play a role in defendants cases, it always will."
"One thing that I disagreed with in this book was the way Ham and Ware wrote about Darwin and his thoughts pertaining to race, it almost seemed like they were making Darwin out to be a sort of culprit of all racist ideas, like that without Darwin\u2019s books we wouldn\u2019t be racist or as racist. I am not saying that Darwin was not a big component of racism, but racism has been around since before Jesus\u2019 time Darwin was not born until eighteen-thousand years after Christ and did not publish his book The Descent of Man until near the end of his life. In Darwin\u2019s book, The Descent of Man, he \u201capplied evolutionary philosophy to mankind [and] popularized the idea of different races of people\u201d (Ham, 91). I agree with Ham and Ware that Darwin\u2019s ideas were detrimental in feeding ideas about how the white man is the superior race, but I don\u2019t believe Darwin is the one solely responsible for the state of our country and other countries. If you glance back on the foundations of our country with Christopher Columbus in 1492, he was racist and drove people who were not like him out of the land, and this was three hundred years before Darwin was born. I believe the true guilty party at hand is, of course, Satan. Since the Fall he has been trying to separate us from God and from each other into isolation. He is the one who feeds these ideas of racism into our brains and programs us to believe that a \u201csuperior race\u201d even exists. Yes, we are responsible for our own actions and choosing to believe these lies or not and acting on them or not, but if the world was not fallen then these thoughts would not even begin to creep into our minds."
"The power of one, or the idea of how one person can make a significant difference, is an important idea in relation to challenge in the novel. Giel Piet, one of Peekay\u2019s boxing coaches who had been sneaking tobacco to all of the prisoners, was forced to eat feces by Sergeant Ballman, a white racist who works at the prison. If Giel Piet had refused to eat the feces, the guards would have found the tobacco, resulting in the prisoners getting beaten along with Giel Piet . As Peekay witnessed this happen to his coach, he thought, \u201cIt made me angry. Angry it was done. Angry I couldn\u2019t do anything to stop it.\u201d"
"In the article \u201cNegative Effects of Children Forced into Extracurricular Activities\u201d by Baldwin Ellis it states that \u201cParents are generally the worst judges for their children\u2019s ability\u00b7Their emotional attachment clouds their judgment and believes that their child can do anything they set their mind too\u00b7\u201d as we all know that\u2019s not the case in the real world."
"Yet a part of her always stiffened with apprehension, expecting the person on the other end to realize that she was play-acting this professional, this negotiator of terms, to see that she was, in fact, an unemployed person who wore a rumpled nightshirt all day, to call her \u2018Freud!\u2019 and hang up (Adichie, 306)."
"(Shen, Wang & Shen, 2009). It is believed to reduce negative emotions. One study indicated Lai et al. (2008) indicated that students listening to slow music before the examinations tend to attempt the examination with less anxiety in comparison to the students who do not listen to any slow song. This study majorly focused on slow music as a key to reducing to anxiety. He conducted experiments with thirty-eight students and divided them into two different groups."
"The next arrangement is of Baarat, often known to be Rukhsti. At this day, the bridegroom along with his family, friends and relatives go to the bride\u2019s house or at the booking place(marriage hall) to pick her up to his house. It is the stage,very difficult for a female to leave her home and to go to a new home. In some families, the male comes to the bride\u2019s house after Nikaah and live here for the next of his life along with his wife. This event comprises Nikaah firstly and then a photo shoot and lunch or dinner(according to the time) and then the couple is given a new place to live in together. The couple becomes mehrams legally. At this event, the families of bride and of bridegroom come in front of each other and compete in dance and singing. In this way, it is appeared that the marriage is not only the union of two individuals but of two families indeed. Rukhsti is permitted only after Nikaah. When it comes a time to leave a house of one (bride) ,we come across tears from the family of bride.It is natural in fact and have no ostentations\u2019. It is difficult to leave a family in which one has spent her twenty to twenty-five years. Then a sacred book of Muslims is placed over the head of a bride by her brother and then she sits in wedding car or dooli type thing. And is picked to the new house. At new house,the couple is welcomed by the bridegrooms\u2019 family. And there is a flowery way to the stage at which the couple walks and reach the stage. After so many gossips, the couple is allowed to take rest. There happens a kind of \u201cmonh dikhae\u201d (face looking) between a couple. The husband is expected to give some gift to his wife after looking her face in isolation. Mostly people give some gold jewellery like ring or a necklace or a bracelet. As it is an era of technology now so some people prefer to gift a cellphone at monh dikhaae."
"It might be the most important word in the world. That says the way is open. That throws it right back on a the concept of timshel. While psychologically shattered Adam reminisces over Cathy, Lee and Samuel share philosophical discussions over the ancient Hebrew word \u201ctimshel. \u201d Timshel defies the pattern in the Cain and Abel tale, rather than condemning the less favored brother to a life of sin it pursues the issue of free will and grants Cal the strength to depart from the inherently bound evil motives that ossessed him at an early age."
"Continuing on the theme of children placed in residential care, it is now widely recognised that these children need to have special attention as \u2018\u2026many of these children may already have been disadvantaged socially, economically or emotionally\u2019 (Bebbington and Miles, 1989 in Davies et al 2001) The article expresses that the negative outcomes associated with family breakdown and subsequent severment of emotional attachments, can be positively negated by placing a child within an appropriate setting. There is now a written requirement for the local authority to take into account our multicultural society in the provision of day care and in recruiting foster parents."
"Taking into consideration all the above stated it is possible to conclude that in discussing the moral aspects of abortion we usually used many arguments in favor of one or another position. Whatever our personal view, it is important to be able to recognize the ways of argumentation in ethical reasoning, which in reality is not as logical as it might seem at first glance. It is necessary to remember that every human child should be wanted, nurtured, loved and cherished. In such a way birth control and abortion are the part of necessary policy in this direction. Choices in this case should belong to the pregnant woman, and only her wish to save or not to save a child should be the main argument in pro-choice position."
"They are still enjoying adult company enjoying helping adults or simply snuggling up to adults for company. Separation from their primary care givers is still a distressing time unless the toddler knows who they are going to be left with. This is often the age that care givers will try and start toileting training and some children will be able to be out of nappies within a few days. Children will start to tell adults or others how they are feelings rather than showing their feelings and temper mantras will start to decrease."
"If you are going to a friend\u2019s house, you should not go there empty-handed instead you should always bring some gifts. I am not telling you to bring expensive gifts like a diamond ring which is the size of a tennis ball, or a Plasma TV, although if you really insist then, that\u2019s your choice. But usually, small gifts such as a basket of fruits would be enough to show your respect because after all, it\u2019s the thought that counts. However, when bringing gifts, especially to a Chinese family, there are things you shouldn\u2019t bring. Such items are clocks or pears because the Chinese word for clocks sounds the same as the Chinese word for death whilst the Chinese word for pear sounds the same as the Chinese word for separation."
"\u201cGet my gun! \u201d yelled Curley to Carlson. Carlson left the barn to fetch the gun. \u201cWhat are you going to do? \u201d said George, full of fear. \u201cI\u2019m gonna\u2019 shoot that son of a bitch right in the back of his head! \u201d Carlson rushed back into the barn with a couple of guns in his hands."
"In the article \u201cLet Children Motivate Themselves\u201d By KJ Dell \u2018Antonia it says \u201cI should say that my children are joiners, not quitters, so I may come at this from a different angle. I spend more time saying no no gymnastics if you also play hockey, no musical instrument if you struggle every night with getting your homework done than I do trying to push my children into things. It\u2019s also easy to let your kids quit activities when you\u2019re neither emotionally nor financially invested \u201d"
"The problem is, they don\u2019t know whether their peers are promoting good or bad influence on them. In order to feel accepted in a social circle, they were more than willing to start smoking, stealing which will lead to a greater crime such as damaging public property and even doing drugs (Padma, 2014). Bad peer influence will instill additional stress or rather known as peer pressure in kids in which will make them become violent in the long run."
"Charles believed in divine rights that God had chosen him to be king so he and Archbishop Laud started to decorate the church which he said that if the church is decorated, you will be closer to God. He also married a catholic princess from France which was very unpopular. Oliver Cromwell and Parliament still wanted more power and no return to the Catholic religion. To make things worse for Charles the Catholics in Ireland killed 100,000 Protestants. Also another reason why parliament is to blame is because the king and parliament always used to argue about who controls the army and parliament made the king angry by taking over them without his permission."
"They make celebrations fun, and they help us to be who we are. Not just that friends also help us grow at a spiritual level. Each soul is on a journey .friends are guides who come into our lives play their roles and move on .don\u2019t we all have friends who we were very close to at one point, but with whom we are no longer in touch with now."
"Brittney and I have been through so many circumstances together; some good and some bad. Together we have grown as both people and friends. Even today we remain best friends. Through all of our laughs, silly jobs,\u00a0and bad times we\u2019ve never had a fall out or been upset with each other for anything we couldn\u2019t get over in five minutes. Although my mom has since moved from Savannah, Brittney and her mother still go visit her in her new home and my mom still visits them as well. I couldn\u2019t ask for a better friend to have to be there for me when I need it the most or to just call up when I\u2019m bored. Brittney and I will remain best friends for a long time and so will our families."
"Living in a diverse 21st century that is encountering rapid changes to gender equality and diversity and how we perceive every individual, recognising the importance of being able to adapt to changes happening around us in order for us to be able to survive and coexist. Society is defined by the participation of individuals and the roles they play. More often than not these roles are gender based. Therefor this essay will explore how gender roles affect male and female educational and professional choices, and the barriers they may encounter, identity change, implications and institutional responsibilities."
"I also feel so ashamed of myself, All the things that I have found out today make me realize just how similar I am to my father. I feel like a criminal. I am also a thiefjust like my fathert This feels very ironical considering how he taught me lessons on how to be righteous. I am saddened that I cannot have a chance to apologize to my friend and brother Hassan for what I did before I ran away from my problems. All I ever do is run, I am not even courageous enough to face my problems Baba is even better than I am because at least he did not abandon his illegitimate son even though he never had the courage to tell him the truth, I wish I could have gotten here sooner before the death of Hassan and Farzana because then I would have gotten a chance to apologize. I feel somehow responsible for the chain of events that took place in the life of Hassan, I really am the worst friend that anyone could ever have., How I feel ashamed that I kept a lot of secrets from Hassan. In fact, Baba and I are no different. Both of us are just liars. This makes me feel like a thief I also feel deep sorrow that Rahim who was a great influence in my childhood is now ill."
"Globalization of resources has also purposed migration. People tend to move to areas where there ideal resources are plentiful. For instance, the discovery of oil in Asian conventionally Islamic countries attracted massive flocking of Europeans and whites to these countries who settled around the oil rigs (Taylor, 2013). Sporadically scattered churches are a site to reckon in Saudi Arabia and Dubai. They are a living testimony to the Christianity influx in the region. Presence of Europeans and American families settled in Qatar is an indication of globalized culture and business."
"The author conducts a series of data analyses to prove that police become more violent and discriminatory after an event of substantial violence. After one of these events, like a riot for example, the pattern of police stops, searches, arrests, and their use of force were observed. One of the experiments was conducted using the data from 3.9 million timed and geocoded stops of pedestrians in New York City, and they were tracked before and after brutal events (Legewie 380)."
"Slim is not only respected for his skill as a ranch hand as they say \u2018he could kill fly on the wheelers butt with a bull whip without touching the mule\u2019 but he is seen as a man who thinks things through especially before speaking when it says \u2018his ear heard more\u2026 \u2018 Finally to show how highly he is respected the text says \u2018 his authority was so great that his word was taken on any subject, be it politics or love\u2019."
"We all know that India is not only known for technology industries but also because of it\u2019s variety of people, numerous languages, multiple customs and traditions; different races with different faces and marvelous landscapes. These always project India among other countries like \u201cunity in diversity\u201d. Most of us never know about northern states and North Indians like vise- versa but yet we join hands to support any sensational news created by media like Anna Hazare\u2019s corruption movement. We never know how many languages are exiting in our country."
"This background, combined with question about his racial self-identity, will soon lead him to have a violent behavior, including phases of drug use and crime. However, he will soon find value in his life, relying upon the principles of hard work and self improvement, plus additional skills in writing and jazz music. The novel starts with chapters introducing the mother of the author, Ruth McBride, and is already full of symbolisms and drama (McBride, n."
"Many suggest adoption as a practical alternative to abortion. But, in reality, this is not a decent substitute. The majority of middle class white couples that are willing to adopt do not want to adopt the mixed race babies (which are the majority put up for adoption). Why else would there be a waiting list for couples to be held in for a few years when there are so many other kinds of babies out there? Would those to claim to have a heart and save a life like these unwanted children grow up as wards of the state, living a life of distress and misfortune?"
"The study aimed to point out main and important reasons for the committed crimes; the first three main reasons were poor judgment, paying for drugs, being drunk or high, and economic pressure, desperation, and fear.\u00a0 In the same result of study, a separate finding recounted almost same reasons for these African American for committing crimes."
"I think as a child my parents civic action affected my civic engagement tremendously due to the fact that I couldn\u2019t drive and sometimes had no choice. I think for me as a child I was mainly dependent on my parents and what they were doing in the community to affect my involvement. As for most kids, I just followed what my parents did. As I have gotten older it is more up to me on what I get involved in and do with my spare time. I think for myself now, I am more civically active than if my parents didn\u2019t raise me in it. I do believe that they have affected my civic engagement for the most part."
"These powerful words prove that racial profiling needs to be used in order to form a more perfect union, it needs to be used to establish justice, it needs to be used to insure domestic tranquility, it needs to be used to provide for the common defense, and most definitely, it needs to be used to promote the general welfare. These reasons eliminate the questionability of the ethics behind racial profiling; proving that it is essential to the safety of others and it needs to be accepted as a reliable tool in law enforcement."
"Another thing to keep in mind is remembering NOT, and I repeat, NOT to wrap the gifts in black or white since those colours are the ones used in funerals. I hope I am not discouraging you from going to Chinese friend\u2019s house because of such rules; these are just little things that you should watch out for because the last thing you want is an angry mum chasing you down the street carrying a butcher knife, and shouting at you in Chinese, even if you cannot understand a word she is saying."
"Piri\u2019s identity and culture are influenced by his surroundings, and as well as the people he\u2019s around with. His childhood years were spent in the Spanish Harlem, that\u2019s where his violent perception is garnered from. His constant shift in location did affect his identity in many different instances such as racism and prejudice, the drug deals, the bloody fights all have shaped Piri\u2019s identity. Piri explains to us the environment he is surrounded by as \u201cI sure missed 111th Street, where everybody acted, walked, and talked like me. But on 114th Street everything went all right for a while.\u201d (24) This quote clarifies that Piri\u2019s identity is somewhat already shaped from street 111th. All the trouble and mischief Piri had learned from 111th Street has already swayed to an aggressive and a criminal identity. Piri\u2019s identity can fluctuate very differentially when he is on the streets contributing to unconstitutional actions and very differently when he is at home with his family."
"Hathorne asks Mary again if she was pretending that spirits choked her and tried to kill her and she still says it was pretence. This is evidently what Hathorne wanted as the stage directions he gleams with victory. His victory becomes apparent when he asks Mary to make herself faint if she is not being afflicted by any spirits as she claims to have done before."
"Professor Thomson\u2019s explanation is somewhat different; she too agrees that there is no justification for a woman to order the death of a foetus that lives following an abortion, but her reasoning is not dependent upon any acquisition or loss of rights. Thomson argues that a termination is just the right for a woman to detach the foetus from her body. This is not an act of murder (even though its death is inevitable during its infancy) but an entitlement to liberation, whatever its outcome.[21]"
"I would be best suited to work with women who suffer from anxiety and depression because of issues including: infertility, pregnancy loss, unplanned pregnancy, postpartum depression, cancer, and other women\u2019s health issues. I have life experience with the majority of these issues and I could relate well to women struggling with these troubles. I would be an engaged and empathic listener and would enjoy the opportunity to help other women help themselves. Although I have very little exposure to the following area, I am also interested crisis counseling and think that a career with the Phoenix Fire or Police Department would be interesting and rewarding. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics website provides the following list of duties that pertain to a Mental Health Counseling career: \u2022Diagnose and treat mental and emotional problems"
"This makes the quality of living for the Black family low. \u201cHe chucked me out the of the wheelhouse, that\u2019s how I got this\u201d as Team-man pointed to his lip. He had been hit after his father after he turned the boat around due to his father falling asleep. The fear of being hit or beaten by their dad is not healthy at all. It all slowly builds up between all the siblings and eventually they crack and Team-man tries to kill him."
"While I don\u2019t feel that statement is universally true, I do believe that being in child care helps kids to develop independence and confidence. Every day they separate from their moms and dads, and things turn out okay. It\u2019s wonderful to see children develop loving relationships with their caregivers, and learn different things from them than they would have learned from their parents."
"What matters most is that the child is learning how to observe his world, how to think, how to solve problems, how to navigate and function in his environment. The theorist whose theory is physical development is Arnold Gesell. His theory is that most physical skills cannot be taught but is programmed in our genetics, which means we will learn different physical skills when our body is ready to. In our setting, we support this by encouraging children but not forcing them to develop a physical skill. We provide a soft, cushioned area so that children can develop themselves physically without risk of hurting themselves."
"At my setting in Hillbourne, last summer Reception went on a school trip to Honeybrook Farm and there was a child, S. CD, in the class who had SEN. His mum had written a note to the class teacher to say that she wanted him to go on the mini bus with the other children and she would meet us at the farm. At the farm he stayed with his mum and his one-to-one up until lunch time. He had lunch with all the other children and after this he went home with his mum (as he only did mornings in Reception). After lunch we had a tractor ride so S and his mum went with the first group as they were going to go home \u2013 this was good because even\u00a0though he had SEN he was able to participate in most aspects of the school trip just as much as the other children."
"When Whit brings in the pulp magazine with the letter written by Bill Tenner, the men are all very impressed. They are not certain that Bill wrote the letter, but Whit is convinced he did, and tries to convince the others. In the transient life of these workers, it is rare to leave any kind of permanent mark on the world. In this letter Bill Tenner has achieved some of the immortality the other men cannot imagine for themselves. I think this upsets the workers a bit and makes them long for their dreams to come true even more"
"The acting in the play was excellent I believe personally. I was particularly impressed by various fields of their work. Hal (Actor): I think the actor highlighted the subtleties of playing his part. I really felt as if I was not seeing the actor himself but the character he is supposed to be playing and in this case Hal. This might also have been due to the fact that as a group we had not heard the actor speaking or known his personal character at all before the start. As a 14 year old boy he was very playful and mischievous and you could hear and see it in scenes he played."
"The word \u201cmeatballs\u201d makes us picture his hands and feet as round meatballs. This image in our minds helps us express our amusement. Furthermore, by reading both descriptions continuously we realise how they are both opposites and completely mismatched. Feng Ji-cai, the author, at this point in the story wants us to laugh and has designed these descriptions so well that we get the response he wants us to have. He makes us have a mental image of them in our mind, which makes it humorous. He then describes how the woman holds the umbrella when it is raining and not the man."
"I believe that by doing this job I found out and developed the skill to develop something that it can really be done and accomplish. I discovered this when I would collect with the rest of the members of the task and ideas simply began to come out of my mind and how I saw that all of us agreed to and knew that it can work. This learning matters due to the fact that my objective is to have a business of my own and by doing this job I was able to see a few of the highlights and things require to have an organization either profit or non-profit and this relate to my career due to the fact that as a manager I need to come up with methods, schedules, meetings, and so, on."
"\u2018Ancient and modern, clearly answers this question affirmatively. Indeed, the fact that convicted offenders almost universally seek and welcome the commutation of a death sentence to life imprisonment is consistent with intuitive ranking of the death penalty as the harshest of all punishments.\u2019 (Ehrlich, 1973)Only when their lives are threatened will some people understand the dignity and meaning of life. If the criminals behave well, the death penalty may change to life imprisonment or fixed-term imprisonment."
"A woman holds ownership of her own body; therefore she may abort her foetus if that is what she chooses \u201cit is in a very real sense her own\u2014to dispose of as she wishes.\u201d[5] Professor Thomson analogises: it is not that the woman and foetus are like two tenants occupying a small house that has been mistakenly rented to both of them\u2014the mother owns the house.[6] But not all claims of ownership hold an automatic right to dispose of their property. John Harris gives an example[7] suppose I own a life-saving drug, and have nothing planned for its use other than placing it on my shelf. If I meet a person who was dependent on that drug otherwise they will die, I would not be morally entitled to withhold the drug\u2014it would be wrong of me to exercise that right."
"Also, the fourteenth amendment, which provided citizenship for all persons despite their race or color and provided protection under the law for all, finally the most important one, is the thirteenth amendment, which ended the most inhumane mid-evil practices, which is slavery by prohibiting it and making a federal crime."
"It can save up to 20,000 lbs. of carbon dioxide per year using a more fuel efficient car. Buying fuel efficient cars not only reduce the amount of carbon dioxide release but also encourage companies to continue making and improving them owing to increased demand. So, let\u2019s take this simple way to reduce global warming effects. In conclusion, the several ways to reduce the effects of global warming are choose vegetarian meals, change your lamp with compact fluorescent bulb, and use public transportation or hybrid and fuel efficient car."
"The complex structure and language that use in school staff may have gaps between parents and school. Since parents consider the academic language that teachers use as challenged language and obstacles for them to getting touch with school staff. Another factor that may affect parental involvement is the teachers\u2019 effectiveness. Studies show that understandings of parental support are linked directly with teachers\u2019 efficacy. Relying on these studies there three categories of P.I activities, which are about teacher efficacy: conference, parents as volunteers, and parents as educators. Sometimes, parents are confused about their engagement in their children\u2018s education since they may not understand their children\u2018s learning needs. In addition, the complexity of the curriculum considers an obstacle incomprehension of children\u2019s education process."
"Labour has focused on work as a way of lifting families out of poverty, rather than raise benefits from the Welfare State. The Welfare State can be viewed as taking a benevolent role in family life but this is not always the case. Some critics argue that the relations between family and the state are an agent of social control. Sociologist Gosta Esping-Andersen refers to Britain\u2019s Welfare State system as a Liberal system. He argues that the state plays a limited role in family life; and the state only intervenes in family issues when there is a problem, which the family can not solve."
"My first adventure time traveling I decided to go to Ancient Rome in approximately the 15th century which was considered the Rome Renaissance. During the time I was there the Renaissance was significant because of all changes overall that occurred. The most significant changes that emerged as a result of the Renaissance I saw was in Europe architecture, art, literature, mathematics, music, philosophy, politics, religion and science. I noticed these fields flourished during the time frame of the Renaissance and led to many people questioning long held beliefs about each."
"The power of the woman comes from her spontaneity, presence and being who she is? She has been the tower of strength, patience and perseverance. History of nations worldwide is the proof of her significant role. She has been viewed as the nurturer, nurse and caregiver. Her image is the personification of love and tolerance. She creates, she gives and she embraces her family members unconditionally. She takes care of her home, her children and her family. She is there, always ready to serve and care."
"No equality exists in the workplace, education, income and health. Inequality is more pressing than poverty because it keeps individuals from having opportunities and to maximise their abilities to do something in society. Poverty is also pressing, but the individual has access to aids that can help them maximise their capabilities. In conclusion, this essay has defined poverty and inequality and also discussed the social consequences it can have. The measurement of poverty and inequality has been discussed and statistics have been used to argue the opening statement. This essay has proven, with reference to research and statistics, that inequality is a more pressing socio-economic issue than poverty in South Africa."
"Are we only what we learn from the agents of socialization or can we beat the odds stacked against us? The agents of socialization are some of the most influential situations that occur in our lives. They are our families our schools our peers and the mass media. Family is there to nurture the young child and provide for basic need and to teach values and beliefs. School comes along to enhance our world as we encounter those who are different then we are and where we start to learn that social attitudes and behaviors are vastly different by class and status."
"The Roman Catholic Church state that euthanasia is totally wrong and that life is sacred and only God can make a decision over death. Roman Catholics do accept that it is right to ease the suffering of those who are terminally ill, often knowing that the side affects of drugs may well speed up the death of a patient. This is known as the doctrine of double effect."
"A man may have more than one wife living with him. Once a woman gives birth and is nursing a child he is not supposed to bother her about sex. This makes the other wives happy as it gives them some attention. Parents and grandparents may live in the same camp as their offspring keeping the family close together."
"She knows that she could have been in the movies, which makes her even lonelier. Another lonely character is Crooks. He is segregated from the others because he is black. He also doesn\u2019t work near the others or stay in the bunkhouse. He tells Lennie about his need for company \u201ca guy gets too lonely an\u2019 he gets sick\u201d."
"On the other hand, the opposition argues that concealed carry on college campuses could deter mass shooting sprees. They argue that having guns on campus could deter students and teachers from going out on massive shootings on college campus. According to Students for Concealed Carry (SCC) they state, \u201cCampus shooters go on armed rampages because they misguidedly seek to make a point or attain infamy.\u201d (652). They further point out that having other concealed carry holders might deter a few campus shooters and it could potentially prevent them from going on massive shootings. Bringing concealed carry on college campus could deter shooters, but it could also put the lives of students and staff at risk as well. SGFS points out two shootings that have had armed police officer and still went on shootings even if the police officers were present (642). SCC explains that even if there were armed police officers present and still did not deter the shooters it still led to fewer deaths. This might be true however if concealed carry was allowed it would still not deter other shooters from going on massive shootings even if other licensed concealed carry holders were present. The SCC also states, \u201cThe question of whether or not concealed carry would deter would-be-mass-shooters should not be the determining factor in whether or not it is allowed on college campus.\u201d (653). This means that the SCC thinks that they should not just focus on the fact it could potential create mass shooters but to look at it as it could reduce the number of massive shootings. SCC goes on and explains, that if a person was allowed the same right to defend himself outside of the campus then why is a person allowed the same right while he is at campus (653). This shows that people inside of school should be offered the same amount of protection that they are getting while being on college campus. Although this makes a fair point guns being present on college campus would still not deter students and staff. The possibility of gun shootings would decrease if guns were not allowed on campus so why should we take the risk of allowing guns. Concealed carry on college campus would not deter students and staff instead it makes the chances of college shootings more likely if guns were in the presence of them."
"Mama\u2019s door. A man had news from Papa. Papa had finally made it to the desert. He was making the dream come true. Papa was building a church. Papa found the way to collect supplies for the construction and people to help somehow. After he came back home, he related to Urrea that he had made it and that he was still alive."
"In the first half of the line, Mrs Midas shows her acceptability of the fact that all human beings have inner desires and wishes, and that the word \u201cgranted\u201d here, acknowledges this fact. However the second half of the line seems to counter this and shows her condoning her husband for his selfishness, whilst at the same time questioning the sanity in having these inner desires and wishes being realized. Thus it can be assumed here that Mrs Midas is portrayed by Duffy as believing that all fantasies should remain as fantasies, as having them transcend into reality could have unwanted and unnatural effects."
"When you grow up in a culture you take your norms of behavior for granted. You don\u2019t have to think about your reactions, preferences, and feelings. When you step into a foreign culture, suddenly things seem different. You don\u2019t know what to do or say. Using Hofstede\u2019s Cultural Dimensions as a starting point, you can evaluate your approach, your decisions, and actions based on a general sense of how the society might think and react to you. Of course, no society is homogenous and there will be deviations from the norms Hofstede found, however, with this as your guide you won\u2019t be going in blind. The unknown will be a little less intimidating and you\u2019ll get a much-needed boost of confidence and security from studying this cultural model. Apply This to Your Life:"
"In addition to the above, the spectrum has also been created that building a wall will not only protect us from immigrants taking our jobs, but to stop other illegal activities such as fighting drugs and crime, in order to protect Americans who are killed and are damaged for illegal immigrants, because of terrorism on certain occasions and in the form of protecting the country\u2019s wealth. But at the same time there is no specific data that these people come to this country to steal Americans jobs, and a wall would not necessarily end these issues as there are other ways drugs can be transported from other places, terrorists and criminals will still find Ways to get into the country and a wall will not stop them. Clearly as stated in an article called Why Build a Wall? It states the following \u2018He does not want those refugees to take over American people jobs\u2019 (Jones). Referring to the same problem that is created when these people try to enter the country in a more legal way, being judged and without giving them an opportunity."
"At one point, in Of Mice and Men and Death of a Salesman they contrast as Willy wants to be successful and \u201cwell liked\u201d in order to gain status, whereas Lennie and George don\u2019t want status they want to own a piece of land and belong somewhere, I know this as George says \u2018it\u2019d be our own, an \u2018nobody could can us\u2019."
"In the 1950s and 1960s, there were very few widely accepted African American artists. Despite this, The Highwaymen, a loose association of 27 African American artists from Ft. Pierce, Florida, created idyllic, quickly realized images of the Florida landscape and peddled some 50,000 of them from the trunks of their cars. They sold their art directly to the public rather than through galleries and art agents, thus receiving the name \u201cThe Highwaymen\u201d. Rediscovered in the mid-1990s, today they are recognized as an important part of American folk history."
"However these sources are very useful, to start with the extract from the book is written from the point of view of an evacuee from a large city, who stays with someone in the countryside. The foster parents make an assumption that they are \u201ctoo poor to afford a pair of slippers\u201d. Although the real reason they don\u2019t have slippers, is because the amount of clothing they were able to carry."
"Beatrice\u2019s cousins named Marco and Rodolfo come to America from Italy to find work to feed Marco\u2019s family in Italy, as they are very poor. They plan to enter illegally. Eddie has feelings for his niece Catherine that he should not have. Meanwhile Catherine falls in love with Rodolfo and Eddie hates him because he is jealous as he loves her and he cannot stand any other man looking at her and touching her."
"The plot itself flips certain character identities using disguises, indistinct gender roles, and the allure of class mobility. Disguise is the most obvious plot twist leading to misconceptions in addition to a love triangle. This is initiated by Viola\u2019s idea to mask herself as a gentleman named Cesario. The situation focuses solely on the identity you portray to your environment which is not, in this case, the identity Viola has as her true self."
"The actor here brought out the comedy which should have come from Dee very well. She did this throughout the play with the sound of her voice and her actions as a child. She did this a lot when with the other two characters through annoyance and curiosity. The character I feel physically inhabited their character in the best way possible compared to their other two actors. She did not just act one part of her character very well and enjoyably but both parts as an adult and a child. I think the design of the set worked very well. It was set in a round. This made it more powerful."
"Now I would like to tell you the examples of the importance of good manners. First, Thank you letters are important. Whether someone has sent a gift or entertained you at their home, it is important to acknowledge their effort and thoughtfulness. They have done something special for you and a handwritten note or letter shows that you are prepared to respond and take the time to value what they have done and thank them for it."
"\u201c And this. Even this, \u201d ( p.18 ) . The novelette starts. In less important custodies, this may non be a hopeful starting motor, but Abani tips us out of the fog fleetly. \u201c This memory like all the others was a prevarication. \u201d ( p.18 ) . Abigail, a vernal miss in Nigeria, is nostalgically remembering her female parent \u2018s memorial service. Abigail act of bereavement is to some extent disturbing. It is symbolised by among other Acts of the Apostless, the violent death of birds and subsequently dressing them in lacing from her female parent \u2018s espousal frock."
"The term police brutality\u201d has been in our society for the last 150 years. Law enforcement officials, police officers to be exact would use extreme forces against those who would go on strike, those they were arrested, etc. The time when this term started to be used was in the 1870s. This was the time where segregation was happening."
"While pageants are said to present a sense of self-esteem and value for the participants, these competitions often cause damaging emotional issues for an already trying adolescent life. One young participant anonymously said, \u201cI used to think I was pretty, but once I got on stage and didn\u2019t hear my name called the world came to an end and from then on, I\u2019ve called myself ugly everyday\u201d (Anonymous, 2010)."
"Lastly, by letting people from foreign countries immigrate to United States, it allows us to become a more diverse nation. Even though United States has goals for immigrations, there are still many rules and regulations involved; not anyone can just enter United States and become permanent or temporary residents. United States may deny visas or admission on either the temporary admission or permanent admission for many reasons. Some reasons may be because of criminal records, health records, or terrorism concerns. Immediate family members of a United States citizens are allow immigrating to the United States without many limitations. Citizens of the United States are allowed to sponsor relatives for permanent residents under the family-sponsored preference program."
"Shakespeare uses King Lear\u2019s madness to show absurdity and how life can lose meaning. In multiple conversations between Lear and other characters, Shakespeare shows Lear\u2019s inability to properly conduct a conversation without absurdity. A section of the conversation between Lear and Edgar reads, \u201cLook, look a mouse: peace, peace, this piece of toasted cheese will do\u2019t\u201d (4.6.88-9). As in Waiting for Godot where many of the conversations while they wait are absurd, as Lear descends into madness the words constructed for him by Shakespeare are also absurd. After the death of his daughters, specifically Cordelia, King Lear finally reaches the conclusion that life is meaningless and that he has nothing left for himself. Shakespeare writes the following lines for King Lear, \u201cWhy should a dog, a horse, a rat have life and thou no breathe at all?\u201d (5.3.304). Lear proposes the question as to why certain things even have life if one specific person cannot live. Lear dies thereafter, showing that he has escaped this life that has become meaningless. Unlike King Lear, the characters in Waiting for Godot never reach a traumatic moment that allows them to shed light on life\u2019s meaninglessness, but instead remain stuck in their constant cycle."
"Naturalism was rampant during the 1930\u2019s. The characters tended to be poor and hopeless. The authors themselves tended to be pessimists. The genre merely reflected the thoughts and circumstances of society. Black Tuesday crushed the nation and the once fertile fields of the Midwest were not yielding enough crops to feed the hungry and poor nation. With its bundle of lonely bindle stiffs and unattainable dreams, Of Mice and Men fits perfectly into this desolate and dreary genre and yet did not belong at all."
"In a study prepared by the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG), it pointed out that the result ofthe review of cases done by the Supreme Court \u201cpoint all too clearly to the imperfections,weaknesses and problems of the Philippine justice system\u201d. Some decisions of the trial courts wereoverturned for imposing death penalty on offenses which were not subject to death penalty. Otherdecisions of the lower courts were set aside because of substantive and procedural errors duringarraignment and trial. Still others were struck down because the lower court mis-appreciatedevidences.In a survey conducted among 425 convicts in 1998, 105 or 24.7% were agricultural workers, 103were construction workers, 73 were transport workers, and 42 were in workers in sales andservices. Only 6% finished college while 32.4 % finished various levels of high school while theremaining did not go to school or have finished only elementary or vocational education It is perhaps important to point out that out of these 46 crimes punishable by death, the deathpenalty has been applied to only 17 crimes."
"Shakespeare\u2019s The Winter\u2019s Tale is a story of both tragic and comedic events. The structure of Shakespeare\u2019s play, The Winter\u2019s Tale, creates a mixed genre of both tragedy and comedy. The first half of the play is considered a tragedy, and the second half shifts to a comedy. Shakespeare uses this structure to convey the concept that one must first face struggles in order to experience true happiness. All the characters are facing some type of hardship during the first acts of the play, and then a sudden change is made where the characters start enjoying pleasure and happiness."
"There is a definite segregation in society. Blacks and whites lived in largely polarised communities with clear demarcations between them. Cassie is a fighter, like her mother in many ways but more nai?? ve. She manages to get justice with Lillian Jean, this is a crucial point in the book where the situation has reversed and finally there is evidence of some form of even-handedness. Cassie has inflicted some form of control on a white girl and her contentment is evident when she says: \u201cshe apologized. For herself and for her father. For her brothers and her mother."
"Each person is different, so even when there is a group of like people there are going to be difference within the group. a.i. Example- In a small diversity class of students there are 20 or so students that are all working towards passing the class taught by Madison. All thought the group of people all are working towards the same goal; they are all very different in their approach to passing the class. They are all students, but they are graduating at different times, they have different working styles, communication styles and are different ages."
"In the broader context of the society, Snipes was fearful of what was going around him as their were threats of nuclear aggression on his country. He could pray silently alone for him not to die, something that affected his later spirituality. As such, there are positive ways in which the exosystem influenced him. He believed it was his duty to go to school, learn and become a worthwhile citizen, something that he actually achieved. In other words, he was integrated into the macrosystem, the outermost layer of a child\u2019s development."
"George is an important character in \u2018Of Mice & Men\u2019 suffering from the American depression. For George there is no escape from him being a migrant worker because of the American Depression. Steinbeck introduces George as a relatively small person compared to his huge companion Lennie; however George\u2019s mental abilities are much higher. George is a caring man with a big heart but has developed a hard edge due to the tough times he has to face as a migrant worker which he cannot escape from."
"Therefore, by comparing the commonality of mothers in different situations we could say essentialism and constructionism sometimes are not to be separated. The issue of external influence becomes very closely related to the examination of mothers in the novel to be discussed, as the mothers and caregivers are affected by particular events and the after effects factors, which is slavery in Beloved. Mothering under these conditions does become constructed and defined by the circumstances at hand."
"It helps to see a sample of work done in similar formats, especially when you are writing this type of essay for the first time. We do have compare and contrast essays examples priced right to suit you at any stage of your education. These essays compare and contrast examples are written by a team of experts in various fields, and so you know there is no limit to the help we can offer."
"Hence, Little Bee\u2019s claim as being merely a witness of mass murder and rape would not have qualified in the least for asylum much like a situation that reached the VANGUARD newspaper in the UK. \u201cMay Brown, a seventeen-year-old college student, fled to Britain from her home country three years ago after witnessing her father\u2019s murder and being subjected to sexual abuse \u2026 However, despite her marriage her application was rejected\u201d (\u201cAll Africa\u201d). Many immigrants who landed in the UK around these years were either deported swiftly or detained in mass numbers, overpopulating detention centres."
"The Development Relief and Education for Minors Act will put them on a scheduled plan towards citizenship. Society views of immigration reform and citizenship decreasing in the standards for those deemed worthy of citizenship. The impact of the movement for young people seeking passage of the law has consequences. If parents do not file appropriately and accordingly to their arrival, then they or children can be subject to future consequences."
"If we solely rely on native-born workers, our labor force will shrink drastically. Studies have shown that immigrants pay taxes and in actuality, immigrant families help grow our gross domestic product. The GDP is the total value of goods produced and services provided that make the economy grow. Professor of Economics and Social Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, George J. Borjas, an immigration skeptic, ends through various studies that low-skilled immigration can harm low-skilled natives but have a positive impact on both medium and high-skilled natives."
"Serveg (2006) looked at the benefits and barriers in parental involvement and the team highlighted the importance of parent/therapist rapport which would enable a deeper understanding for all regarding the child\u2019s anxiety. Parental involvement would offer the therapist feedback regarding the home, school and social environment of the child and also offer a gauge in the progression of treatment (Surveg 2006). The therapist is then able to tailor the treatment to address the specific needs of the child (Surveg 2006). Another advantage to parental participation is the interpretation of the child\u2019s choice of language when talking about their anxieties or recalling a feeling (Surveg 2006)."
"According to UN Special Rapporteur on Torture (United Nations 2000) various methods of torture are used in police custody. Among them, public flogging, public lashing being forced to swallow detergent; sodomy; burning with blow torch; electric shocks; suspension by the wrists; forcible extraction of teeth; beating during public demonstrations; extended detention in solitary confinement; stabbing ; death in custody as a result of ill-treatment; torture during pre-trial detention for the purposes of obtaining confessions; overcrowding in pre-trial detention centers, malnutrition, contagious diseases; asphyxiation; beatings on the soles of the feet; insertion of metal nails under 12 toenails; verbal abuse including sexual insults; shutting the fingers in a door;"
"Conversing with clients via chat forums or groups, one on one video chats, or through private websites can help the counselor in treatments or therapeutic mediating. Although some clients will prefer the office sessions, the idea of right now therapy can help in crisis situations and will allow the counselor and the patient almost immediate contact via advanced technology. Technology offers convenience and benefits for both the practitioner and participant. With the rapid changes in\u00a0society, technology will continue to be a vehicle to enhance the performance and innovations of the counseling profession (Skovalt, Grier, and Hanson, (2001)."
"When I got the form to pick my eighth grade elective class, I went to her office to learn more about what kind of elective I needed to satisfy. She ended up asking me about my story and my goals in life. And then, she started talking passionately about her college experience. Near the end of our conference, she invited me to check with her periodically and visit her for any questions, even if they were not school related. In addition to making me feel welcomed, she made sure to introduce me to Marina, another Egyptian student, who ended up becoming my best friend. Marina was thrilled to finally have another Egyptian girl with her in the school and so was I. She told me about the days where she would have spent lunch crying alone, and I was glad I was there for her and that I did not have to go through that myself. Ms. Kaye frequently checked on the both of us and always expressed how much she believed that we would both \u201cachieve great things.\u201d Her encouragement combined with Marina\u2019s friendship at this transitional phase made me adapt to school faster, inspired me to keep working thirty times harder than others and helped me vividly envision myself attending UCLA one day."
"If I catch any one man, and he\u2019s alone, I get along fine with him. But just let two of the guys get together an\u2019 you won\u2019t talk. Jus\u2019 nothing but mad. You\u2019re all scared of each other, that\u2019s what. Ever\u2019 one of you\u2019s scared the rest is goin\u2019 to get something on you\u201d (85). Crooks wants his part of the American Dream where all men will be equal and he thinks that he gets close to this the night Lennie and Candy end up in his room and share the dream of the farm with him. It does not take long for him to have to face the reality that there is no equality in the world."
"The poem \u2018Then and Now\u2019 by Ooderoo of the tirbe Noonuccal provides a native viewpoint of the Australian identity by highlighting the extreme modification in way of life because the early colonisation and English settlement. The contrast of the Aboriginal culture and their connectedness to the land is compared against the \u201ctraffic and trade of the hectic town\u201d. The poem adds a contemporary Native response and outlook towards the emposed brand-new culture and society procedure."
"Police say criminals often contact victims in a variety of ways, including over the phone, e-mail, text or social media. EPS say in many cases, the fraudsters often speak the same language as their victims and their calls may appear to come from legitimate police or government phone numbers. But, the identity theft is targeted to the high profile people and financial stable personnel."
"The city of my dreams is neither too big nor too small. (Jenna) It is clean, there aren\u2019t any cigarette butts, chewing gums, papers or dog dirt on the floor.( Ang\u00e9lique /Marjorie) It is Green, ecological (St\u00e9phanie): there are less traffic and pollution because people use alternative means of transport (Gamz\u00e9/ Maria) and the cars run with solar energy. The houses are equipped with solar panels too to protect the Earth (Fanny/Stephanie) People recycle their wastes (Gamze ) The environment is respected (Jenna) &the scenery is pleasant because the huge sky scrappers & tower blocks have been replaced by detached houses. (Marjorie/Sabrina) The city is built with recycled materials to fight global warming (Fanny) In this ideal town People are happy & safe, they can have walks in the streets & gardens even at night."
"It appears that she wasn\u2019t told or informed earlier and the word \u2018find\u2019 tells us that she wasn\u2019t expectant of this and just woke up one day to discover that she lost her job for no apparent reason. This sudden incident of misfortune must have left her troubled and distressed about how to make ends meet. Secondly, the use of tripling in \u201cno query, nowarning, no probe-. \u201c, stresses that it lacked the slightest bit of justice and largely emphasises the unfairness of the incident as she was given no warning, no explanation, no investigation was carried out and no queries were arised about this."
"In this essay, I will explain why I harbour such beliefs. Firstly, climate models have been proven untrustworthy. There are flaws in the climate model calculations used to predict the effects of Global warming. In these computer models, the assumption is made that the main climate driver is Carbon Dioxide and that the Sun\u2019s effect on the climate is minimal."
"A lot has already been died inside the tunnel due to dynamite smoke, falling rocks, and avalanche. Many children also died because of mercury poisoning from the fish that they eat because in making gold the ore that the miners collect are mixed with water and mercury and the mercury deposits are disposed nto their lands leading to the sickness of their people and themselves. We also saw in the film, a girl named Angeli Cabrera, a 10 year old girl who lives at Manapla, Negros Occidental."
"Unfortunately, they are not all being followed or properly enforced. We should start there. One change I would make is to standardize gun registration across the nation. This is\u00a0currently a state issue and each state has different standards and procedures. Doing this would have many benefits. First, it will make it much easier to follow and implement the laws already in place. By standardizing the procedure, you can then more easily create a national database with this information, which can be accessed by each state. I believe this process would help to prevent smuggling between states. In order to gain the support of the pro gun group, this process cannot overshadow state laws on gun ownership. Another possible solution I would make involves the design and manufacture of firearms. Gun manufactures have done very little to make their products safer. I believe we can pressure gun manufactures, as we have done with other manufacturers of consumer products, to make their products safer and less likely to discharge accidentally."
"The consequences of the study brought about the establishment of boards and legislations to govern research and stipulate its rules for all the research to be carried out. The study also raised issue about the professional ethics since they used human to experiment on their research and used deception to gain their trust and it showed more of racism than medical issues."
"Amman is not only the capital of Jordan, but it is also the most popular and largest city in the country. Amman is the center of the countries political and economic culture. Jordan shares its borders with Saudi Arabia and Israel, making the country very diverse between cultures and religions (Schmidt, 2006). Amman, Jordan is the largest city in Jordan and reflects many western cities. For example, with commercial building and modern hotels. The people of Jordan are often called Jordanians and speak Arabic."
"This article discusses six cases of child serial killers, their behavioral characteristics, methods of killing and the crimes of themselves. This article supports the usefulness of criminal profiling in determining offender identity. This article will further support the aspect of evaluations in criminal profiling as well. Quayle, J.

"Always be polite and sincere. * Entertain them. They deserve it after working very hard in their lifetime. Try to avoid letting them watch television. * Show an interest in their life. Ask them about their childhood, or how things were in the past. They\u2019ll be happy that you\u2019re interested, and glad to tell you all sorts of cool stories. * Be a friend. Offer to read to them, or maybe even have a cup of hot chocolate together. The person will love your company, and you\u2019ll both find a pal. * Be patient. With age, people sometimes lose their logic and reasoning."
"Based on their findings, the newly-rich lottery winners were shown to have similar levels of happiness before and after winning. This indicated that there wasn\u2019t a consistent relationship between increased happiness and personal financial gains, and that the baseline level of happiness for the lottery winners over time would remain nearly the same."
"Racism is the major theme of the play where Harry\u2019s parent shows discrimination against blacks. Her mother discriminated her servants, Sam and Willie telling Harry not to spend most time with them. His father has been found most of the time drinking in whites place. Although, Harry, Willie, and Sam were in good relationship, his racism that has been instilled by his parents is evident and mostly torn them apart. Harry being raised by a racist family and in environment full of racism, he developed racial discrimination character that was evidenced when interacting with his fiends Sam and Willie."
"The debate about abortion focuses on two issues; 1.) Whether the human fetus has the right to life, and, if so, 2.) Whether the rights of the mother override the rights of the fetus. The two ethicists who present strong arguments for their position, and who I am further going to discuss are that of Don Marquis and Judith Thomson. Marquis\u2019 \u201cFuture Like Ours\u201d (FLO) theory represents his main argument, whereas, Thomson uses analogies to influence the reader of her point of view."
"This means too things, We need to stop assuming the worst of every black person that looks suspicious, and we also need to not assume that every police officer is racismr Although it so hard to do, especially in times like these, we have to remember all the good encounters happening that we don\u2019t hear about, This alone is reason enough to generalize less and focus more on the isolated incidents. In light of my former statement I choose not to say \u201cPolice assuming that All blacks are violent\u201d Because this cannot be not true, However in light of the shootings that have happened, there seems to be a pattern of innocence in the black victims."
"This portrays his personal not belonging The structure that differentiates the two is the formation as a fairy tale like story. By using a very popular kids structure Luhrmann shapes the perception of not belonging using personal, cultural and social context. Scott Hastings as the hero is supported by his whole family and many other dancers that share his coach, Lez Kendall\u2019s dance studio. This puts pressure on Scott to dance traditionally; by the rules of Barry Fife, or also known as the enemy, and not his unique style."
"As Americans they besides felt they had guaranteed rights to freedom of faith and cultural diverseness, which allowed them to show their ethnicities and to pattern them by fall ining ethnically based associations. By appreciating and encompassing these rights, they are heedfully taking portion in one of the basiss of American civilization and political orientation, which are the above mentioned civil autonomies of personal freedoms. Many topics in her survey did acknowledge that they recognised there were bounds to the look of ethnicity, as portion of the model of civil autonomies is that one can show and pattern personal freedoms merely to the extent that they do n\u2019t enforce on others \u2018 personal freedoms. Some felt, that the freedom allowed to cultural groups was smaller than that given to the mainstream civilization, but however, they to the full appreciated these civil autonomies, and felt basically, that they had the \u2018American right to be Indian \u2018 ( Dhingra 2008 ) ."
"It begins by saying, \u2018this is just to let you know everything is alright now,\u2019 which tells us the author of this letter has resolved their problem. It then says that, \u2018the man you sent found our house and we went down to the bank with him. The bank agreed to let our loan go on for a while longer. \u2018 Here the author is saying that one of the New Deal\u2019s alphabet agency\u2019s employees helped the author keep their house by extending the loan of one of the banks that had been one of the few kept by Roosevelt as it was supposedly a good bank. The author writes, \u2018you remember I wrote to you about losing the furniture."
"All for the good of their country. \u201cBetter never means better for everyone, \u2026 It always means worse, for some.\u201d(p. 198) People did not want to acknowledge how society was falling to pieces around them. \u201cWe lived, as usual, by ignoring. Ignoring isnt the same as ignorance, you have to work at it.\u201d(p. 53) The Sons created a world where it would be safe for children, and women. It also eliminated sex. It was no longer for enjoyment, but a necessity for life. Before it had been out of control, \u201cThere were stories in the newspapers\u2026 but they were about other women, and the men who did such things were other men. None of them were the men we knew. The newspaper stories were like dreams to us, bad dreams dreamt by others.\u201d(p. 53) People had the freedom to do whatever they wanted, and many took advantage of this, \u201cWe seemed to be able to choose, then. We were a society dying\u2026 of too much choice.\u201d(p. 24) The Sons took away their freedom of choice and gave them something else, \u201cThere is more than one kind of freedom\u2026 Freedom to and freedom from. In the days of anarchy, it was freedom to. Now you are being given freedom from. Dont underrate it.\u201d(p. 24) The Sons of Jacob were able to obtain control over society, because society was ready for a change. People were sick of living in fear and afraid for their future. The Sons changed this by dominating the women by giving them strict rules to follow and reducing their role in life to that of giving life. However, they also attempt to suppress the need to touch, which will be their undoing. Works Cited Atwood, Margaret. The Handmaids Tale. Toronto: McClelland-Bantam, Inc., 1985."
"1.2Explain the importance of promoting the rights of all children and young people to participation and equality of access. It is essential that all children have full access to all areas of education to allow them to fully develop in every way possible. There is much legislation in practice to aid this including every child matters, the SEN code of practice and the disability discrimination act. Schools are required to allow every child to follow an individual learning plan catered specifically to their personal needs. In addition to this all children have the right to an equal education in a mainstream school with the opportunities to play and learn together."
"Another character whose personality has been affected by his dreams was Crooks. However, unlike the others, Crooks\u2019 personality is greatly affected. Crooks\u2019 dream has a different effect on him. It brings him misery, because he once had everything and now he lost it all. Although, he has accepted that fact that his dream is unattainable, he may still have a little bit of hope. However he has accepted his fate better than the rest of the characters who seem to be unable to accept the reality that their dreams would most likely not come true. As a result, he is bitter and he has isolated himself from everyone. It has drastically affected his personality and his attitude towards life."
"A major constraint for artists in Asia, especially in the past, is that social roles greatly impede and discourage people of lower status from creating meaningful or unique art, as they are looked down upon. This is reflected in the homogeneity of art work in Asian cultures, where conformity is favored. Albeit, artists of lower status in the United States, namely minorities, have also faced a lot of adversity when trying to create art and getting recognized for it. In fact, I have learned of numerous minority artists that recognize their constraints and have not only become activists for equality, but also role models for other members of their community."
"It aims to bring the realization closer to home through a nationwide investigation of the manifestations of climate change. The documentary brings together some scientists from local and international institutions like; Dr. Leoncio Amadore, Rafael Serga, Dr. Rosa Perez etc. and other climate change experts. Signos delivers Filipino viewers an extensive look on climate change; its causes, effects and how to prevent its disastrous outcomes. How this documentary did configure my knowledge about global warming? This documentary makes me realize that we should take global warming seriously."
"The idea was that we would act out the life of a man and his turbulent childhood in alternating scenes, to show how aspects from his childhood made him what he is today. We stopped pursuing this idea when we realised the difficulty involved in visually trying to make the audience see regression in the character while still maintaining an air of seriousness to the play. Our (then) final idea in the final concept of our play was to explore the way that people can relate to literature."
"Furthermore, racial inequality is also brought up in the first chapter of the book. One example is on page 4, when Scout mentions, \u201cSo Simon, having forgotten his teacher\u2019s dictum on the possession of human chattels, bought three slaves and with their aid established a homestead on the banks of the Alabama River some forty miles above Saint Stephens.\u201d In this quote, Lee is introducing the idea of racism by bringing up the practice of slavery. African Americans were bought and owned like property, which signifies that they had little value in society. The practice of slavery foreshadows the prejudice and bias against African Americans which plays a major role later in the novel. Another example of racial inequality being shown early in the novel is, \u201cThe sheriff hadn\u2019t the heart to put him in jail alongside Negroes, so Boo was locked in the courthouse basement,\u201d (page 14). This quote shows that African Americans and white people were kept in different jailhouses because even white criminals were more valuable than blacks. Lee implies that putting a white man in the same jail as an African American man is almost like torture to the white man. The officer would feel bad if he put Boo in jail with a black man, which shows the cruel treatment African Americans had to deal with. Discrimination, based on race and ethnicity, is still experienced by many people today. Racism plays a crucial role in the second part of the story during the Tom Robinson trial. Atticus states, \u201cIn our courts, when it\u2019s a white man\u2019s word against a black man\u2019s, the white man always wins. They\u2019re ugly, but those are the facts of life,\u201d (page 295). Atticus is explaining in any situation, a white man is always considered more trustworthy than a black man. This conveys the message that African Americans were treated unfairly, which eventually leads to Tom Robinson being convicted and his death. Still, even in the modern day, racism is a common practice in most parts of the world."
"Eric, a man who stand over 6 feet tall was selling untaxed cigarettes in a corner of Staten Island, NY where he lost his life after pleading with the officers to let him breathe. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d were the words he repeated to the officers while on a choke hold before losing his life. (Baker, Goodman, Mueller) Gardner was a fallen victim of police brutality. It could have been easily prevented by handling the situation in a different matter. Perhaps if he weren\u2019t a big man of color, he wouldn\u2019t have been a threat."
"The bar chart compares the cost of an average house in five major cities over a period of 13 years from 1989. We can see that house prices fell overall between 1990 and 1995, but most of the cities saw rising prices between 1996 and 2002. London experienced by far the greatest changes in house prices over the 13-year period. Over the 5 years after 1989, the cost of average homes in Tokyo and London dropped by around 7%, while New York house prices went down by 5%. By contrast, prices rose by approximately 2% in both Madrid and Frankfurt. Between 1996 and 2002, London house prices jumped to around 12% above the 1989 average. Homebuyers in New York also had to pay significantly more, with prices rising to 5% above the 1989 average, but homes in Tokyo remained cheaper than they were in 1989. The cost of an average home in Madrid rose by a further 2%, while prices in Frankfurt remained stable. (165)"

"Due to my profession, I learned to practice the professional ethics or exhibit the behaviors which are expected from a person of my status. In addition to this, it seems as if society often keeps an eye to the things which I did. My performance and my achievements (as well as some failures) were often noted by other people (especially our nosy neighbors) which made me learn or understand that I have to perform better and show a better performance. It also made me perform actions which conforms to the norms of the society and see to it that I do not violate any law which the society has set in my path."
"As a consumer think of a place you like to shop at because of the so-called great bargains, coupons, cash back and or discounts they offer. Commonly known as GameStop, Game Stop Corp is an American company that deals in video games, tablets, phones etc. With over 7, 117 retailer shops spread out throughout the US, Game Stop has established its headquarters in Grapevine, Texas. Research conducted on companies like Game Stop and JC Penney proves that customers enjoy and love it when their suppliers give them frequent discounts on their purchases."
"In addition to their school\u2019s lack of preparation, many of them tend to come from low-income families that do not have any college graduates. They start at a disadvantage and fall further behind the second they start attending an ill-prepared school. Advocating for a fair system of education is ideal, but not practical. However, calling for an adequate system is very realistic. Not every school has to have an enormous campus, a new football field, numerous well-funded sports teams or even fancy technological learning tools."
"Einstein states that \u201cthe energy of a light ray spreading out from a point source is not continuously distributed over an increasing space but consists of a finite number of energy quanta\u201d (Einstein 1905) [1]) this went against the accepted Maxwellian theories of light and radiation, due to this many scientists did not accept this theory, one of these scientists included Niels Bohr, who stated in his Nobel address in 1922 (17 years after Einstein first proposed the idea, and 1 year after he received the Nobel prize for his work on photoelectricity) that the idea was \u201cquite irreconcilable with so-called interference phenomena [and] not able to throw light on the nature of radiation\u201d (Helge Kragh 2012 [2])."
"The successful use of women\u2019s clubs as a means of involving women in community-wide family planning activities impressed the state government to the degree that it set about organizing such clubs in every village in the state. The project also serves as a pilot to test ideas that the government wants to incorporate into its programs. Government medical staff members have been sent to Jamkhed for training, and the government has proposed that the project assume the task of selecting and training government health workers for an area of 2. million people. Another important family planning program is the Project for Community Action in Family Planning. Located in Karnataka, the project operates in 154 project villages and 255 control villages. All project villages are of sufficient size to have a health subcenter, although this advantage is offset by the fact that those villages are the most distant from the area\u2019s primary health centers. As at Jamkhed, the project is much assisted by local voluntary groups, such as the women\u2019s clubs."
"Abuse is described but the novel\u2019s recurrent and most stirring images of a cave. These include when Plato illuminates the cave which Maria had suppressed from the thoughts of childhood memories. Maria\u2019s family was located in Greece. However, a cave in a beach in Nigeria gave her an enduring scar in her emotions and her physical (Emmerich, 25-35). To fight this feeling, she avoided sharing with any person and kept it to herself. When Anna comes into Maria\u2019s life, she indirectly and directly rustles this part of Maria\u2019s life. Maria is no longer hiding in her emotional cave anymore."
"I have encountered a number of secretaries or persons in authority who would converse with me on formal matters and would speak to and address me as if I was just their high school friend, their little sister, and the worst of all, was one of their maids. As persons in authority who are engaged to talking to people every day, they should be mindful enough of how they would treat their clients. No matter how high one\u2019s position is, I would never respect him if he acts like an uneducated person who is rude, arrogant, and impolite. And if in case he gets hurt by my usual disrespectful acts\u2014being frank and straight-forward of my thoughts\u2014I would never apologize, because he needs to know that what he was doing with his clients is wrong, and someone has to point it out to him, no matter how harsh it may sound."
"For example, a person who commits a killing in a fit of rage or a person who is motivated to kill by receiving insults or physical abuse, are likely to be charged with second-degree\u00a0murder. But the act of killing must happen instantly after the fit of rage or insults because if time lapses between the two than it permits the chance for thought to occur which would turn into premeditation and therefore become first-degree murder. Defenses against second-degree murder include actual innocence, insanity, and self-defense. Third-degree murder or manslaughter is different from the other degrees because it refers to homicides that result from someone\u2019s action that is unlawful or negligent. Other names for third-degree murder include negligent homicide, negligent manslaughter, or involuntary manslaughter. Manslaughter is a less serious crime than first or second degree murder because it involves carelessness and not purposeful killing. An example of manslaughter is a drunk driver who causes a fatal accident can be charged with vehicular manslaughter. Defenses against manslaughter include actual innocence, accidental killing and intoxication."
"In Ewa D\u0105browska\u2019s article \u2013 \u201cWhat is Universal Grammar, and has anyone seen it?\u201d she addresses each of the arguments in support of Chomsky\u2019s theory. The article argues that to date, there is in fact no agreement on what UG actually is, and critically assesses ten of the most compelling arguments in favour of UG."
"1.3.5.The Identity Crisis The theme of identity today is one of the most challenging cultural nodes for education in general and the pastoral. The term itself is rich and complex in nature in the sense that it can be defined by various filed of studies. However, in a simple definition, identity is the fact of being who or what a person or thing is. Moreover, identity could be understood in the interdisciplinary context. In fact the answer to questions who I am, who I must become cannot be given without a reference to a multiplicity of personal data, social and cultural that enter simultaneously in play."
"One in six job-seekers credit social media for helping find their current job. 52% of job-seekers use Facebook for the job search, 38% use LinkedIn, and 34% use Twitter\u201d. Social Media also allows companies to reach out to and interact with their customers. Companies use social media to get immediate customer feedback on certain items or things dealing with the company, so if it is disliked, they can make quick changes to ensure that their customers will be satisfied (ProCons, 2014). Companies also include a tab on their social media content that is just for their customers, allowing customers to interact with the company and give feed as well (Chaturvedi, 2014). That last thing that it helps companies out with, is being able to advertise their products in a fast, easy and efficient way. According to Chaturvedi (2014), sale leads generate from social media, because of the capability that companies have to advertise through social media."
"It just seemed right and I found on this particular test that I was really getting the answers wrong because it just worked out that way. To me it seemed to be a more \u201csafer\u201d and more comfortable test than the race one. In my opinion, most people do not want to be labeled as a racist or prejudice toward race but, it\u2019s probably true that right now more men are in the science field than the arts field at least in my area. Again, I found the tests to be very engaging and if people really take the test seriously in some ways it could be a measurement for people to change their thought patterns related to certain prejudice about several different situations."
"Because they feel life begins at conception, they insist terminating a pregnancy is murdering a living human being. Pro-life advocates argue that these innocent human beings have the fundamental right to life that must be protected. A common example of this perception is the fact that no one would suggest that a mother kill her\u00a0three year old child because it\u2019s not big enough to have rights yet; Therefor, an infant in the womb should not be deprived of it\u2019s right to be born simply because it\u2019s too small."
"Belmont in contrast to Shylocks Venice is full of music. Starting with the music to accompany Bassanios choice, Portia tells us that \u201cmusic is/Even as\u00a0the flourish when true subjects bow/To a new crowned monarch.\u201d \u201cA Flourish of Cornets\u201d announces Morocco\u2019s entrance, his introduction to the caskets, and his exit. Arragon is introduced to the caskets by another flourish. A song accompanies Bassanios choice. In Act 5, Bassanio\u2019s \u2018tucket\u2019 heralds his victorious return to Belmont."
"Malaysia scores very high on this dimension (score of 104) which means that people accept a hierarchical order in which everybody has a place and which needs no further justification. Hierarchy in an organisation is seen as reflecting inherent inequalities, centralization is popular, subordinates expect to be told what to do and the ideal boss is a benevolent autocrat."
"Established institutions in society, such as the government, employers, and civil society, must take the lead to promote integration within their establishments (Modood, 2011: 4). For integration to take place, Modood asserts that citizen\u2019s rights and opportunities \u201cmust be made effective through anti-discrimination laws and policies\u201d (Modood, 2011: 4). Sergio Carrera and Anja Wiesbrock define civic integration, a relatively new extension of integration, as the \u201cstrong cultural and identitarian connotations on the juridical framing of the phenomena of human mobility and diversity\u201d (Carrera et al, 2009: 3)."
"You can trust them, with anything and everything. Best friends share tears and laughs, almost like their emotions are intertwined. Most importantly, you can always count on a best friend. \u201d One of my best friends, Kevin, has been there for me through the depressing times as well as the joyous times in life."
"Steinbeck raises questions in the mind of the reader that the novel would be based on loneliness. The first line read \u201cA few miles south of Soledad\u201d. This is a clever idea by Steinbeck as \u201cSoledad\u201d means loneliness in Spanish. The title \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d may be seen as a warning for the whole novel as it came from Robbie Burns\u2019s poem \u201cTo a Mouse\u201d which translates as `no matter how well be plan the future, things often go wrong\u2019."
"They didnt care if he was there or not so if he was lynched or canned, he could easily be replaced. They easily dismiss his rights like the time when the men were looking for a gun and someone said, \u201ctake that nigger\u2019s shot gun. \u201d they assumed that Crooks will permit them to use his gun, dismissing his rights and not thinking of Crooks\u2019s feelings."
"There has been a clash between the children\u2019s protection and participation rights. Protection rights protect the children against exploitation and abuse for the best interest of the child while in participatory rights; children take part in decisions concerning their lives and a right to freedom of conscious and to hold an opinion. Adults and their children\u2019s views may not always coincide. Many children\u2019s wishes and views are ignored by the adults for the best interest of the child. For instance; (CRC)"
"\u2013 using processes that do not involve random selection. Variables are used as a control to ensure the group selected meet the desired balance, however, by not using a random sample the results are less likely to yield accurate results than probability or random sampling. This sampling is usually less costly and can be completed over a shorter period of time which is beneficial compared with probability or random sampling when you only have a small population to work with."
"The association between the XYY syndrome and crime came from studies that suggested that XYY males had a disproportionate inclination to violent offences. Owen (1972) reviewed the evidence and suggested otherwise, describing a number of shortcomings with the research: including difficulties with the identification of the extra Y chromosome; the fact that the rate of XYY males in criminal populations is not radically different from non-criminal populations; poorly controlled measures of aggression and violence; and that sexual rather than violent offences appear to be more frequent with XYY males."
"Lastly, for varied reasons there are those who are looking an amount transitioning from one career option to another. despite that stage in life the individual makes a career call or transition, each events are difficult and since work has continually been an awfully huge a part of our lives, its significance on our well-being is simple. Thankfully, counselling will facilitate to cut back the burden of those challenges whereas serving to the individual build the correct career selection for them."
"For families who are homeless, this could be a huge encouragement as well as a steppingstone to a better life for them and their children. Throughout the school year, a family service specialist meets with the family to see where they are in fulfilling their yearly goal. If all school systems would adopt Head Start policies, we could be more involved in not just students\u2019 lives, but the family as well. This could help identify those children who are at most risk and could be a game-changer when dealing with our homeless population. We would be able to assist parents in planning to obtain suitable housing, and being about to keep housing, giving stability to not just children, but the family. Homeless students often lag far behind other children in poverty academically. They are coping with stigma and trauma. They also may not have access to basics such as food, clothing, a place to sleep and bathe, let alone school supplies."
"Prejudice of lots of groups of people prevailed in America throughout the Great Anxiety period. In the 1930s when the book occurred, there was a severe amount of racism and sexism, little to no understanding of psychological impairment, and assumedly a good deal of ageism. In _ Of Mice and Guy, _ John Steinbeck utilizes bias to highlight the style of alienation through ageism, bigotry, sexism, and ableism."
"The United States will forever and always be a nation of immigrants. Without the contributions of multiple generations of immigrants from every corner of the globe, the United States may not be the successful and strong economic powerhouse it is today. Compared to the rest of the world, the United States has the highest population numbers of legal and illegal immigrants. The united states is a place where anyone is welcome as long as they enter, live and work in the country legally."
"Imagine being the one on trial. You know you are innocent yet it seems as if everyone in that courtroom is rooting against you. What would you feel like? Unwanted? Scared? But why? All Tom ever did for Mayella is show her kindness. Tom Robinson is not guilty, he was just simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Tom could not of hit Mayella because he has no function of his left hand. All the beating was done to her right side. Proving it had to be a left handed man that struck her. Mayella also can\u2019t seem to get her story straight. At first she doesn\u2019t even recall to Tom ever hitting her. Tom has always been a good man, a good father to his kids, a good husband, and a good son. He wouldn\u2019t dare to do something so abhorrent. Bob Ewell is known to be the \u201cDisgrace of Maycomb\u201d. But since he is white and Tom is colored you believe Bob\u2019s word over Tom\u2019s. During this trial we need to put aside the racial differences and look at the fact that there is no possible way Tom beat and raped Mayella. Tom Robinson shouldn\u2019t not be convicted of this crime. He has kids and a wife. You all seem him as the man he, which certainly is not a big violent black man. Do the right thing. Do the thing Tom Robinson would do for all of you, help him in his time of need. He shouldn\u2019t have his whole life turned upside down because of some false accusations made against him."
"But although you readers might like this standard I must say it was not very common at all. Sadly, the typical mill or factory was the inhumane type, which parents of the children would hate, but would be too scared of complaining in fear of losing work and the small income that did come in at all. I think this type of mill was typical because whether you like it or not, it is what happened. And I strongly believe that from the evidence I have gathered this is the case. The evidence for my description comes from the internet, one website being www. cottontimes. co."
"However, many women believe that only they can decide what to do with their body. A woman is a person and she have the right to own body, to her own life, to happy motherhood, to a happy childhood, to desired children. Conforming to Law Teacher (2018) absolutely all women have the right to decide on abortion on their own, because the right to abortion is important for equality between men and women. Also, prohibition on legal abortion deprives a woman of the right to their own body and the right to dispose of their fate. Consequences of the prohibition of abortion can be extremely negative: from the birth of unwanted children to disability and even the death of women as a result of \u201cunderground\u201d operations for deprivation of pregnancy. In Ireland, there are many cases of \u201cself-dependent abortion\u201d since legal abortion is prohibited. As a result, women\u2019s mortality increased. The research showed that women were ordering pills on the internet which later proved deadly (Kindelan, 2018). Other cases \u201cself-dependent abortion\u201d were registered in Brazil, about 25% women wanted to kill a foetus with a hot bath, which led to bleeding as a result of which the women died (Human Rights Watch, 2017). According to Furedi (2016) access to abortion is part of women\u2019s reproductive health. The right to reproductive choice, family planning, protection of reproductive and sexual health relates to basic human rights. Reproductive rights include inalienable human rights and freedoms that are already recognized in national legislation, in international human rights instruments and other generally accepted documents. For the first time officially about reproductive rights was declared at the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), held in 1994 in Cairo (Linkages, 1994). The Convention on the Elimination of all forms of discrimination against Women explicitly requires that the participating states provide women with access to health service, including family planning services and decision-making about how many children they can have., as well as access to the information necessary for the exercise of these rights. Therefore, in the United States, every year, occur 20 million dangerous abortions, resulting in the death of more than 80,000 women, so this cannot be just a woman\u2019s choice, as it can lead to her death."
"Taylor and Abrahams convey childhood experiences in \u2018The Gold Cadillac\u2019 and \u2018Crackling Day\u2019 in many different ways, in the two stories the childhoods of the main characters are very different. The two stories were both set in very racist times. \u2018The Gold Cadillac\u2019 was set in the deep south of America in the 1950\u2019s."
"In the article, Nikole recounts the dilemma she had to go through while selecting a school for their daughter. Living in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, a community regarded to be of low-income and mostly inhabited by blacks, where schools primarily reflect New York\u2019s racial and economic disparities. Most of the students are either Blacks or Latinos, and the test results show how the section of the society gets marginalized. Systematic racism exists in schools, courts, and law enforcement agencies. Statistically, black children amount to 18 percent of preschoolers in the United States. However, interesting data is they also make 50 percent of suspension in the schools meaning, a black student is three times likely to get suspended than white children for a similar infraction."
"To belong is to be accepted, to be recognised, and to connect with others whether it may be with family, friends or culture. A sense of belonging is an instinctive human need in all of us as it gives us security, emotions whether they would be true or fake, and a connection or bond with others. Accepting or resisting belonging creates characteristics which define the individual. They are shown to have different forms of relationships with others in their life. Ultimately, these relationships whether based on artificial or real emotions, give the character a sense of identity and a sense of where they belong. Although it is seen as a vital requirement in everyday life, to belong is difficult as there are many barriers, and whether or not an individual can overcome these obstacles, it will essentially determine where the individual belongs. The experiences faced by the individuals also define their concept of belonging. There is always a place where everyone belongs."
"The whole poem is an apostrophe to the speaker\u2019s father. She directly addresses him more than once, and he is dead. This apostrophe illustrates power because a person has to be confident to directly address someone, but not in her case. She has power to confront a dead man, which is not really power at all. In line 29, she states \u201cI thought every German was you\u201d which justifies a reader believing that she is really trying to say that all men are the same; they are all evil. She comes back to that idea in line 71, \u201cIf I\u2019ve killed one man, I\u2019ve killed two.\u201d It\u2019s all the same because \u201call men are equal.\u201d In lines 34 through 40, the speaker relates herself to a Jew and a gypsy, two of the most hated groups by the Nazis. If the reader goes back to the metaphor of her father being Hitler, it is evident that she wants to be a Jew or a gypsy so that her father will hate her. She hates him so mush that she wants him to despise her as well. She also wants to rebel as much as possible. If her father were Hitler, and she were a Jewish gypsy, she would be beyond rebellious. Lines 53 through 54, \u201cA cleft in your chin instead of your foot / But no less a devil for that, no not\u201d are an allusion to the supposed fact that cleft hooves are a characteristic of the Devil. His cleft may be in his chin, but he is still evil. Line 67, \u201cAnd I said I do, I do\u201d is explaining that she is now married and is under the influence of some other man. He may be evil, but he is at least not her father."
"I believe that it is essential to pursue a subject in which one not only has the aptitude to excel but also finds a natural interest. For myself, I find that engineering is a field that serves both purposes. It is fascinating to explore the technical properties of our surroundings and the internal mechanism of the devices we use every day. As physics deals with the rudimentary mechanics of the world, I have found physics and mathematics significantly more interesting than any other subject from a young age. These subjects pose everyday questions which can be solved through logical deduction, and I find the application of theoretical knowledge to understand the world around me to be intensely engaging. Physics is a subject which helps me understand the world around me. From the rolling of a ball to the mechanism of a motor, there was not a single topic that I could not relate to."
"The men that work on the ranch find her desperate for attention and someone to talk to. Steinbeck never mentions her name in the book because it is a literature technique to make the audience realise she doesn\u2019t deserve her own identity. Page: 1 of 2 Also the men don\u2019t even use her name, often calling her mean things, in which showing how the people around us can be so cruel. Many times in \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d, the worker group rejects Lennie because he is intellectually hindered. This occurs when Curley attempts to pick a fight with Lennie because he thinks that Lennie isn\u2019t very strong, and how wrong he was. Also another instance when the farmer group ridicules Lennie is when the all go into town to the brothel and leave Lennie behind. Even George says he doesn\u2019t want to be with him at times because he is such a hassle to George. \u201cWhen I think f the swell time I could have without you, I go nuts\u201d, this quote shows that George is at times quite harsh towards Lennie because he mentally challenged."
"When he got tired of these exchanges of smiles between his wife and other people, he \u201cgave commands;/ Then all smiles stopped together (Browning, lines 45-46).\u201d This ambiguous statement gives the reader a clue as to how the Duchess became an ex-wife. It is not specific, however, so that one can only guess as to what happened\u2014maybe he had her killed or sent her away where she died."
"Betrayal didn\u2019t only kill friendships but it caused family relationships to also die. When talking to her friends about children Hannah says to them \u201cSure you do. You love her, I like love, Sula. I just don\u2019t like her. That\u2019s the difference\u201d, Sula hearing those words from her own mother made her \u201cfly up the stairs.\u201d Hannah completely betrays Sula in this instance. A mother is supposed to be a role model for their children but instead, Hannah just talks about her own flesh and blood. At a young age, hearing such a thing from your own mother can make a person feel devastated and grow up with stored anger because of the rejection when they when they were younger. Talking behind Sula back and saying hurtful demonstrates the betrayal between mother and daughter."
"The problem with the American school system stems from the ineffectiveness of the teachers and the inability of parents to deal with their children who are struggling but do not receive the right help until it is too late. In particular, students will dropout or give up on their educational and career goals because of one bad grade, which results from the defective educational system in America, which is ranked by the PISA Programme for International Student Assessment) at the level of 38\u2033 in math and 24 in science out of 71 countries."
"Throughout the collection Duffy casts an ironic eye on heterosexual relationships; she gives the woman the dominating voice and the upper hand. Duffy also explores the anger and even horror involved in failed or dysfunctional relationships, for example the horror of the relationship between the Devil and the Devil\u2019s Wife. In \u2018The Worlds Wife\u2019 heterosexuality is rejected, and homosexuality is affirmed. Meaningful relationships tend to be found in communities of women."
"There have been many cases in which people know how big the number of innocent people that have been executed in the United States. It has been proven that people have confessed to crimes they haven\u2019t done. There have been cases where evidence was presented of someone\u2019s innocence has been uncovered after the person was executed."
"It appears that the purpose of each article was different, which caused the way they were written to also be different to some degree. Social Studies for Kids was to provide information to the readers. The NPR interview provided information as well as causing the reader to reflect on a past event and apply what they learn to help improve the future. Reading and comparing these two articles was a great example of how the same event can be interpreted in different ways but still give you valuable information."
"On the web. Article, \u2018U.S Teen Pregnacy and Abortion Rate\u2019, shows the reader that highest percentage are teen the age group 18-19 have the percentage of 72 % abortion performed in the united states. But have dropped since 2003 with the percentage of 17.9 aborrtion performed. I would use this article to show the percentage of abortion, but not only teen other groups aswell as race, ethincy, and cathlic schools. Rainey, R.Randal, and MagillGerard. Abortion and public policy: an interdisciplinary investigation within the Catholic tradition. Omaha, 1996. This book provides Analysis on the debate of the united state and the Cathlic ways. This book show the argument of the political and cathlic on the topic on abortion. I will use this in my essay to show both sides of politics and the cathlic\u2019s tradition."
"Throughout the story the mother and the father are in conflict, even opposes, the most significant is the way they raises there kids. The mother believe her children her should be brought up the same way she was, following the same tradition he had, living a similar life she did and would not be satisfied otherwise. She sees the fathers love for literature has a huge waste of time and becomes extremely angry at her children for following in their fathers foot stapes."
"\u2018With us it ain\u2019t like that. We got a future. We got somebody to talk to that gives a damn about us\u2026If them other guys gets in jail they can rot for all anybody gives a damn. But not us\u2019 says George. This quote that George said is great friendship because not once did he say just himself, he also said Lennie was with him."
"2\u00a0The team at Spencer Owens was proud of their company\u2019s commitment to fairness and equality and to encourage the employees to be \u201ccolorblind\u201d to gender and ethnic differences. Along with this strategy, the firm also initiated sensitivity training and held follow-up discussions. Multiple employees commented, \u201cEveryone is the same and treated the same.\u201d With feedback from these trainings and discussions, the firm went a step further to create networking groups for women and people of color."
"When Will meets Skylar she is unlike any girl he has ever known, and as their relationship grows serious, Will\u2019s fear of commitment supports his struggle with his identity status. After Will receives Skylar\u2019s number he is not contemplating commitment nor immediately calls her. Psychologically he is at the stage of moratorium where he delays decisions about Skylar before going out with her again as well as not disregarding his options with other woman, as he tells his psychologist Sean that he has slept with many woman. However, when Will takes Skylar to the dog track he proves his committal to her as his girlfriend, which supports the proceeding identity status of foreclosure. Next, after their relationship grows serious, Skylar asks Will to come to California with her as she attends Stanford yet Will refuses her offer and feels the need to distance himself from her."
"High blood pressure has been the deadly killer in the Merriweather family for generations and generations. High blood pressure, (also known as hypertension), is cause when the pressure in the arteries is higher than it should. The heart siphons blood into the veins and the power of the blood pushing against vein dividers is called circulatory strain. Corridors convey the blood all through the body (Langford, 2018). Having high blood pressure is dangerous in many ways. One way is that it influences the heart to need to work more earnestly so as to pump the blood to the body."
"\u2019 Children often \u2018imitate\u2019 their guardians and some people may even believe this to be the way of development of a person. Lennie may need George to create stability for the future but Lennie\u2019s mimicry isn\u2019t to just fit in with the civilized world. Steinbeck implies from the innocent actions by Lennie, that he genuinely admires George."
"By comparing her new place of residence to a hole, Saroj feels trapped or exiled within this alien land, proving to be the motive for her resentment. Saroj displays her regret when she wishes to have stayed in India by saying that she would have been happier there thus providing a reason for her refusal to find happiness in her new environment. Similarly in Monica Ali\u2019s novel Brick Lane, Chanu Ahmed was asked for permission by his wife, Nazeen, to attend English lessons and here he demonstrate the characteristic of resentment: Your going to be a mother\u2026Will that not keep you busy enough?\u00a0And you can\u2019t take a baby to college. Babies have to be fed; they have to have their bottoms cleaned. It\u2019s not so simple as that. Just to go to college, like that."
"This paper discusses some studies about the influence of animated characters in television advertisements. These studies discuss if this technique may lead to brand preferences, what emotions and feelings it evokes, how the companies use animation in advertisements and the responses of children towards these advertisements. Some of the trends in the use of animated characters in television advertising have changed during time. The use of animated characters is a technique which has been used for quite some time now, and the changes during this time are mainly technical oriented."
"Finally, friendship means that the parties are not opportunists. When friends trust each other, it means that at any time that one friend falls in trouble the other will help without having a second thought. One should be free in the sharing of secrets and emotions without any fear of being betrayed."
"On the other hand, when positive influences are not present children will be shy about choosing their own activities to participate in. Children will develop shyness about themselves Stories such as I Want Your Moo by Marcella Bakur Weiner helps children develop positive self esteem as they focus on their own strong points. I Want Your Moo by Marcella Bakur Weiner is a story about a turkey who grumbles and complains about her appearance and her gobble. So she tries to get the others animals to give her their noises."
"The Health Belief model is set up on the belief that individuals are logical in the way they think and perceive things, and will choose the right option to maintain and strengthen their health dependant upon certain principles. These include being able to perceive the negative impact on their health, believing that in undertaking the task their will be a positive outcome and the belief that they have the commitment and are able to undertake the task required, (Changing Works, 2018). The lifestyle factors of Mrs A can be reflected on relating to the health belief model. This is due to Mrs A still smoking over sixty years, regardless of the education she has found out over time and the serious health complication she has had throughout her life including a stroke, hypertension, COPD and a hemorrhage. She has had many health issues as consequence of the negative choices that she has made that has impact her health, regardless of this she has still continued to smoke."
"Yet, with this privilege of learning has came a decline in our education system. The lack of adequate teachers, the high rise in disrespect for authority, just the lack of caring whether you learn or not has affected our education system. A hundred years ago the thought of a higher education was just a dream for most. If you acquired a fifth grade reading level you were doing good."
"All of these caused the relation between this two race are ever controvertial. In the film \u2018Sepet \u2018 that is a scene the Protagonist \u2018s ( Jason ) friend attempt to carry Jason the relation between him and Heroine ( Orked ) is forbiden. Which clearly potrait the head set of Chinese about the relationship of the interacial twosome. ( See figure 8 ) ."
"Gittany become violent towards officers in his family home when officers attempted to arrest Gittany, leading him to bite and sever the ear of Detective Senior Keith Bristow as well as attacking another officer Constable David Burgess. Documents in court also report that at the time of arrest Gittany\u2019s mother also attacked Constable Burgess. In 2000, the offender Gittany aged 27, was once again in trouble with the law."
"All of these measures for protecting data offline demonstrate that securing data has more to do with logic and sound judgment rather having to incur huge costs that could have been directed elsewhere. One should always be conscious of what type of personal information is being shared online. Computer hard drives retain information and any experienced hacker with enough knowledge of your personal details can access this information without your knowledge."
"Both of these situations determine very different viewpoints, but how do we know which theory can be considered ethically moral ? There are many possible reasons a woman might choose to have an abortion, for example: to avoid interruption of life goals, the pregnancy is a result of rape, or to prevent birth of abnormal or diseased child, just to name a few. It is also obvious why some may consider abortion to be morally problematic, whether the reasons are based on religion, and the values of life. The truth is that each one of us is forced to decide how we feel about abortion, as we are with any ethical issue. So, the question remains, Pro-life or Pro-choice ?"
"You can respect someone else\u2019s religion by trying to understand their beliefs and their point of view of the world, you don\u2019t have to agree with it and you don\u2019t need to practice it but you do not need to disrespect it if you strongly disagree or attempt to make them change their religion simply because you do not agree with theirs."
"This proves that Tocqueville is predictions were perhaps accurate because Native Americans are still not accepted by the American society. African-Americans are still being seen as inferior to white races such as the Ku Klux Klan who were perhaps are the most extreme methods to prevent black and white desegregation and integration.[1] This proves that Tocqueville predictions on African-American could have been accurate with the integration of black and white could cause some institutionalized segregation in the American society. In opposition Tocqueville\u2019s predictions on African-Americans it seem that African-Americans in the contemporary United States has had importance\u00a0contributions to the American society and rest of the world with highly respected significant Black leaders such as Civil Rights main leader Martin Luther-King [2] who fights for his rights, equalities of other black Americans so that will see treated and respected in the same way as white American. Tocqueville predictions of African-American could be far from accurate as the current president of America who is African-American, Barack Obama who rules over the whole United States shows that African-American has now their own identities, well-educated and potentially the white collar job of the American society."
"Let\u2019s state, when your friends welcomes you over to their home, you do not just rush in and attack the refrigerator, licking the internal structure tidy, or rush into the master bed room and begins bouncing on their parents\u2019 bed because for your details, a bed is not a trampoline, no matter what the ads tell you, I can guarantee you that they are 2 different things. Idiotic acts such as attacking your buddy\u2019s refrigerator or bouncing on their moms and dads\u2019 bed clearly shows that you do not, and I repeat, DO NOT genuinely appreciate your buddy."
"The American South, especially in from the 1930s to the 1960s, is a hard place to live for when you are a \u201ccolored person. \u201d This novel, written by James McBride, discovers the complexities of having a bi-racial activity, especially at a time when blacks and other minorities are hated and discriminated upon by the dominant white society."
"An alternate relation between and mental stability comes from the aftermath. After Sandy Hook many counselors were sent to schools around the country to try and allow students to cope with what had recently happened in Connecticut. Regardless if the students were at Sandy Hook or not there were people who suffered and were traumatized by this event. Gun regulations need to be put in place to prevent guns reaching the hands of people who are mentally unstable and to prevent mass shootings in order to preserve the innocence of the next generation."
"Well, eventually, my mom found out and killed me, like I knew she would. She was so heated she told me to get out of her house. Not having anywhere else to go I went to Brittney\u2019s house where she and her mother comforted me for the next four days. My mom loves me dearly, but was very upset with me and needed some time to cool off. Like me, Brittney has been the typical teenager as well, only her \u201coops\u201d was a baby; not a mistake, but a blessing, Brittney got pregnant at the end of our senior year in high school. I was there 100 percent to help her deal and prepare for what was soon to come."
"Interest of the audiences and depth in certain characters and the events they are involved in or environments they are in can be grabbed by the use of camera angles. In the end the audience is engaged more and ends up getting a deeper understanding of the issues within the film. Within many of the courtroom scenes in \u2018Snow Falling on Cedars\u2019 Hicks uses these camera techniques. For example the Japanese community all sit behind Miyamoto and the camera angles used when focusing in on them often tends to be high and as a result it seems as if the audience are looking down on them from above."
"An article on CNN website states that in El Cajon California a man was shoot due to the fact that he was \u201cacting weird,\u201d also the fact that he reached in his pocket to pull out a vape and began to hand it to the police, It was immediately following that movement when the officer shot this man. Apparently he was mourning the loss of a friend, yet these officers saw him reach for his pocket and automatically assumed that he was going to shoot them. This has sadly been the case in more than just a few shootings The response to this problem is typically the assumption that All Police and racist and unnecessarily violentt This is also not the case. Yes most of the police involved in these shootings did not have reasonable evidence to shoot these black victims."
"When Dana confronts Rufus in the next scene on page 208, he hits her across the face when she refuses to go back inside the Weylin home, which is illustrated with lines portraying Rufus\u2019 arm motion and with yellow streaks to signify the impact of his hand hitting her face. Consequently, this artwork helps to realistically show how forceful and violent Rufus was when he hit Dana, and I think it also metaphorically shows the turning point in their relationship, as Dana notes that \u201cHe\u2019d never hit her before\u201d (208), and it was \u201cso surprising, she stumbled and fell\u201d (208). In the next panel, Rufus yells at Dana and the background is completely shaded red, which represents his anger towards Dana. Also, Rufus\u2019 speech balloon in this panel is jagged instead of round, implying that he is screaming at her instead of normally speaking to her. Similarly, black lines surround his head, emphasizing how loud he was screaming at her to go back to the house."

"Donors and well-wishers should get annual or even monthly reports of how the money they donate is being used in the children\u2019s home. This will allow the donors to know what to donate next to make the children\u2019s home better for the children. By not being accountable; some home gets too many donations example Bishop Locati Luigi Children\u2019s home once got too many sanitary towels and they all expired at once and were not useable."
"Two corporations who have implemented diversity efforts and have dealt with the benefits and challenges of these efforts are Spencer Owens & Co. and Cityside Financial Services. When examining both diversity efforts, it is important to understand how well each company has done with previous and present efforts, the problems the companies are facing now and the root causes of these problems. While these companies have implemented their own efforts to diversify their staff, it is important to examine the similarities and differences in managing diversity."

"I smiled and answered the puzzle. \u201cA dog\u2019s paw print may look the same but their nose print is actually as unique as a human fingerprint. The combination of ridges and creases are so distinct that it can actually be used to identify them.\u201d \u201cOOOOh the kid said in unison.\u201d"
"Another stereotypical character is represented in Joey, he\u2019s the typical male slob; his laziness, and forgetfulness often leads to him missing his auditions. For instance, in this episode he forgets to go to the parade with the rest of the \u2018Days of our Lives\u2019 cast, this could lead to him getting fired. He is a talented actor but he is stereotypically not able to achieve his full potential because of the lack of professionalism, his male qualities often hold him back. He is represented as almost childlike."
"The city of London plays host to a number of large parks including the HydePark and Holland Park where your dog gets ample space to play off-leash. Further, public buses and trains are welcoming to pooches. Though most cafeterias and stores have strict dog policies, the majority of the pubs allow dogs, with spacious beer gardens where your pup can relax in comfort."
"The descriptors he uses to describe the fear and the beating heart are extremely powerful. The reader may find it hard to determine whose heart is actually beating loudly and rapidly; the story teller, the man with the strange eye or the reader. The ticking of the watch and the pounding of the heart create powerful imagery. This story is told in first person from the murderer\u2019s point of view. The story has very little dialogue, but is told with such passion that it was not obvious until searching for quotation marks."
"Political injustice is experienced by men when contacting emergency services. Often when men have called for help, they have been asked what they had done to provoke the woman to act the way she did. This would leave men to feel as though they are the ones in the wrong and dismiss the idea that they could be the victim. Quite a few men including admit they didn\u2019t report the violence as they were afraid of what would happen to their children and what other people would also think of them. Many men have also said when they had previously reported the abuse, they were removed from the premises as though they were the ones in the wrong. When women have been in the same positions, the emergency services acted immediately and urged the women to have domestic violence orders placed on their partners. Thus, showing clear examples of the political injustices and inequalities that men experience when emergency services don\u2019t take their claims seriously in domestic violence situations."
"According to (Cameron: blog) \u201cAdolescents who commit murder should suffer consequences since they are old enough to know right from wrong. Most, however, are unable to understand the total repercussions of their acts on themselves or their victims. Real justice is not a life for \u2018a life,\u2019 especially a life that has just begun.\u201d\u201d Their immaturity, less education, and less intelligence make the teenager almost incapable of evaluating the aftermath of their conduct on other hand they are being led by emotion or peer pressure than is an adult. The reasons why juveniles are not trusted with the same responsibilities of an adult are also why their careless conduct is not as morally wrong in contrast to an adult\u201d (Bartollas and Schmallager 79)."
"Yet, I was too scared to jump ship and risk looking like a quitter on my application; therefore, I kept attending to the same mundane and pointless meetings. Extracurricular activities play a significant role in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, but I fail to see why they should affect the admission process. From a young age, I was taught not to flaunt any service I offer, but rather do it in humility and secrecy. However, when it came to college applications, I found myself doing the exact opposite and felt quite ashamed of having to sell how good of a person I am. In terms of my GPA, I took huge personal risks and full advantage of what my school had to offer. When I told my parents about my plan to take numerous AP classes, they hesitated and replied that it is better to be safe than sorry. When I told my peers that I was aiming for valedictorian or saledoctrian during my freshman year, I got a pity smile back. People\u2019s reactions bothered me, but they also inspired me to work harder in order to prove them wrong. By my sophomore year, I was enrolled in two AP courses and an honor class. In both my junior and senior year, I was enrolled in five AP courses each and also studying for one independently."
"An article in The Australian on April 26th 2010 titled \u2018Indigenous media goes under the microscope,\u2019 explores Indigenous media in regards to government funding. The story explains that the government will be reviewing all directly funded Indigenous Media organisations. The apparent focus of the review is to ascertain whether public funding was providing the best possible outcomes for the Indigenous. From reading the story, I can identify the racial stereotyping not only from the content, but from the story structure also."
"Setting the games and activities within an environment that supports communication enhances them even further. To support this idea there is an additional set of activities to help teachers and parents create an environment which supports communication. Sometimes just being more aware of language and communication can help to make the small changes that have the biggest impact on children\u2019s speaking and listening.

"Crooks was the only black person on the ranch and there was only one other black family in the area. As Crooks says \u201cIf I say something it is just a nigger sayin\u2019 it.\u201d (page 80) Crooks at first turns Lennie away from his room saying \u201cyou got no right to come in my room.\u201d (page 77) but due to Lennie\u2019s \u2018disarming smile\u2019 (page 77) he gives in and invites him in. When Crooks realises about the dream of the farm he wants to be part of it, offering to work for nothing. \u201cIf you\u2026guys would want a hand to work for nothing \u2013 just his keep, why I\u2019d come an\u2019 lend a hand.

"Yellowstone national park is the first national park in the world. By next year, the park will be celebrating its 140 years. The park measures 2.2million acres [21] . The area was sparsely populated at the time of starting the park but the government had an oversight that of how things will be in future. unclear Inside the designated area there was human settlings mostly made up of Native Indians and a few Frontier farmers. You\u2019ve said this already The government acquired all private land within the demarcated area and evacuated the people. The Native Indians having lived in this area did not welcome the relocation. However the government ensured they do. [?] This left the Indians bitter. To revenge the Indians continued hunting in the protected area as if unaware the new change of status. They also attacked the tourist who came to visit. This prompted the government to send the Calvary troops there in 1886 to stop poaching and to protect the tourist [22] . The Calvary soldiers went to Yellowstone and built Fort Yellowstone where they stayed until 1916 when the National Park Service (NPS) was established through the Organic Act of 1916. You\u2019ve said much of this already. Please combine the same points in one area of the paper."
"My classroom usually has between twenty three to twenty five students ever year. In the past several years we have had to share Arabic teachers because we do not have enough. In this case being able to meet all twenty five students\u2019 individual needs has been a struggle for me. Also having special needs in my classroom and no special needs program to help me, a lot of my extra energy was spent with them. I try to balance by having groups set up by academic level, but even within those groups I struggled to find ways to address all individual strengths and weaknesses."
"people with rickets may have weak and soft bones, stunted growth, and in sever case, skeletal deformities. vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium and phosphate from your intestines. You can get vitamin D from various food products, including milk, eggs, and fish. Your body also produces the vitamin when you\u2019re exposed to sunlight.A vitamin D deficiency makes it difficult for your body to maintain sufficient levels of calcium and phosphate. When this occurs, your body produces hormones that cause calcium and phosphate to be released from your bones."
"The characters in the novella, \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d can relate to this trend as it is set during that era. All the characters in the book are experiencing poverty at the time and are working to continue existence and to vanquish the Great Depression, so that they can obtain the dream."
"It could also be said to be representing a chocking motion, hindering her speech, showing relative frightened emotions of talking to this man. Towards the end of the poem, it becomes questionable who the male figure is that she speaks about in the poem. It could be related to her father or, to her husband, the poet Ted Hughes. There\u2019s an element of marital explanation, \u201cAnd I said I do, I do. \u201d This implies that Plath is speaking about her husband, telling the reader that she also felt oppressed during her years of marriage."
"Professors are expressing a concern over students actions during their class time. Students find that because they are paying for college, they have more freedom. Although freedom is given, a certain conduct should be kept within the classroom. Paying attention, being prepared, and attendance should be something students can handle on their own. However, professors notice a lack of civility within their own classroom. Civility should be a policy in colleges to ensure that professors and peers receive respectful treatment."
"The division between races between people were lessening, and the thought of a human race were expanding. They fought for their own rights and they fought for each other\u2019s rights, because they realized all minorities at the time were going through the same struggle. \u201d I believe that it is important for every American to know their history, even if it has nothing to do with their color or ethnicity: since events such as the Third World Strike influenced some of your fellow Americans, these same events indirectly influenced you as well\u201d."
"Police officers are often under credited by the media. The media crops out real stories of people when being arrested or detained by police officers. These are some questions one should think about when viewing these kinds of videos: what did the person do to be arrested? How were the officers provoked? What actions of the detainee caused the police officer to use excessive force-whether it be resisting arrest or assaulting a police officer? People often use stereotypes against officers due to their image portrayed by the media. A stereotype is a held assumption about a group of people due to an individual\u2019s cultural beliefs. An example of a stereotype commonly held is that police are only males. This is a popular stereotype because there are not much female policemen portrayed in the media. Another stereotype is that police use guns to handle situations. This stereotype is popular because of the fact that there have been many instances that showcase the police using their guns to handle a situation. Stereotypes, however, often influence and limit an individual\u2019s thinking. In addition, these stereotypes can lead to a fallacy known as hasty generalization, which occurs when there is a generalization of a subject based on a small sample. For example, if a citizen has been exposed to too much news about the police using improper tactics and actions, the citizen may feel threatened by the police and not ask for their help. They may also view these authoritative figures negatively. Instead of creating these hasty generalizations, it is important for an individual to think critically about this issue and examine various points of the situation."
"The systems of family counseling argue that the in-house forces of the arrangement of the unit of the\u00a0 family can generate and maintain problematic conducts in the members of the family. All family counseling strategies are devised to assist families progress coping skills, problem-resolving, and communication, and improve their sense of relation to each other (Moore & Neiderhiser, 2014). The intention of this essay is to compare and contrast the Structural and the post-Milan family counseling strategies, especially their conjectures on the causes of family issues. The essay will seriously scrutinize, synthesize and assess arguments and concepts in the academic literature and present a coherent, persuasive case that both the Milan family counseling approach and the structural family therapy confront dysfunctionality in the construction of the family. Nonetheless, in the Milan approach, it is done with an enhanced participation of the counselor. The way transformation and growth take place in the structural family therapy model is disparate than in the Milan systemic family therapy strategy as it takes places by opening substitute patterns of relationships that can make over the configuration of the family. It further asserts the Structural counseling approach of alteration does not rule out other strategies of transformation and structural counselors can operate alongside other remedial strategies to modification as a component of a coordinated pack up of therapy."
"The plaything and games industry sectors are classs in nine units that are as follows ( Key Note. 200711 ) : ? Infant/pre-school plaything and games merchandises for under 5year olds? Activity toys? Outdoors/sport toys and games? Games/puzzles? Dolls? Action toys? Vehicles? Plush toys? Other Products The plaything and game industry class sectors are earning the selling attack to be designated by mark demographic and locations to render the most trade name equity to a profitableness standing ( Chitty.

"Lastly, Gettysburg played a significant role in the Civil War. The Gettysburg is depicted as a significant part in America\u2019s history. Prior to the Gettysburg War, the Confederacy had won a significant number of wars. However, Gettysburg acted as a turning point for the course of the Civil War. At Gettysburg, the Union gained their first victory in the War. Consequently, they gained momentum in the War and won all the subsequent wars. The Gettysburg War depleted the two sides\u2019 reserves for the War; it significantly decreased their ammunition and number of soldiers. The North had double, the number of soldiers as the South; additionally, it was more industrialized compared to the South. Thus, the North eventually lost the War due to the lack of resources. This contrasted any other war that had been fought prior to the Gettysburg War."
"The data were analyzed using the statistical package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 20 version. Descriptive statistics were presented through frequencies and percentages for quantitative data through tables, graphs, pie charts and histograms and the qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis.

"Scientists, Change, Inventions, Einstein, Newton, Climate, Elements. . . . . . . . . Sounds SCIENCE right? Actually, all things here that we feel, see, hear, taste, and smell are related to it. It also maybe the cause of some or maybe the real cause of environmental, health, economical, industrial, and agricultural problems. So, many of us blame that technology which is the application of science destruct the Earth. YOU! Can you consider it as a friend or an enemy? For my very own opinion, SCIENCE is everyone\u2019s friend."
"The great Erik Erikson once said, \u201cIn the social jungle of human existence, there is no feeling of being alive without a sense of identity\u201d.First of all, the identity of the children is gradually stripped from them. The children were in a situation where they had no choice but to grow and grow up quickly."
"\u201d. This piece of Evidence shows that Sula just sitting there watching her own mom struggle to stay alive even though she is burning up in the fire connotes the evilness of Sula. For humans, It would be completely natural for us to save and protect our families, especially, our mom; so Sula just finding enjoyment just to see her mom suffer isn\u2019t normal. \u201c She was pariah, then, and knew it."
"By beneficence, it means happiness to many. Abortion can be viewed from different ethical -standpoint. One of such view is utilitarianism. The morale behind the rule of utilitarianism is the highest amount of happiness for the largest amount of people. Based on the empirical evidence, utilitarianism support wide spread happiness of many. Analyzing abortion in this context, one can see the medical, social, and economic benefit, it brings to the great amount of people in the society. The following is some of the statistics: * Half of all the pregnancies in the U.S are unintentional and \u00bd of these are terminated by medically safe legal abortions."
"Family therapy often implements exercises and techniques from behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, interpersonal therapy, and other kinds of individual therapy. The types of treatments and techniques used are tailored to each client and their specific problems. The length of the client\u2019s therapy depends on their financial and personal situations. Talking to a family counselor has so many therapeutic uses such as: healing pain from past experiences, learning how to handle emotions like anger, grief, or fear, building self-confidence,"
"Despite the progress made since the Civil Rights Movement for the equality of African Americans of the 1950s and 1960s, there is one area in particular that remains difficult to change. For many years, African Americans have been oppressed by white men. It wasn\u2019t until 1865 that they were freed from their masters. In today\u2019s modern day, we are seeing a conflict between law enforcement officials and society. Law enforcement officials, like all people, have drawbacks and the situations they encounter almost daily can be dangerous and almost always require fast responses."
"The Aboriginal population. now well much smaller. had trouble when turn outing ownership and power over their fatherland. European colonists were now stronger and could claim districts easy. This contributed non merely to the enlargement of the European colonists and to the growing of their power. but besides to the issue of subjugation in Australia. Every twenty-four hours. people around the universe of all races. genders. ages and civilizations are faced with the debasement and agony of racism and subjugation. Australia\u2019s Aboriginals and posterities are most surely no alien to these dismaying issues."
"But nonetheless, it\u2019s there, and we all have to go through finding ourselves at one point in time no matter how long we wait to do it. \u201cWe eventually lie down in that notoriously uncomfortable bed, the one we make ourselves. Whatever we chose to do, what path to follow, we one day face ourselves, take a look in the mirror. Whether we like what we see and are proud of it, or we run away and hide, never becoming what we are meant to become. Our own self-respect is based on our values, but what we chose and make to be our values\u2026"
"Since the beginning of its history, Malaysia has been a meeting place for a diverse range of external cultures and religions. As a result of these external influences, a new unified but distinguished Malay culture has emerged. Contemporary Malaysia represents a unique fusion of Malay, Chinese, and Indian traditions, creating a pluralistic and multicultural nation that has its character strongly rooted in social harmony, religion and pride in its ancestral background. With such a rich cultural heritage, acquiring the relevant skills and cultural knowledge in order to conduct business in Malaysia is crucial to your success."
"Missouri\u2019s application to become a slave state caused a major debate between pro-slavery people and Anti-slavery people. To keep peace among the North and the South Missouri\u2019s request was granted but also admitted Maine as a free Slave state. The Missouri Compromise also helped with established new free slave state, and slave state territories, they did this by implementing a boundary across the former Louisiana territory."
"According to the CNN Wire Staff, the city of San Bernardino in California went into bankruptcy in the year of 2012 (\u201cSan Bernardino Files for Bankruptcy\u201d 1). As a result, different ethnic groups were blaming racial groups for this situation. A couple of days later, I heard an Anglo-Saxon American leader of a business association blaming African Americans and Hispanics for the bankruptcy. He blamed African Americans communities for wasting money and having countless babies that took a lot of money to maintain."
"In terms of being the head of the household, it is still in practice that the dominant, which is the man, will be the head of the household. However, the as years go by people change along with their practices that woman gain their status as equal of man. Therefore, equality of authority inside the household is in practice although it only follows to the old tradition."
"That kind of happiness endures and does not decrease with the changing conditions of time. It sees us through every difficulty, every loss, every hardship, and it brightens even our best days. Do you believe in the saying that \u201cwe are the authors of every next moment? \u201d meaning, we are the reason who we are now, that \u201ceverything that happens to me, is the best possible thing that happened\u201d as the Dhammpada states \u201cAll that we are is the result of what we have thought. It is founded on our thoughts; it is made up of our thoughts. In our daily life, we have principles that became the foundation of our daily life decisions, we believed to something that became who we are. We have the control of our life, and everything that is happening and will happen to us is because of our philosophy, our principle. As stated in the book, \u201cWe are the powerful beings, creating our futures with our thoughts and actions. We are the mechanism by which life is controlled, and by our personal philosophy, which determines how we respond to those events\u201d."
"Our culture tends to marginalize this subject because the majority of the people that live in America are white and usually white people don\u2019t experience any kind of discrimination by their professor or teacher, so they find no reason to make a fuss about something that doesn\u2019t hurt or involve them. White culture finds it difficult to defend students who were pointed at by a teacher/professor since they don\u2019t understand what it means to be stereotyped by your skin color or the size of your eyes. One wouldn\u2019t blame the actions of a teacher/professor on students. Yet, when a video of an individual student goes viral on the internet that shows the educator criticizing a student, it\u2019s more likely everyone would defend the educators, saying \u201che/she probably didn\u2019t mean it in a racist way.\u201d That might be true; however, the educators need to be educated about her/his students\u2019 culture and have a background about the place they came from. Not all stereotyping seems terrible to the educators, as some of them think that stereotyping Asians by saying \u201cyou guys are geniuses at math,\u201d sounds like a good compliment, but what if that student was in particular not good at math, did that teacher ever think of how that student would feel at that moment? Expect students to be good at something because of their cultural background, which could lead the student to drop out of school/college because of the pressure they were put into."
"In a modern world, change is inevitable. We need to adopt these changes and update ourselves every day to make our life easier. The same is the case with business entities or organizations. An organization should always follow the market trend and make changes within the organization. Planned changes usually have a positive impact and it is goal-oriented and intentional. But unplanned and sudden changes in an organization will have a negative impact and stressful to handle it. Someone likes to have order, balance, predictability, uniformity and certain equilibrium in his life find very hard to adopt changes suddenly or more frequently. So, we have to follow a certain set to procedures or rules while adopting changes like taking suggestion or feedback from the employees about change or implementing changes in small group and examining it."
"Many big name companies are making money at our children expense not just by giving out toys with the purchase of a kid\u2019s meal, they also advertise themselves on Tv on average five food related commercials are air per hour, most featuring junk food (Galea Np). Parent need to take action and stop anybody or anything from trying to entice or manipulate their kids into doing or buying something. Parents need to take control and put a limit on how much Tv they can watch (Murphy Np). This will not only decrease the propaganda from the junk food, it will also make kids do something productive."
"Corporal punishment infringes the right to equal protection by allowing children to be physically attacked in the name of discipline. Every child has the right to be entitled to protection from abuse, exploitation, and violence. (UNICEF, 2011). These three factors can influence the child\u2019s transition to adulthood with adverse consequences later in life. With that, even a mild corporal punishment reflects a great invasion of rights and discrimination against children."
"I\u2019m glad we continued on this journey and arrived at our destination. We spent that week strolling along on the beach, went swimming with dolphins and exploring different water sports. There was a moment I asked myself, \u201cAm I having fun? Is this a good vacation? And the answer was a definite \u201cyes\u201d. It is the relationship that we developed as a family that was the real adventure. When I reminisce on those times, no matter how badly the vacation started, you don\u2019t want to miss the journey on how you arrive there. That is the real adventure. There were those moments when I talked with my son and he agreed he had the best adventure ever. I certainly do not regret this road trip almost not taken."
"Their lack of class consciousness causes them to have increased social agency- despite the positivity that the brothers have they seem to, for the most part, end up in the same types of financial situations as the negative Hallway Hangers. The conditions of the economy contributed to the hardships that the men faced. Minimum wage fluctuated between the 1980\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s. Housing prices rose, etc. These conditions combined with race, class, culture and capital all contributed to the ending circumstances of all of the men. The achievement ideology states that a good education will bring a great career and wealth. However, it is established that having the right contacts is even more necessary when it comes to winning a well-paying job. Who you know is very important as well as \u201cwho knows you\u201d. A(n) (potential) employer\u2019s perception of who you are matters when it comes to whether or not they want to hire you to work with you."
"Almost every person experience being a student once a while in our lives, we have different stories/experiences while we are studying. Some students have crucial times while studying and at the same time dealing with family problems. Usually students are being bothered by these family matters and sometimes even if they are at school they keep on thinking of it. Family problem affects the students gradually, it affects their focus on studying when they keep thinking of it, and sometimes a part of their behavior also changes. (Ferrer, Dollentas, & Reyes, 2012) When a child misbehaves or fails to meet expectations at school, the child\u2019s home and family life is usually considered."
"This may be due to Barbantio not accepting their eloped marriage because of Othello being a black man. The contemporary audience would immediately view this relationship as an illicit love affair due to Othello\u2019s exotic character which would be very rare to come across in the Elizabethan era. Brabantio uses manipulation skilfully disguised as advice in an attempt to separate them.in act scene 1 scene three he states \u2018look to her moor, if thou hast eyes to see; she has deceived her father and may thee."
"Capulet has found Juliet the perfect husband, a gentleman of a noble family, \u2018Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly lien\u2019d.\u2019 He wonders what could Juliet want more than what he has provided with her. It drives Capulet crazy \u2018to have a wretched puling fool, a whining mammet, in her fortunes tender,\u2019 who is ungrateful as she is. As Capulet sees it, Juliet is \u2018in her fortune\u2019s tender\u2019 because good fortune is offering everything to her. For her to refuse the good fortune because she is too young is (ironically enough) just childish."
"Countless of Australians and migrants were not accustomed to the lifestyles of each other and often wrongly misinterpreted each other\u2019s actions. In the text, the author Tim Winton uses a hyperbole within the line, \u201cTheir neighbours were not murdering each other, merely talking\u201d. He uses it to demonstrate how the new couple were not use to people casually talking to each other in that loud manner which had been influenced by the European culture of the neighbours. Australians and migrants wrongly misinterpreted each other\u2019s actions which lead to one believing the other was crazy and vice versa. This exemplifies the different cultures each one lived by and the traditions that went along with them. The Australians were quiet and friendly people who are always respectful and knew their boundaries. Whereas the migrants were loud and critical people who always had an opinion and did not know what boundaries were. This is conveyed in the story when the new couple planted vegetables in their backyard which caught the attention of their neighbours, who were quick to give them advice on how to plant and maintain the vegetables."
"\u2018Mother can do everything but can not replace it.\u2019 She is the most important and important element in our lives. The moment when the girl realizes the growth life, change of the world, attitude change. She learns to love and accept the world from a broader perspective. Her love is as deep as the sea and she flies high into the sky. I always felt through her eyes that she could read our minds. Our worries are not hidden from her, and without her we are nothing."
"Virgin Atlantic has been working alongside NASA to develop a new method of landing their aircraft quickly and efficiently. The term it has been given is \u2018Continuous Descent Approach\u2019. At present the current landing procedure involves a series of level offs which disrupt an aircrafts descent and burns unnecessary fuel. This new approach involves an aircraft beginning its descent far earlier in its flight plan and at a more efficient speed to reduce the amount of fuel it uses when coming into land. \u201cThe goal of the Continuous Descent Approach is to allow aircraft to descend in a manner that is fuel efficient and environmentally friendly,\u201d says Rich Coppenbarger, lead investigator for the Oceanic Tailored Arrivals Initiative at NASA. This change to an aircrafts landing procedure would save about 200 kilograms of fuel on each landing alone, according to research conducted by NASA (2005)."
"The female\u2019s body shape will also begin to change. There may be not only an increase in height and weight, but the hips may get wider. There may also be an increase in fat in the buttocks, legs, and stomach. Adolescent girls will also experience menstruation, or menstrual periods. Social and emotional development They may start to complain that parents prevent him or her from doing things independently. They start to have greater concerns about others and has thoughts about their purpose in life. Until now, a child\u2019s life has revolved mainly around the family."
"Antony was a devoted fan of Julius Caesar. Because he was a buddy, he wanted to be 2nd hand to Caesar, the brand-new king. Whilst Caesar would become the king, the most important however least powerful piece in chess, he would end up being the rook, a semi-valuable, really important piece."
"Together we taught each other how to be patient and that we could not always have things we wanted when we wanted it. I also learnt that life is sometimes just not fair and that her sitting in the front seat for two days in a row was just tough luck. And that I needed to think faster and smarter. Teacher relationships like these help provide children with their first peer interactions and the first opportunity to handle the different aspects of long-term and intimate relationships."
"Everyone who is working in schools must be aware of ways that children can experience prejudice and discrimination. Prejudice can occur through lack of knowledge and understanding of diversity. Prejudice is making assumptions about children or young people because they belong to a particular group. For example, a child who has a disability may be assumed to have learning difficulties. When people demonstrate prejudice, they often label children. A label may be given to an individual or group. It happens when a particular characteristic or label is given because of prejudices."
"In conclusion, throughout the novel, themes of identity, hopes and dreams, and wealth inequality are brought up and represented in numerous ways. From his medical history to lacking self-confidence, Junior deals with some obstacles throughout his life. But in the end all he really wants is a good future for himself whether that is becoming an artist or just simply playing basketball. Wealth in Junior\u2019s life is seen as a burden but doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t continue his education and make the best of himself by seeing the brighter picture of events while facing the rough side of consequences."
"First reason the death penalty should be abolished is because the risk of punishing somebody innocent. \u201cWe\u2019re only \u00adhuman, we all make mistakes,\u201d is a commonly used phrase, but it is tried and true. Humans, as a species, are famous for their mistakes. However, in the case of the death penalty, error becomes too dangerous a risk. The innocent lives that have been taken with the approval of our own government should be enough to abolish capital punishment."
"The founder does not have any interested to sell their family business, because the owner dreams to remain the business in their family. However, in order to expand their business, shareholder may be required to gain some capital, but the family will still holding the majority share compare to other shareholders. The company is implementing a basic compensation method which is base salary and allowances."
"* Estaquio Salvador is the Major/Central Character in the Novel, Po-on by F. Sionil Jose. He was the one who resolves the conflict between Ba-ac and the Spanish Officials by leaving Po-on and gives information to his family and relatives of what he have learned during his stay in the convent and his journey with Padre Jose."
"Throughout the ages, particularly the feudal age, gender has been considered to shape the behavioural patterns of the sexes. Women and men were expected to display similar characteristics no matter what part of the world they came from. However various people have proved such expectations wrong. Ann Oakley (1972) firmly believed that the culture of a society is what determines the type of behaviour displayed by the sexes. I believe that that assumption is right. If one compared the behaviour of a woman in India to\u00a0that of a woman living in North America one would certainly notice a huge difference in behaviour. The constant demand of liberty for all helps to form female\u2019s identity in North America. They demand and get freedom of speech; movement and can occupy any job in society."
"Throughout my life, I realized that I can do anything, if I stay committed and determined on something. No matter how many obstacles that stand in my way, I can go through all of them, with the help of others. There are many creative ways to go through them peacefully. We have the power to change our own destiny, as long as it does not affect the gods."
"They try to maintain this idyllic separation from society and its problems, but as the raft makes its way southward, unsavory influences from onshore repeatedly invade the world of the raft. In a sense, Twain\u2019s portrayal of life on the raft and the river is a romantic one, but tempered by the realistic knowledge that the evils and problems of the world are inescapable. Through different events, Huck ends up at the Phelps\u2019s\u2019 house. Although the reason Huck goes to the Phelps\u2019s\u2019 house in the first place is to find Jim, he still finds a sense of home there."
"Over time, the United States Immigration system has undergone a myriad of comprehensive reforms which have proven to greatly impact the composition of its population. Though it is unclear whether these specific policies were products of theoretical assumptions, such as those associated with a country\u2019s economic stature, the social norms of the time period, or further contributory factors such as the existing political landscape, the issue of immigration has continued to remain problematic in the 21st century and requires a structured approach."
"The radio disc jockey as portrayed by Samuel Jackson, was one of the more important characters in the film as he gave some significant details and narration to create the film\u2019s setting like the rising temperatures at the beginning, and an advice at film\u2019s end for his listeners to \u201cChill\u201d since the heatwave was not about to peter out. The film\u2019s director, Spike Lee, who also plays the role of Mookie, was able to infuse a lot of substantial and rousing factors in the film denoting his pro-black stance."
"Life for many of us is full of hardships. Many times we are faced with difficulties in our families, health, and other issues in life. I\u2019ve learned as I was growing up that I can either overcome the difficulties in life, or it will overcome me. The Lord said in Isiah 43:2, \u201cWhen you pass through deep waters, I will be with you\u201d. This passage reminds me that whatever I go through in life, as long as I have strong faith in God, He will not abandon me."
"WhiteOfficers were involved in 93% of the assaults. In the survey of major national andRegional newspaper between January 1990 and May 1993, the study found reports of130 incidents of police brutality against minorities. Feagin and Lersch found thatblacks and latinos were more than likely to be victims of police brutality if they weredisrespectful in their demeanor towards the officers than if they had posed a deadlythreat. The study also showed that white officers are rarely penalized when theyassault minorities(qtd. in Jet 15). With such statics, we can see that we have a problem in this country. The most recent police brutality case happen early this year, in Southern California, involving latinos in a high speed chase with the sheriffs deputies. Excessive assault wasn\u2019t necessary."
"My philosophy in guiding a young child\u2019s positive behavior is to be a friendly positive influence, giving them lots of love and understanding. I believe that positive reinforcement leads to better behavior in a child; they desire to please the care-giver who makes them feel wanted and valued. My mother guided me this way as a child, and I have used it in my work with children with great success. In several cases where a child, in my care, has repeated challenging behavior, I learned to ignore that behavior, but give attention for good behavior; these children respond to the positive reinforcement and become my helper and learn to improve their social skills."
"A stronger view of racism would be the numerous factions that had been created over the course of time. One of the most infamous ones would be Nazism in Europe. Nazism belief was that among the white race and the Aryans, they form the elite \u201cmaster race\u201d destined to rule and enslave inferior races like the Slavs. But in order to fulfill their destiny, the Germans must first shake off foreign political and cultural ideas and purge themselves of \u201cinferior blood.\u201d The rise of Nazism in Germany resulted in\u00a0the killing of millions of Jews and other \u201cnon-Aryans\u201d in the Holocaust. It was one of the greatest crimes against humanity recorded in history. Another faction would be the Klu Klux Klan."
"Under Pretense-symbolic 30-36 months suited Noah as he did display some imitation with the binoculars and saying \u201cNice to meet you\u201d. Under Dramatization, this was observed in the sand pit where he made ice cream for his friend and asking what colour she wanted. This would be consistent with what research suggests where boys of preschool age engage in more concrete pretend play and girls engage more in abstract pretend play (Li, Hestenes, & Wang, 2014)."
"There are two main points of view on this debate; one from Edward Shorter and the other from Louise Tilly, Joan Scott, and Miriam Cohen. Historian Edward Shorter states that the industrial revolution created many opportunities for women to work which he says led to a rise in the illegitimacy rate. He connects this to the sexual emancipation, or sexual freedom, of unmarried, working-class women. Historians Louise A."
"Romeo and Juliet have a relationship between them, loving relationship. But they both are not the same tribe one is a Montague and one is a Capulet, the two do not match as they have a rivalry between them for decades. They saw each other at first sight at a Capulet party. After the party Juliet went to the nurse to ask her who he is and the nurse said \u201chis name is Montague\u201d and she really did not because she loved him."
"Today, many children live in single-parent homes more than ever before as rising at an alarming rate. And nearly one-half of the children born in this country are expected to spend some time in a single-parent family before reaching age 18(Odu & Ayodele, 2007). The living and parenting arrangements of single parents are as diverse. It is generally assumed that single-parent families have dire consequences for the children raised in them, consequences that extended throughout their lives. Many researchers look at the consequences of children living in single-parent households."
"The child will began to feel empty and engaging in criminal offenses will be there only escape. In the world that will live in teenagers turn to criminal activities rather than asking for guidance or help. Everything starts at home if a child is not learning the rules and regulations at home then the real world is going to be a major setback."
"The Need to Live \u2013 The Need to Ban Guns Last year, about 50,000 Americans died from gun-inflicted injuries. Guns are, non-arguably, designed to kill. Carrying of guns has been a major topic of discussion and argument over the past several years and it has gotten no where close to a solution. Guns should be banned."
"They concluded that commitment is a central relationship-specific motive that promotes a wide range of prorelationship behaviors and enhances dyadic adjustment. Strong commitment to a marriage promotes greater willingness to accommodate. Accommodation is defined as behavior in which individuals forgo self-interested behavior for the good of a relationship, place greater value on prorelationship behavior, and recognize the interdependence of the partners. It is one of several specific mechanisms through which committed individuals sustain their relationships."
"And even though all she wanted was the attention Curley didn\u2019t give her, the men in the ranch knew that talking to her would only lead to trouble. \u201cWell, I aint giving you no trouble. Think I don\u2019t like to talk to somebody ever\u2019 once in a while? Think I like to stick around the house alla time?'\u201d Curley\u2019s wife had all the spare time in the world, and spends it making herself look as good as she can (Appendix B) and flaunts her body to anyone who will look. She desperately seeks attention and acknowledgment that she\u2019s still got the looks that attracted all sorts of men to her before."
"Lastly, there was homesickness. Often when people move to new countries they feel nostalgic. They long for the countries they left behind. They remain attached to their memories and neighbourhoods they grew up in. They remember all the small details from their old life which makes it difficult for them to enjoy the things around them. However, there are multiple ways to cope with homesickness. I made myself overexposed to the areas that made me happy for example; I made new friends that share similar hobbies and backgrounds like me. I tried some local while still indulging in food from back home and I decorated my house with my own culture which made me feel like I still have a piece of my own culture with me."
"Overall, the purpose of this scene is to show that Dumbo has ended up in the black neighborhood and faces complete humiliation by a minority group. Much can be said about these racial issues, but most importantly, there is a question of how viewers of the film understand the relationship between Dumbo with his conscience-like character versus the stereotypical 1940s negro-like crow characters. My answer to this question would be found in a different view of language\u2014the language of music. If music can be compared to the language of a subculture or a dialect of minority group, then it is easy to see that Walt Disney, the writing staff and the musical directors of Dumbo wanted to portray this in the film."
"In conclusion, what I have learnt is about what is community service and corporate service responsibility. What is different between community service and corporate service? Besides, I learn about awareness on social responsibility and care for society. Each person in this earth has their own responsibility to the society. We can define what type that we should alert to help the society. As we know they have five categories that we have learnt. First orphanage, urban poor, orang asli, wellness, and environment."
"It is of import to indicate out that selective socialization is greatly hindered by a society which has strong anti-immigrant or pro-assimilationist sentiments. Anti-immigrant attitudes are likely to trip favoritism and racism, which non merely affects self-esteem, but besides promote reactive ethnicities. Reactive ethnicities form when a group or single signifiers an individuality in resistance to the mainstream civilization. Pro-assimilationist political orientations and policies are besides destructive because they encourage immigrants to cast their ain backgrounds, civilizations and linguistic communications, which foremost and foremost could do immigrants to abandon the cultural capital that they held from their place state, but besides it causes intergenerational struggle and a lessening in both kids and parental self-pride, all increasing the opportunities of downward mobility and marginalization, instead than existent assimilation ( Portes and Rumbaut pg 270- 273 ) . Converse to what hinders selective socialization, there are besides factors that enable it. Selective socialization flexible joints on supportive co-ethnic web. Cultural communities vary in their strengths and effectiveness across different immigrant groups, but they by and large provide societal capital which in bend can increase economic chances for members of a group, enforcement the norms of the place civilization, which in bend maintains parental authorization and it provides a protection from favoritism ( Portes and Rumbaut, 64, Zhou 2006 ) ."
"Taking everything into account, the perspective towards the Latino community is an issue that law enforcement seems to struggle with. An interesting study conducted by Theodore and Habans (2016) stated that if legal or illegal immigrants continue to refrain from interactions with higher authority, this can have a negative implication in future generations with their encounters. Immigration in the United States from Latinos will continue to be an ongoing reason as to why they are a target for racial profiling. Law enforcers must find solutions to prevent racial profiling with minorities and engage in some change to their protocol in training that includes a gain of knowledge in the communities they are serving, without indicting Latinos and other minority groups of crime, stereotypes, and feeding them fear."
"Families are important educational agents with a large influence on children\u2019s development and school evolution. CITATION Mar17 l 1033 (Marin & Boco?, 2017). Furthermore, the Romanian Primary Education have identified six types of family involvement: parenting, communicating, volunteering, learning at home, decision making, and collaborating with the community, emphasizing that each type of involvement can be enhanced by different partnership practices. CITATION Mar17 l 1033 (Marin & Boco?, 2017)"
"The novelist documents the Mira\u2019s pathetic status \u201cHe forced himself on her inspite of it; it is out of that Kishore was born\u201d (1). The predicament of women is not only psychological by societal. Society fails to give a keeping hand to document women problem and close the issue in different format. The agonies of women are partly due to the hybridization of culture."
"The three stories are also very noteworthy because they focus on the role of women in society. Women have always been viewed as the weaker sex, but as the three short stories prove, women are far more resilient than many male chauvinists would give credit for. In fact, the role of women has evolved over the past few centuries and gender roles have evolved quite dramatically over the past few years. Whereas the female characters in the three short stories are confined by the limitations of their gender, the modern woman now faces a myriad of opportunities waiting for her."
"According to an article in the September 1918 issue of the Current Opinion: \u201cOne touch of [j]azz makes savages of us all\u201d (Anderson 138). The goal of white critics was to undermine black music and culture. Hate towards jazz and jazz musicians in general came to such extremes as to where they were threatened through magazine articles. These articles suggested lynching, kidnappings, and murders, among others, to scare the black population. Even though that by the 1920s and early 1930s jazz had gained an international reputation and was already part of the American culture, the \u201cracial innuendoes in articles on jazz continued\u201d (Anderson 141). The white population continuously tried to limit jazz\u2019s growth, by letting the jazz musicians know that their music was not welcome through critical and controversial magazine and newspaper articles."
"In any one relationship, the external beauty influences only 90 seconds, the existence of relationship rest with their noble behaviors and beautifulness of mind. So we need not worry about the external appearance and try to improve your internal thoughts and behaviors. What is Family? The word family has different meaning. One of the acronyms of family is formed like the following. Father And Mother I Love You. As per this acronym, Family means, \u201cfather and mother always express their love with each other. It may also mean that, child say \u201cI Love my parents\u201d."
"Prior to the Brown case, in 1940 another sizeable case arose in Topeka. It is known as the Graham case. The Graham case came in response to Kansas legislators attempt to implement segregation into all schools across the state. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) involved itself in the case but, it was tough. The association experienced an interesting division. One side advocated for African American teachers, administrators, and their jobs. This side closely aligned with the white community but for different reasons. The NAACP was concerned with keeping jobs for African Americans while the white community was concerned with keeping the racial status quo. The other side was anxious to disband segregation. This group involved not only African Americans but also white community members. Even though the NAACP was sharply divided, there was unification in the community on each side of the issue between both races. \u201cThe 1940 Graham case was the last time the NAACP had involved itself in school desegregation, it almost self-destructed.\u201d The tensions found prior to Brown created a division within one of the strongest civil rights advocate groups in the United States."
"Here are just some facts: Eating an average-sized steak for dinner contributes 330 grams of carbon which has a comparable carbon footprint to driving about three miles in a standard gas-powered car. By contrast, an equal serving of chicken produces 51 grams of carbon, while fish produces 40 grams and vegetables produces 14 grams of carbon."
"These seem to be the counterparts of the present saints, to whom Filipinos offer prayers and food, much like their ancestors did. (Philippine History, asiarecipe. com) Their likenesses of their religion are much likely far from each other. As we observe, Spanish religion is purely an influence from Roman civilization and Filipino religion is a culture that blooms naturally as their civilization grows. The Spanish believes in one God hence, Filipinos were animists. That is why, when the colonization took over, majority of the Filipinos rejected their own religion. Moreover, considering some factors that give difficulties to penetrate the areas, colonizer almost failed their mission."
"Total Average density= (0.759 + 0.762 + 0.757)/ 3 = 0.759g/ml Using the table to find out my unknown solution (j41) I noticed that my density was closer to 2-propanol (isopropyl alcohol) than any other liquid on the table but my boiling point was closer to 1propanol than any other liquid on the table. But to go with one liquid I will say my unknown was 2-propanol (isopropyl alcohol) because it was closer to the density I calculated for my unknown and I know my density experiment went very smoothly I trust my density more than my boiling point."
"French mathematician, Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier noticed that temperature of Earth was slowly increasing. He termed it Greenhouse effect. In 1850, an instrument became available to record the surface temperature of Earth. 1880s, Scientists associated the relation between human activities and rise of CO2 level in the atmosphere (Chatterjee & Bhattacharya, 2016). The theory of global warming was developed by Swedish chemist Arrhenius around 1895. He calculated that a doubling of CO2 ppm would be conducive to a 5-degree increase in global average temperature, which is not too far off the worst case scenario for the 21st century."
"Finally, protect water quality and save money also can be one of the advantages in housekeeping operations turning eco-friendly, which means that the less water you use, the less you have to pay for. This is because less water consumption can lowers energy costs from reduced treating, pumping, and heating requirements. Therefore, Gayana Eco Resort has implemented a smart use of water program. For instance, they have their own water reservoir which can collect rain water and water supply tanks to ensure the constant supply of water. In particular, collected rainwater can be used for irrigation ditch, vehicle washing, and flushing toilets as well as other indoor activities which for non-drinking water uses. In this perspective, Gayana Eco Resort has recently installed a water treatment water plant so they can recycle their water into \u201cGrey Water\u201d for the purposes of toilet flushing and watering plants."
"Many women also sought to-awareness awareness and money to attempt to improve soldier hygiene and health. In conclusion, the civil war gave women a place in society never experience before. In male-dominated fields, such as nursing, women fought for a chance to serve on the frontlines. Overall, the civil war was a revolutionary time for women and affected them in various ways."
"We must also talk about the ancestral influence. If parents cut corners, their children will too. If parents spend all their money on themselves and tithe no portion of it for charities, colleges, churches, synagogues and civic causes, their children won\u2019t either. The same way, if parents snicker at racial and gender jokes, a new generation will pass on the poison adults still have not had the courage to snuff out."
"Several categorical apps are discussed as potentials in effectively meeting Jonah\u2019s IEP objectives and are summarized in Table 1 (Stone-MacDonald, 2015, p. 4). For instance, reading-focused apps that read books aloud and provide opportunities for students to interact, prove helpful in satisfying Jonah\u2019s goal of retelling a story. By using this type of app, a story is read to Jonah as many times as needed with the added bonus of highlighting words during the read aloud. Literacy skill-building apps, which focus on skills like building vocabulary, spelling, sight-words, and letter sounds, are more flashcard based. Although, they do have interactive capabilities and animations features making the apps more engaging to young children like Jonah. Reading and writing apps allow Jonah to create stories and participate with his peers during classroom activities. These apps help him with comprehension, vocabulary, phonics and phonemic awareness. Communication-focus apps, the last category investigated by the author, are the most expensive yet the most customizable, and support Jonah\u2019s communication and literacy development"
"Cyberbullying causes a lot of teens to become depressed, increase anxiety and have frequent suicidal thoughts. When teens are on social media they tend to show the highpoint of their lives. When one sees that highpoint, one can start comparing oneself to another. Comparing yourself to another person can make you feel depress and may lead to suicide because you feel like you\u2019re not good enough. On social media, you can make new friends just by a click away but having too much friends on social media can invade your privacy. The more friends you have the more people can screenshot information on you and spread rumors."
"No one is safe from the harsh effects of global warming. But if there is one species which suffers the most, they are the polar bears who can only survive under extremely cold climate. Although their actual population is hard to determine, they are believed to be around 20,000 to 25, 000 found throughout the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas (World Wildlife Organization). Polar bears\u2019 habitat is almost covered by sea ice all year round (Great Bear Organization). The area is said to have a fragile ecosystem, requiring longer time to change and to recover when disrupted or damaged."
"The Kamasutra then goes on to lay down rules of relationships. In accordance with the laws of Dharma it states that the ideal marriage would be to a virgin of one\u2019s own class simply as a means to producing sons. It is interesting that we can see the tradition of females holding less weight of importance in ancient India from a feminist point of view. In the treatise of Dharma it actually states the couple must have sex during a period of eight days at the end of each menstruation, this is another example of all spontaneity being stolen from the lovers. By looking at the Arthasastra it is clear that in practice a marriage might be annulled even though sacred law rules out divorce as an option completely. Polygamy, however, is accepted and Vatsyanna, who wrote the most famous version of the Kamasutra between the 1st and 4th centuries CE, makes reasons for taking on another wife in a list typical to Indian culture which even goes so far as to instruct elder wives on how they should treat the newer wives. It is here that we then see a suspension in their morality by suggesting it is not permissible to have sex with someone of a higher class, here we see the theme of impurity again, and any woman of experience. However, it is acceptable to intercourse with lower classes, prostitutes and widows. In accordance with a long history of lists it describes who one cannot have sex with; a framework very similar to that of the way Dharma classifies with whom each class is allowed to interact with."
"My memory still takes me back to that day, when I carried my little sister on my back for an hour to the nearest clinic with my mother, in search of a treatment for a health condition that we had no knowledge of. It was the longest hour of my life. We eventually discovered that my sister was suffering from pneumonia and was quickly provided medication by Dr."
"In the end, a few lessons have been learnt from Mill; the notion of the universal happiness; the possibility of harmony of interests; and then necessity of policies for the success of his scheme. The same flow of arguments run in Mill\u2019s speech in 1868 in favor of capital punishment. To him, the punishment by death is most desirable for a person who committed heinous crimes such as murder unless there is a probability that the action was undertaken due to factors outside of the character of the individual."
"The formation of jazz occurred between the years 1897 and 1917. When jazz bands started playing, they had no way of recording their music until 1917; and even then, the quality of these recordings were atrocious. Another aspect of early jazz was that anything that was played was ever written. Jazz evolved from the blues, ragtime, brass band music, and other musical works that were all around the United States."
"We can look to other states that have legalized campus carry for more insight. The John-Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research concluded that most research is at odds with the claims that allowing civilians to bring guns onto campuses makes them safer. They point out that in states with the laxest standards for gun ownership, 60% of incarcerated offenders of gun crimes were legal gun owners. They also found that \u201c1) right-to-carry laws do not decrease mass shootings or the average number of people shot in those incidents; 2) the overwhelming majority of fatal mass shootings occur in places where guns are allowed; and 3) when rampage shootings do occur, very rarely are they stopped by gun-wielding civilians.\u201d They also point to the trend that mass shootings are increasing in frequency in the same time frame that restrictions are being lifted on public carry. They further point out that public carry on campuses is especially problematic as the student body makes up most of the population. College-age people tend to take more risks, abuse more alcohol, attempt suicide more often and are more likely to engage in violent behavior."
"Each argument contains strengths and weaknesses, and the point of this paper is to show you that Marquis presents a more sound argument against abortion than Thomson presents for it. An in depth overview of both arguments will be presented in the paper, as well as a critique of both the pros and cons that stem out from the question-begging arguments."
"Associates are encouraged to gain experience across disciplines to fully understand the hotel business, explore their career options and ultimately, become adept at handling an increasingly broad range of responsibilities and challenges (Marriott International, 2009). Overall, Marriott associates participate in about 10,000 training classes every year, including e-Learning and self-paced learning options. Marriott is committed to promoting from within whenever possible. More than 3,000 of Marriott\u2019s managers began their careers at Marriott in entry-level positions."
"First they require the information about the difference between right and wrong. To attain that, the teacher has to set ground rules which the child is not allowed to break. The second component the child requires to find his/her inner discipline, is a prepared environment. The child needs to be able to explore and experiment within this environment. The environment should be maintained by the teacher. The third is to move freely within this environment to perfect their co-ordination skills. Control of movement is engrossed with the development of discipline."
"This was primarily proposed by John Bowlby in 1951 who believed that if a child was deprived of the opportunity to form an attachment during the early years of life then social, emotional and/or intellectual problems would develop later in life. Bowlby also suggested that it could lead to conditions such as depression, bed-wetting and even dwarfism. (Birch, A. 1997). Rutter, M (1972, 1981) supported Bowlby\u2019s position that disruption of early child care could have adverse effects on psychological development. However he disagreed and contested Bowlby\u2019s concept of maternal deprivation."
"The Singaporean government is playing a vital role in ensuring racial stability in Singapore. By ensuring that racist and insensitive comments are dealt with appropriately, it sends a message to the younger generation that being prejudiced is against the country\u2019s morals and values. Furthermore, policies implemented by the government can help the financially troubled and close the income gap. This is just one of the ways that the government can step in to reduce prejudice from an economics point of view. Lastly, the thinking of the individual plays a very important part in the abolishment of prejudice."
"It all started off when I got hired in the 10th grade and Brittney and I were in History together when I told her. She immediately asked if I could get her hired and I told her I supposed I could help her since she sounded so desperate when she asked. After a few days after I mentioned to my boss that a friend of mine was seeking employment and wanted to join our staff he told me to call her and tell her she was hired. She was thrilled that I had gotten her the job. The both of us were not so thrilled to find\u00a0out what our job was going to be like. Soon after working there for a little over a year Brittney and I realized we didn\u2019t have to slave for minimum wage when many of our friends had clean jobs and were getting paid way more than either of us. So, we decided to throw in the towel and quit. It wasn\u2019t long until Brittney and I landed a job together getting paid way more and staying clean at a shoe and apparel store called The Underground Station. We loved our job. It was just another thing that brought the two of us even closer."
"\u201cToday\u2019s young minds are the makers of tomorrow\u2019s world\u201d They must respond to their insights and be jubilant to their own moral instincts.But \u2018Rebellion\u2019 does not yield fruits and so they should try to \u2018adapt\u2019 all phenomena with \u2018unbroken self-confidence\u2019. They also should frame their own \u2018ideologies\u2019 and get inspired of the \u2019eminent figureheads\u2019 who strove for the cause of a preponderence."
"Brownlow. From the day he was born, no one valued his life and showed compassion to him. It is through Oliver\u2019s emotional suffering that we truly understand the extent of misery endured by orphans of the 19th century. Oliver in his wretched condition is continually pitied throughout the book, and his constant outburst of emotions and pleading makes the readers feel sorry for him. Through the examples and phrases from the book we realize that they the orphans were always victims of harsh treatment and foul language as they are always insulted."
"\u201cDesiree\u2019s Baby\u201d, by Kate Chopin, is a short story that deals with love, prejudice and rejection, including some racist traits. The story develops in a period of time characterized by separation of races where whites were rich and superior and blacks were inferior and mostly slaves. Throughout this short story, social status and how human relationships were dominated by power and appearance, become the center of the story. Desiree\u2019s Baby\u201d describes the life of a young woman called Desiree, who was adopted by the Valmonde\u2019s family when she was abandoned in front of their house."
"It is high priced because \u201cthe consequences or error and procedural unfairness are magnified when life is in the balance; thus, courts have imposed astringent due process protections.\u201d (Dellapiana 1) Being in really tough economic times, wasting all that money on the death penalty seems inappropriate. All that money wasted on murdering someone, could might as well be used somewhere else in a productive manner. Dieter believes and states \u201cthe death penalty in the U.S. is an enormously expensive and wasteful program with no clear benefits. All of the studies on the cost of capital punishment conclude it is much more expensive than asystem with life sentences as the maximum penalty.\u201d (Dieter 2). The money accumulated to be used in the death penalty is desperately needed in other important programs. For example, \u201cIn Florida, the courts have lost 10% of their funding, with another cut expected, as home foreclosures accelerated. Philadelphia is leaving 200 police positions unfilled. In New Hampshire, civil and criminal jury trials were halted for a month to save money; in one county, 77 criminal trials were delayed for up to six months.\u201d (Dieter 12)."
"\u201d (page 31) This represents a \u201cdirty thing to tell around\u201d as George says. This shows that their marriage is not happy and Curley sees his wife more as a trophy than as a woman. He is possessive but disinterested in the same time of his wife. He goes in town at \u2018Susy\u2019s place\u2019 on weekend nights and nobody on the ranch criticizes him for spending the nights in a brothel even the couple have been married for only two weeks. The only time when they are in the same room is when Curley\u2019s wife is dead, which is just for a short time as Curley is more interested in searching for Lennie rather than being with his wife."
"On the last day of community service; the students decided it would be a good idea to take the children for an educational trip to USIU-Africa because they were eager to see how university looks like, what the students actually learn and to see the school in general. We took a lap around the school compound; started with the Science center, they saw the laboratory and were amazed by how the classes were big and clean. We then headed to the Student center and they took the time to walk into the gym, they saw the swimming pool and we even visited Mr. Hussein, the Community service coordinator. He was happy to receive the smiling children."
"Day one: I drew a spider. I wanted to see my version of a spider and I was surprised at the outcome. I felt strange to be at the drawing board again so to speak. I felt like an alien trying to communicate with humans for the first time. It was awkward for me to begin and decide what I wanted to do in the first place, and it was like an encounter with ET trying to explain what I had no business doing. I struggled with the arachnid\u2019s body, and I decided to draw it belly up and create a black widow spider. I completely colored it to find that my red sharpie was missing in action. Other than the sharpie faux pas, I actually liked my spider! I also thought it would be cool to put into art one of my fears. I also wanted to incorporate the spider because my dad had an awesome spider tattoo and he has always been someone I can relate to (even if we were butting heads). He sadly passed in 2017."
"This is emphasized in the way how Ruth raised her children, not taking lightly one instance where Billy refused to recite a biblical passage in Easter Sunday (McBride, n. pag. ). However, questions on race is also9 presented in this chapter, with James asking her mother what is the color of God\u2019s spirit, and her mother replying that it has no color, that God is the color of water (McBride, n. pag. ). Such passages reflect how important color is as an issue at that time, for ones\u2019 opportunities and possibilities in life ism not determined by abilities alone, but by color."
"Contradicting the Dunning school\u2019s view, historian Eric Foner categorized the reconstruction era as a success but an \u201cunfinished revolution.\u201d Deepening Foner\u2019s thoughts, Du Bois, in the Black Reconstruction of America argues that \u201cthe corruption was overstressed and that Dunning overlooked many achievements of Reconstruction.\u201d(Du Bois, 1935) William Dunning believed that the war could have been avoided at all costs and viewed reconstruction as a political measure. Many students from the south flocked to Dunning and his views, thus the \u201cDunning School\u201d was born."
"After our argument, my arrest and starting therapy with domestic violence classes me and my husband had many discussions together. Both of us working really hard on learning a better way of communicating in order to prevent any other miscommunication in the feature. I understand that communication is not a one-way street, it\u2019s not one person transferring information and the other person receiving that information. Communication runs in both directions. I understand that my husband also has feelings and needs."
"Domestic violence is a result of someone wanting control over the victim, the culprits goal is to put fear into the heart of the victim. According to Clark Prosecutor, author of What is Domestic Violence, the batterer uses violence and behaviors, including but not limited to, intimidation, threats, psychological abuse, and isolation to coerce to control the person."
"The common link of weaknesses between the Functionalist view and that of the New Right Theorists is that they are both outdated, and relate back to the Golden Age of the Family (Stephens, 1998). Even in the Victorian era, families faced the same problems as we do today, adultery for example, but they were much less publicized, and the reason for this was that it was much more socially unacceptable than it is today (Stephens, 1998)."
"From this time until 1947, when the act was repealed, only 8 people were admitted into Canada. The Chinese Exclusions Act shattered the plans of anyone who wished to bring their family over and also prevented anyone returning to China for a visit to stay more than 2 years without losing the right to return. After the act was passed, the Chinese had to register with the immigration office and were forced to carry their certificate of registration on them at all times or they could be jailed or fined. The act also prevented all Chinese from becoming Canadian citizens. The Chinese were faced with much racial\u00a0discrimination by the Canadian government in the 1920s."
"Life of rational human beings consists of vast variety of different actions that serve as a stairs to achieve happiness, because they desire happiness as an ultimate purpose in itself. Many great and influential thinkers and philosophers stated this point. However, there are difficulties and obstacles which are essential and which have to be overcame in order to achieve happiness. Therefore, happiness as an end goal motivates people to overcome difficulties, which are the essential part of their lives. Eventually, the evil, which at first sight seem to have nothing in common with happiness, indeed serve as a tool to achieve happiness. Thus, every essential components of humans\u2019 lives have an end purpose to achieve happiness."
"The working poor in India live in the same conditions as the non-working poor. Informal jobs: no taxes, no contract, no social security, no retirement pension, no employment security. Some people create their own school within the slum (informal school, because they don\u2019t have a license). And the results are better than the results in a state school. License Raj: during British domination, if people wanted to do something, they had to get a license."
"Corruption has long been recognised as highly devastating in paving way for high mortality rates and it has proven to be the worst contributory factor, the most saddening factor being that most African governments are doing nothing, if at all, to abate the mortalities. An understanding of these effects can help create awareness and can attract changes and meaningful contributions toward health improvements thus reducing the deaths."
"The recent protest characterized by players taking a knee during the national anthem is an example of debatable subjects as far as unity or division in the society is concerned. This paper critically examines the controversy around the National Footbaly League (NFL) with regard to kneeling (and sitting among some players) during the national anthem to unmask the associated unity or division in the society."
"Being a teenager is indeed a very difficult part in the cycle of life. It can ruin your self-esteem and self-confidence in a second. For example, cool kids pick on the insecure ones for the fun of it. These kids laugh at nerdy-looking teens and snicker at try-hard-to-fit-in ones. Usually, the ones being laughed at and looked down upon are the ones having problems with vanity. Their sense of futility plus the kind of attention they get from others decreases their self-esteem to zero, thus, causing their self-confidence to drop. This shouldn\u2019t be the case. The vainer a person is, the more he should do something about it, and the more he has to believe in\u00a0himself."
"The leader must be able to correctly convey information to subordinates, set an example, and control the execution of the tasks assigned. The leader must find the right tools to motivate staff. The correct impact and inspiration of his subordinates, will lead the leader to the goal that he sought to achieve. For this, the leader must constantly strive for self-development and self-control. A true leader has such qualities as: dedication, confidence, sanity, restraint, determination and creativity."
"Dickens uses a metaphor of the weather to contrast the murder, it is an ironic contrast though, as sun brings new life but it can not bring Nancy back to life. \u2018The sun, the bright sun\u2019 shows Bill Sikes truly as a vicious bully.\u00a0Towards the end of the novel both Bill Sikes and Fagin die, while Oliver finds happiness and security.\u00a0The book makes the reader aware of Victorian society, the sheer terror of the workhouse and bullying within that society. Charles Dickens uses a range of techniques to present the bullies within the novel. He uses a wide range of language, sarcasm and irony throughout. Charles Dickens emphasises many types of bullying and throughout his novel highlights episodes of violence and bullying which most of Victorian society accepted."
"According to (LSE, 2005.89-134) lack of stringent and effective identification process has been found to encourage crime in that people are more likely to engage in crime on realization that it is hard to be caught. Identification cards are important in that they enable the government to plan more effectively. Accuracy in census can only be achieved if proper identification measures are put into place. For instance cases of ethnic discrimination have been blamed on poor census processes, which never come up with the actual number of ethnic minorities such as the blacks in a given community."
"This reference is saying that life is God-given and holy. So if you destroy it then you are destroying God\u2019s work. God created two sexes so that child could be produced, so God wants children to be had. The question to be asked though is when does life begin? If a Christian believes it starts at conception then they are very likely to be against abortion at any stage."
"I was sufficiently fortunate to see every one of the three depictions upon their entry from Paris. Some portion of my thesis manages Whistler\u2019s enhancing work, so I made a straight shot to inspect his most celebrated craftsmanship before it went up on the gallery divider. Amplifying glass close by, I was particularly struck by the delicacy of the paint; shut everything down, turns out to be evident that Whistler utilized thin oil paints, intensely weakened with turpentine, to make semi-translucent, watercolor-like tinted washes."
"The character slips is, almost ghostly with her mysterious veil, and is just as dramatic as Lord Illingworth\u2019s built up and extrovert entry. The way she arrives without being announced make sure that the audience pay close attention to her, especially as they know her to be the \u2018woman of no importance\u2019. This section is key to the play as it links together almost all the themes the play is trying to convey. The battle of the sexes is played upon greatly, creating dramatic tension for the audience as they want to know how events will turn out when the men and women reunite."
"But because of the insistence and soundness of the approach that Toys R Us is bent on taking when it comes to their marketing and overall efforts in the Land of the Rising Sun, Japan and its erstwhile unwavering style in toy selling finally yielded to the pressure made by Toys R Us."
"The father or the oldest male relative is given the greatest power. The women, on the other hand, are expected to submit to these men. As for child rearing, grandparents play a vital role in this process in imparting moral values to children, for instance, regarding good marriage practices. Divorce is unacceptable and the petitioners could be treated as outcasts."
"Two infants would really be pushing our financial limits. I was thinking how unfair this was. I had taken every precaution to ensure that I would not get pregnant, but I somehow ended up pregnant. When my husband came home that afternoon I was still crying, and I explained the whole situation to him. My husband was overjoyed at the news of having another child. I was confused by his emotions because I thought he would be feeling overwhelmed as I was. After I told my husband, I also told him that I was planning to get an abortion. He wanted to know the reasoning behind my decision."
"After visiting the Marine Park, the boats dropped us at Berjaya Tioman Island Resort where we had the afternoon free. The resort was big and had all the trimmings of a luxury resort: airstrip, golf course, shops and landscaped gardens. However, I noticed that the waters in front of Berjaya were full of dead coral rubble and there were few fishes here. Probably there is a sign of over-development in this part of Tioman. There was also a sign on the beach warning visitors to beware of jellyfish, although I didn\u2019t see any during my stay here. They were probably seasonal."
"Teachers play an essential role in children\u2019s social, cultural and economic development. They transmit and execute values that develop their creative thinking and interests. In the last decade, women have made a significant advancement in adapting the education sector as their field of career. This is due to the fact that women educators provide nurturing care in their pedagogical practices. Also, because they are biologically engineered by the universe to be better at raising young children. Moreover, women multi-tasking skills make them a strong fit in the educational setting as they do it from an early age at home while doing household works."
"The Sambo was a caricature created to depict the black male as being lazy, child like ignorant and care-free making the black male seem more like a child than a male. Another example of a racist caricature is pickaninnies which are black children. Pickaninnies were depicted as ugly kids with rough wooly hair, big eyes, dark black skin, big mouths and bright red lips. Pickaninnies often resembled animals in children cartoons and were viewed as savage by white people. One of the most popular caricatures of the 1900\u2019s is the mammie caricature."
"\u200bIn conclusion, steps towards achieving my goal in consulting include working hard at getting good grades and graduating with a degree in Business Administration. My odds include a lack of good leadership and communication skills which I am willing to work on through practice and research to gain more experience. Industry standards are the same in the top consulting companies as the job descriptions do not vary at all. The salary is good for an entrance position as I can always make more money later, when I am more experienced, by working as an expert in the field of consulting. The job requires a lot of traveling but I do not mind because as a young person with few responsibilities, I do not mind touring the world and meeting different people. I believe the experience will be an added advantage in my portfolio and working experience. The job demands a lot of training and coaching in the early years but I am focused on facing the challenges and beating my odds."
"Combating identity theft often necessitates that the sufferer identifies the type of crime with which he is dealing. Key among the different types of identity theft is financial identity theft, where the culprit accesses the victim\u2019s bank account and makes financial transactions with the same. In addition, there is insurance identity theft and medical identity theft, which occurs when the offenders obtain unauthorized identity information and use it to access the victim\u2019s insurance, and attain medical treatment without the latter\u2019s knowledge. Criminal identity theft, on the other hand, comes up when individuals commit crimes under other people\u2019s names. In some cases, the perpetrators use fraudulent identity cards with the casualty\u2019s personal details to evade the law. In the case of tax identity theft, the person responsible would provide fake tax refund claims to the IRS with false or stolen personal information including the name and Social Security Number, which results in delays in the capacity of the victim to obtain legitimate tax refunds."
"In John Steinbeck\u2019s novel \u2018Of Mice and Men\u2019 starting now and into the not, all that inaccessible OMM Steinbeck handles various issues looked by people during the 1930s. As the 1930s were severely organized events for most by far it is a perfect setting to reveal the legitimate characters of people."
"Candy sees no hope on the ranch \u201cwhen they can me I wisht somebody\u2019d shoot me\u201d he\u2019d rather be dead than stay on the ranch now his dog has been shot. He desperately wants something to look forward to, something to be happy about, and somewhere to belong to. The idea of this dream gives him hope. He wants to join the dream because his dog has been shot. Lennie and George accept him because he has got the money."
"(1995), directed by Carl Franklin and starring Denzel Washington and Jennifer Beals, is clearly a film noir with all the entertainment appeals of that genre, mystery, murder, and suspense, the film goes beyond that genre appeals and reveals certain contemporary social implication, in particular, that the film is as much about the relations of blacks and whites in the 90\u2019s as in the 40\u2019s, the time in which the film is set; and an understanding of this racial motif, especially as it deals with White police power and corruption over Blacks , the Black image of the American"
"It\u2019s one thing to tell someone that you believe in them. It\u2019s quite another to put your money where your mouth is, and prove to them that you believe they can achieve great things. Inspirational friends have to have the quality\u2019s of being good role-models, kind and caring people, have lots of loyalty, honesty, empathy, are always supportive in what you do or say and that take time to listen to your problems."
"This must have been very hard on Lee. It was shocking to hear that he tried to resign after he lost this battle. I thought it was very interesting that the Confederacy\u2019s need for shoes is was what led them in to Gettysburg. I bet they never thought that the result of this stop would end up in 150,000 men fighting 51,000 men dying in the greatest battle ever fought in the northern hemisphere. The actual pictures, paintings, and simulated video used while describing these battles were really good and the helped me to gain a sense of what it was like to be there. I also enjoyed the irony in the fact that the North entered Gettysburg from the south and the South entered from the north. It was also interesting that the troops fighting over the Little Round Top were both from equal distances from Gettysburg in the opposite directions."
"S\u00e5xual viol\u00e5nc\u00e5 in dating r\u00e5lationships was also prevalent. Studies have shown that rapes that happen in dating relationships among White women are about 57% and 25% of them reported being victims of completed or attempted rape Various types of sexual coercion were reported often by women than men. This included touching, completed rape, pressure to have sex, forced kissing, and attempted rape (Wood & Rennie, 1994). Typically, the perpetrators of these forms of sexual aggressions were mainly men."
"Political Corruption is another evil which inverts the fate of our lives. The only elucidation can be the awakening of today\u2019s modern youth\u2026 The notion of a vibrant and rational youth should be considered from the birth of the individuals\u2026The Family constitutes a \u2018small institution\u2019. It disciplines a human to be a well-mannered and virtuous citizen right from the birth. It orchestrates the amiable pecularities that would sculpture the rationality of oneself. The Family instructs the chilc to amalgamate with the social order and to overcome the discrepancies of the humans.If a lad lacks any of these demands, he\u2019ll lack the \u2018Noble Concepts\u2019 of \u2018Fraternity, Secularity, Selflessness and Love for fellow beings."
"This was very much the case for Tan\u2019s mother, towards the beginning of the piece Tan makes it clear to the audience that while her mother\u2019s English may be \u201climited\u201d this in no way reflects how much English she comprehends. Tan also discusses how, when she was growing up, her mother\u2019s \u201climited\u201d English limited Tan\u2019s perception of her, \u201c\u2026because she expressed them imperfectly her thoughts were imperfect.\u201d was the logic behind Tan\u2019s view of her mother when she was growing up. This was the view most people seemed to have of Tan\u2019s mother, which is an incorrect perception of her mother\u2019s actual intelligence and comprhension of the English language."
"-\u201cfingernails were red\u201d \u00a0symbol of danger, sexuality, blood, passion. Stoplight! She will be cause of danger later in novel. -\u201crolled clusters, like sausages\u201d \u2013> childlike, na\u00efve little girl.

Has sex with prostitutes but calls her a tart??? da fuq +!! Objectification. Ironic cuz what she really wants is human contact not sex. The men don\u2019t even consider that she could have more complexity other than wanted a man physically. -ranch is a patriarchal environment."
"My virtual child is Schneider. I had mixed feelings when I started this project, as I did not know what to expect because I had never tried to raise a child online before, or even considered the possibility of doing it in such a manner. It was strange trying to raise a child through an online simulation, considering real life experience cannot be substituted in such a way. As time passed, however, I began to understand the great significance of learning how to parent in relation to understanding the nuances concerning a child\u2019s development, along with their needs and the different ways in which they respond to their environment."
"I quickly turned around and asked my husband why he would choose such a movie to watch. He looked at me and said it was a highly acclaimed comedy and that it would get better if we gave it some time. I decided to sit down and be open minded and give it a chance. I looked up a few reviews on my phone to see what others had thought of the movie and I was not shocked to see that others felt the movie promoted racism and was inappropriate due to its racist slurs and comments."
"Within our setting we had a child (X) who is two and had very little speech. She had been referred for speech therapy and we were working alongside them to increase her communication skills with activities they guided us with. The keyworker also followed the child\u2019s interest in prams and shopping trollies to help bring on her speech which worked amazingly for her and we\u00a0are now seeing a little girl that is known as \u201cLittle miss chatter box\u201d in her class ! Amazing work all lead through communication between Nursery, Parents and Professionals."
"Alexis de Tocqueville was seen as the first real sociologist to appear in the United States. His studies were based on the American society and cultures. He was the first individual that reflects his studies were based on everything he had seen in society to show state of race relations in the U."
"Play is a subset of recreation. Similar to leisure and Recreation, all of play is recreation, but not the converse. Play is voluntary behavior, bounded by rules, experienced by both human and non-human beings, which stimulates the mind and body, prepares an individual for similar future situations, and allows for personal growth within the individual. The main difference is that play is bounded by rules where recreation is not. Some examples of recreation that are not considered play would be meditation, reading, or watching TV."
"Traditionally, individuals would spend the most amount of time with their parents. In these changing times, however, more and more parents are unable to spend time with their children and teach them the right moral values due to long working hours and school hours. Recently, the State Of The Family Report for 2011 found that the average number of hours that parents spend with their children was 29 hours per week. With less time to spend with their children, how would parents cultivate moral values and in their children?"
"When talking about intercultural communication, immigration come to mind. Analyze this concept and two concerns related to it. Immigration; one of the biggest and more controversial topics in the last years. In reality, this is a problem that in one way or another every country has seen and experienced. In the history of the United States is present, since the first time when Africans were imported to the U.S to perform slave labor. Since then many people state that the United States is a country of immigrants."
"Even though that her owner knows that eating pork is forbidden in Aminata\u2019s religion, her owner still gives her pork to eat without any other choice, making her feel less powerful creating his dominance and power. Aminata being a African woman is entitled to nothing more but to feel powerless and being in the lower class of society while the slave owner in the upper class to be dominate and powerful, \u201cGender contributes significantly to social inequalities. However, the United States is racially organized and hence its class structure is racially designed. White racism, along with class oppression and sexism, pervades the boundaries of the culture\u201d (Wilkinson). thus creating an environment where the white man in the upper class is left with power and to be dominant over the powerless Aminata"
"Symbolic interactionists view abortion in several ways. This can range from the different ways that people would interpret \u2018abortion\u2019 within different cultures to the influence of the \u2018significant others\u2019 in terms of peoples\u2019 development of morals and their own assessment of their \u2018self\u2019 in this situation. As abortion is a never-ending continuous debate, a symbolic interactionist may observe the way people signify abortion. How abortion serves as a situation to them; whether it is personal or simply to achieve rights and freedom. Although abortion functions as a controversial issue in our society, there seems to be no end to whether it will be legal or illegal, and whether women will be able to voice their rights. The three social perspectives: the functionalist perspective, the conflict perspective and the symbolic interactionist perspective all serve as essentials in describing the issue of abortion."
"Majority of recent investigations consistently show a strong correlation between reduced murder rates and executions. The best form of punishment to prevent murder is capital punishment. By apprehending and executing individual criminals, the death penalty extinguishes any probability of the criminal breaking more laws. The death penalty is trying to protect the public from potential murderers. Retribution plays a main part in the idea of capital punishment. The balance of justice is interrupted when someone murders another person. When the murderer is executed, it shows society that no crime goes unpunished, and only then will the balance be restored."
"Substitutes are another type of people you should respect in a classroom environment. You should respect them because they are older than you and have power over you. You should be respectful towards them because they could possibly write a bad report for your class and give it to the teacher. If the teacher gets a bad report about your class then they just might make you do extra work. Remember, substitutes are guests in your classroom and you shouldn\u2019t be rude to guests."
"They expressed the need for state intervention in family life in order to achieve equality for all families. This is known as \u2018Welfarism\u2019. The aim was to use the Welfare State to provide families with equality. This was to be achieved by the state intervening in people\u2019s lives to give a more equal standard of living. Welfarism \u2018is based on the view that impoverishment and disadvantage is not a matter of individual failure but a socially constructed condition characteristic of a stratified society and which needs social intervention to ameliorate it\u2019."
"In many unfortunate cases, the murderers have been given a life sentence without a possibility of parole, and they have managed to live for longer periods than their actual victims actually lived on earth. To make the situation worse, such inmates live a comfortable life in prison, getting three meals per day and an afternoon to practice, while the victim\u2019s family lives a life of anguish. Denis Rader (BTK), born and raised in Wichita, Kansas, was an excellent example of a very notorious serial killer that used to bind, torture and kill his victims without any mercy (Harris, 2012)."
"Thus leading more to the fact that Endo\u2019s novel is less profound than Hick\u2019s film in bringing forth the issues of racism. Although in \u2018Snow Falling on Cedars\u2019 there is evidence of minor themes within the story just like that of \u2018The Sea and Poison\u2019, there is a difference. The Minor themes in Hick\u2019s film do play some part within the issue of racism, whereas in Endo\u2019s novel his minor themes can be linked to broader social issues like social inequality like mentioned before."
"Taylor (134-136) posits that there are new methods such as computer simulation which allows existing information and data to be used by researchers and scientists to further improve on what had earlier been done. Banning animal testing would in this case amount to deteriorating health standards of people within societies. Definitely, animal testing has been a controversial issue considering that there are ethical implications associated with it. While this may be true, the benefits of this procedure however outweigh the drawbacks."

"He creates them so fully that we get their good points, their bad points and their downright ugly points. This makes it very hard to sympathise with any of them. However, there are some characters we can sympathise with in Euripidean literature. As the reader or the audience we can fully sympathise with Alcestis. The play \u2018Alcestis\u2019 is an exploration and detailed analysis of how much of a noble sacrifice the title character made. Alcestis gave her life so that her husband could continue to live."
"Emigrants had a deep influence on the humankind during the 19th and 20th century, at a time when several hundred of thousands of the poor families moved to US, Brazil, New Zealand, Canada and Argentina from Europe. Immigration or Emigration shouldn\u2019t be mystified with the involuntary migration phenomena like the population transfer or the ethnic cleansing . Push factors are the motives that force the people to leave a country of origin whereas the pull factors are the factors that attract people to a certain country."
"She returned to college and attained her Master\u2019s degree, in spite of facing many obstacles. She has always stressed to me that getting a great education is key and important. She is an awesome role model and has been a huge positive influence in my life when it comes to my education. I always go above and beyond to make sure that I do my best in school."
"Since all of the action occurs during Carnival (especially Venetian), the audience naturally expects some kind of confusion and mayhem to occur. This chaotic environment keeps the pace quickened making the carnival setting a natural choice for a swift paced play. Traditionally, carnivals of this kind \u201cwould take place in the various Venetian piazzas and would involve meals of imported delicacies, dancing and entertainment by jugglers, acrobats, etc. as well a feats of strength or daring, performed by young men, and usually resulting in being plunged into the freezing waters of the canal.\u201d(2). With the goings-on throughout the city during Carnival, the play (as the spectators expect) would naturally exhibit the same impulsive atmosphere of gaiety and rapidity of movement that occur during carnivals."
"I should have buried it\u201d (Atwood 112). She also regrets not having buried her baby: \u201cThey scraped it into a bucket and threw it wherever they throw them; it was travelling through the sewers by the time I woke, back to the sea\u201d (168). When a dead body is buried it is generally easier to come to terms with the fact that something has died. Not burying her baby raises her insecurity. There is no place where she can go such as cemetery and grief for the baby, because the foetus is somewhere in \u2018the sea\u2019. It is no surprise that the narrator mixes up the foetus with an animal because \u201cHe [her lover] said it wasn\u2019t a person, only an animal\u201d (Atwood 170)."
"Police brutality is the excessive, unreasonable use of force against citizens, suspects, and offenders. A study showed that most citizens complained against police officers because of the use of profanity and abusive language towards them, the use of commands to move on or get home, stopping and questioning people on the street or searching them and their cars without probable cause, the use of threats to use force if not obeyed, prodding with a nightstick or approaching with a pistol, and actual use of physical force or violence itself for no reason at all."
"In the report Macpherson (1999) recommends more detailed records on stop and search incidents, which requires two copy of records detailing the reason for the search, the findings and action taken, and ethnic identity provided by the person being searched. While one copy is retained by police force, the other copy must be given to the person being searched. The record is simplified to a receipt in 2009 only showing ethnicity of the person being searched and the location, and the full record can now only obtain in person at police station or online (Bennetto 2009, Miller 2010). Bennetto (2009) expressed concern in his report, claiming such change \u201cshift[s] back towards the discredited pre-1995 model\u201d. Such concern is reasonable because it can be seen as tightening of information freedom, which contradicts to what Macpherson hoped to achieve through his suggestion on stop and search records."
"Raj. That encounter with Doctor Raj made me realize that he was not just a \u201cdoctor\u201d but someone special who had the capability of using his knowledge to heal the human body and mind. The competency of a drug, I realized had the power to totally transform a person\u2019s life and I saw this happening in front of me that day with my sister. By witnessing that single event, I felt transformed because that day a seed was planted in my mind, which was a desire to one day become a pharmacist just like him."
"Brown\u2019s essay tries to spotlight the challenge American soccer has in navigating between differing fanbases. On the one hand, participation in the activity is high. But these participators rarely turn into spectators. Most spectators of the activity are from city centers and are typically first or 2d technology immigrants. As a result, he argues that the USMNT has difficulties scheduling video games on American soil in which they won\u2019t face an opposed crowd."
"There is a lot of evidence of the poet wanting to display how propaganda works and what effects it has, as well as to illustrate the ridiculousness of the prejudiced, stereotyped behaviour and way of thinking of National Socialists, especially of those who were discriminating against and persecuting Jews in power in Germany between the First and the Second World War (\u201cThey stabbed us in the back last time."
"Inclusiveness in the diversity of the organization is the only measure to eradicate the issues of differentiation among the employees of the organization over various aspects or the concerns involving the age, gender, sexuality, and caste. This effect on the morale of the employees is adverse and leads to the negative results in the organization. The differences among the employees of the company are a major issue in the company as the productivity of the company and hence the profits and growth of the organization are grossly affected. The leaders of the organization should make continuous efforts for the sustainability of the inclusive culture of the diversity in the company. Enhances the work ability of the employees as the workers are at mental peace and focus on the positive side of the working environment as they strive to work hard and contribute towards the growth and development of the organization. The acceptance of the diverse culture is the key solution to the problem of discrimination in the companies. The communication style of the companies should not be complex and should have easy system to have access to communicate to the upper level management leaders of the organization. The employees should have the right to take action against such issues prevailing in the organization (West, et al, 2018)."
"Although homosexuality causes a lot of people to struggle with their identity, the damage caused by racism due to diverse skin colours is worse. As a result of historical factors, coloured races are often ignorantly considered inferior to Caucasian people, especially those with white skin throughout the world. Examples such as the 2005 Cronulla riots in Australia, a racial conflict involving Middle East Appearance, show that until today, people with coloured skins are still targets of racism due to bigotry and conservatism."
"When taking a look at a chart supplied by the 2000 census (Table 2. 1). It is apparent why Chicano or Latino have actually been acknowledged as a significant player in schools, workforce and communities.

"has been linked to physical and psychological problems, including drug and alcohol abuse, suicide attempts, and suicidal ideation, and other self-destructive behaviors\u201d (Amaro). The abortion procedure appears to be stressful to the adolescent mother resulting in the feelings of guilt, depression, and a sense of isolation. There can also be signs of greater levels of fear and anxiety for the severe pain prior and during the abortion process."
"Although some forms of racism is actually an intentional act of one racial group discriminating against another, there are now more cases of racism in which racism is not involved at all. Many minority racial groups use the term \u201cracism\u201d as a means of an excuse rather than the actual meaning. For example, trapped evacuees in New Orleans, who were mostly black, during Hurricane Katrina, said that \u201cif most of Katrina\u2019s victims were white, relief would\u2019ve arrived sooner\u201d, implying racism was involved. However, the people of New Orleans were given early notice of Hurricane Katrina as well as mandatory evacuation plans. The people who remained chose to stay and were not forced to. They are merely using racism as an excuse for their lack in judgment."
"George was an untrue friend to Lennie was because George was not understanding, respectful, or loyal. First, George never understood Lennie as a true friend would have. Lennie had some mental challenges that he could not control. He needed someone who would understand him. Instead of George understanding that Lennie could not control his mental state, George denied believing he had such difficulties. This put a lot of stress on Lennie because he was always trying to make George happy by trying his best to overcome his mental challenges, but he always failed. On top of all this, Lennie had no one to talk to, which made it even harder to deal with his stress of always trying to please George. To prove that George was not understanding, in the book Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck, George says, \u201c Used to have a h*ll of a lot of fun with \u2018im. Used to play a joke on \u2018im \u2018cause he was too dumb even to know he had a joke played on him. I had fun. Made me seem God da*n smart alongside him.\u201d (p. 40)"
"\u201d \u2018Oliver Twist\u2019 is the story of a boy who passes through many difficulties and troubles through life\u2019s journey each time becoming stronger from it. The novel fictionalizes the experience of the writer \u2018Charles Dickens\u2019 and reflects the social evils existing in the 19th century. In the book \u2018Oliver Twist\u2019 Dickens brings to life the terrible hardships faced by the orphans at that time."
"Women require more frequent contact with someone they consider to be a friend Men are more likely to use humor to taunt a friend while viewing this as innocent fun Women are more likely to refrain from taunting and humor out of fear it may hurt their friend\u2019s feelings Men tend to hang out more in a group, \u2018the more the merrier, \u2018 while women typically prefer to go out with one good friend. Although these differences do not apply to all male-male and female-female friendships, this provides a general idea of how male-male friendships differ from female-female friendships. Regardless of the type of friendship you are in, it is important to identify what you are looking for in a friend. By identifying what you need and want out of a friendship it can assist you with determining if the person you would like to be friends with can provide the type of connection you desire."
"Nina\u2019s character in the light of Indian traditions, we may conclude it calling it a triumph of feminism. But considering the character of Nina in the light of western social and moral conduct we can pass it as a normal conduct nothing to cheer up. The feminist theory is dependent upon certain set of social and cultural traditions."
"How does this affect everyday life? Well, it is bad for business. For example, farmers need people to pick their crops. Who do you think does that? The immigrants do all that work and without them doing that we are not able to buy groceries. You see what I mean, this will affect not only them, but it will affect us."
"Therefore I believe this particular poem within the collection is ambiguous, although it supports the \u2018joke\u2019 it is also heavily ironic, more over Duffy is not re-telling the joke in an obvious way. The poem \u2018Little Red Cap\u2019 however, supports the idea that, having found one jokes Duffy re-tells it throughout the anthology. Little red cap successfully introduces themes that are present throughout most of the collection, sexuality and male inadequacy are expressed within most of the poems, and little red cap is no exception."
"In 1993 Sinatra stepped back into Capitol studios to record his final albums, Duets and Duets II (both of which were highly successful) Sinatra passed away on May 14th 1998. Frank Sinatra was a legendary Hollywood icon, a profound film actor, an iconic musician, and a well known ladies man. There were so many sides to Sinatra, that it\u2019s hard to categorize him under any label. He was always himself, always living to the fullest. He was (like many celebrities) loved and hated, but that never mattered to him. Frank didn\u2019t need anyone to like him. All he wanted was someone to listen and someone to care. That\u2019s exactly what he got. \u201cYou gotta love livin\u2019, baby, \u2019cause dyin\u2019 is a pain in the ass.\u201d -Frank Sinatra"
"If I failed or could not find a new position, what would my family think of me? Failing at a new career would also cause me to lose confidence in myself. These concerns, failure and financial, and not finding a new job made this decision very difficult. The decision to choose a new career was an extremely important one. The sole function of a career is not just to provide a means to make a living; it should have a larger purpose."
"I thought that was a tremendous slap in the face to Richard. Another character that betrayed Thomas More\u00a0after being his friend was the Duke of Norfolk, he foolishly badgered More to relent and join the King\u2019s supporters. Obviously he did not realizing the depth of More\u2019s integrity. Consequently, Norfolk conducted the trial for High Treason against his former friend, never aware that More had eased his passage from trusted friend to state enemy by purposely offending him. Above all, that is why I envy Sir Thomas More because of his individualism, ethics, and courage he had throughout his stand against King Henry VIII. It would have been hard for a person to purposely make an enemy out of a good friend. Even when you know it is for their own good."
"Atlantic Canada, as a region, is being forced to change politically and economically based on the greater success of the economies of the other regions in Canada, predominantly Ontario. Conrad believes that there is some way to keep the cultures and values of Atlantic Canada while at the same time restructuring the political and economic practices of this region.\u201dSubject purely to market forces, historically formed regions are constantly at risk of losing their identity, becoming subject to the logic of global capital.\u201d This quote of Friedmann used in is very important for one of my points about how many regions of Canada are continuously immersed with the threat of losing their culture and ultimately identities. It also causes me to ask the question, will this cause a future increased unity for Canada as a whole or will it continue to separate the unity between Canada\u2019s regions. The region of Central Canada is made up of two provinces, Quebec and Ontario.Quebec\u2019s main industries include such things as forestry, mining (gold, iron ore, gold copper), as well as"
"How if those things that happened on our lives can lead us to our goal, which is happiness? \u201cEverything that happens to me is the best possible thing that can happen to me. \u201d And when we are convinced of the truth that everything that happens is the best thing that can happen, life begins to be much more fun. It is like opening a direct changed to happiness. In other words, Happiness is just waiting, we only need to do what is most necessary, however, it is not just happiness but also the opposite of it, unhappiness is also waiting, and it is depend to us whether we will welcome it or not."
"One day as I rushed home to see mom, she was not in her bed as she usually was. \u201cWhere was she\u201d? I remember asking myself. When dad came home, he said she had gone to the hospital because she had gotten sick again. I felt so sad and went into my room and cried. I could not believe my mom had left me! In my 8-year-old mind, I believed I had been such a bad kid that my mom left me! When I finally came to rely on mom was sick and could not come back to me, I imagined she was locked in a room and would come soon as she was better. This was my belief to help me cope with my mom being gone. Mom was a strong lady, and I just knew she would make herself healthy one day and return."
"However, it is difficult for these immigrant\u2019s offspring to relate to their family\u2019s culture as they may not have had any type of interaction with it. In the short story \u2018Sticks and Stones and Such\u2019 written by Sunil Badami, Sunil failed to understand the meaning of his name due to the lack of understanding to the Indian naming culture, was however conscious of his peers not pronouncing his name correctly, which further led him into obstacles of fitting into his friends\u2019 groups and referring himself as \u2018Neil\u2019."
"When the mother was still alive there was a connection between all siblings to take care of her and to make sure her needs were met. There was also a commitment to make sure Arnie stayed out of trouble and did not hurt himself. They tried to provide Arnie with some kind of normalcy in his life, i.e. throwing him an eighteenth birthday party. External and Internal Family Resources"
"Children will be interested in a certain section of the parent\u2019s magazine elderly men and women of over 60years will be reading the magazine for special purposes. Either to remind themselves of there youthful times, or if they are involved of care of children. People who also are nurturing old people in in-home care or any other place will also be interested in this magazine because the care given to the old people is almost given similar to the children."
"4. As soon as an arrest is made, the police should obtain from the arrested person, the name of a relative or friend whom s/he would like to be informed about the arrest. The relative or friend must then be informed by the police. 5. The police must inform the nearest Legal Aid Committee as soon as an arrest is made and the person is taken to the lock-up."
"In addition, Al Gore includes \u201clittle movies\u201d of his life throughout the documentary. These movies consisted of when he was running for the presidency against George W. Bush, how he became interested in global warming, how his life was growing up, and even life changing moments involving his son and best friend. By including moments of his presidential campaign against Bush it showed his audience how he can bounce back from a loss and sill be determined to inform the people of problems in order to help them. It also shows that if he would have won, he would have made global warming a main issue. \u201cLittle movies\u201d of his young life allow his audience to see ways he actually relates to them. Whether it be the closeness he held with his family or the way he moved from place to place to accommodate his father\u2019s lifestyle as a tobacco farmer and his senate duties. Gore even included the way he has had to deal with a loss of a best friend whom died long before she should have because of lung cancer due to smoking. He included this as a comparison to the situation of global warming."
"In the novel Slim is shown to have a personality which is very unique compared to the other workers on the ranch. Slim is described as having a \u201chatchet face\u201d which is \u201cageless.\u201d This gives the impression that Slim has a sense of immortality around him, which is described as being\u00a0extraordinary. This illustrates how Slim as he is ageless is almost like a piece of furniture for the ranch as he is high up in the hierarchy which further enforces the fact that Slim is a noble ranch worker who is trusted by the men. Steinbeck uses slims \u201cageless\u201d and \u201chatchet face\u201d to employ the use of similes to show the character of Slim. He employs similes when Steinbeck writes that Slim\u2019s hands are \u201cdelicate\u201d and are \u201cthose of a temple dancer.\u201d Steinbeck uses similes to show Slim\u2019s elegance within the novel, which also represents his persona as a character who is able to tell right from right from wrong which is a skill in itself. This is also illustrates how he has great skill with his hands. Furthermore, Slim is a character who is \u201ccapable of killing a fly on the wheeler\u2019s butt with a bull whip without touching the mule.\u201d"
"Abstract People of different cultures, including immigrants of today seem to differ from past generations in that they seek to retain many of their cultural values and are less interested in becoming homogenized within the U. S. culture. This distinctness can create a potentially complex situation for both the client and therapist who may differ substantially in their own cultural values. For successful therapy to take place, it is important for therapists to be culturally sensitive of clients and avoid stereotyping."
"Catholic teachings from 1930 state that \u2018human beings are made in the image of God\u2019 therefore abortion is breaking the commandment \u2018Love the Lord your God\u2019. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that \u201cHuman life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognised as having the rights of a person- among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life.\u201d In the Pope\u2019s new encyclical he says, \u201cthe killing of innocent human creatures, even if carried out to help others, constitutes an absolutely unacceptable act.\u201d The Pope is emphasising that no that no commandment, other than \u2018love your god\u2019, is more important than this."
"If the novel had not been placed during the time era of the Great Depression or on the small island of Alcatraz the reader would not be able to as easily understand and empathize with the conflicts that the characters faced throughout the novel. The way she introduced each character and plot points involving money lead me to the theme of how those who are given power use their resources to abuse that power and make poor and questionable decisions. If money was not the underlying factor for events such as the children working under pipers rule, if Darby would have never had Donny burn down the apartment, and if Jimmy wasn\u2019t fired for accusations of him stealing the money from the store none of these plots could have been possible or tied together. Choldenko set her novel to be during the time of the Great Depression so that she could develop strong characters, a solid theme and a rich amount of history."
"It originates from a mindset that regards \u2018them\u2019 as different from \u2018us\u2019 in ways that are permanent and unbridgeable. \u201d (Fredrickson, 1992, page 9) It should be further considered that Troy had a damaged and shattered relationship with his father \u2013 where all the resentment of slavery produced all the bitterness that Troy grew up with \u2013 their relationship did not nurture in Troy anything positive about human interaction. So Troy tried to make something positive rise above everything that is negative about him."
"The legislation I am going to discuss has been incorporated into my setting by using the essential information in the policies and procedures. The policies and procedures are given to all employees upon recruitment so all staff are aware of the laws and regulations they have to work to. Richardson, R (2011) it is the requirement of the public sector equality duty that equalities is a due regard for schools. Schools are required to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and encourage good\u00a0relations. The equality act is used in the equality and diversity policy in my setting. OFSTED also look for equality in the setting looking for the progress of spiritual, moral, social and cultural development in the development of the children attending the setting. It is also important that the setting do not discriminate against the nine protected characteristics that are outlined in the equality act 2010."
"They will equip them with the skills that they need to reach the senior management position. For ethnicity, Lloyds TSB will provide a leadership programme for ethnic minorities to move into the senior management position. Moreover, Lloyds TSB is also the top employer for Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual (LGB) people in the UK, and their best practice sexual orientation strategy was awarded first place in the 2009 Stonewall Workplace Equality Index. They provide the same entitlements for same sex partner as heterosexual partner (Lloyds TSB)."
"The second type of developmentally informative investigation is the study of sleep. Polysomnographic studies of depressed children and adolescent have tended to demonstrate abnormalities of sleep, including shortened rapid eye movement (REM) latency and reduced slow wave sleep. These generally positive results of polysomnographic studies with children have shown few differences (Rapoport, 2000 p.231)."
"In stanza four, the poet useS the word \u2018together\u2019, which tells me that he was close to his mother. The words \u2018together through the shops and stalls\u2019 suggest to me that his mother helped him through the obstacles of life; I feel that he is associating the shops, stalls and markets in the poem to life\u2019s obstacles. \u2018Free in the oriental streets of thought\u2019 \u2013 this line leads me to believe that the author wants to be free and he needs some space and time to think."
"Roman Catholics would agree that life is God given and holy, and therefore it must not be destroyed. They believe that God created the two sexes to reproduce, and they believe that all sexual intercourse should occur within a marriage for procreation, so there shouldn\u2019t be any unwanted children. As they believe that life begins at conception, abortion at any stage is destroying Gods work and therefore wrong."
"An individual\u2019s motivational reason for wanting to become a police officer does not really differ from person to person. According to a survey given to male and female officers asking what drove them towards a career in law enforcement, they all had similar responses. The majority of the answers these officers gave were the ability to help people, fight crime, have and exciting job, and job security. Contrary to belief, officers have little or no interest in joining just to cause harm or use excessive force on citizens."
"Recently not a lot of studies have been made on the use of restraint on dementia patients. Most articles are outdated and not applicable anymore. With the mushrooming of nursing care homes and the booming industry of\u00a0nursing facilities, researches should be made on how nurses feel about eradicating or lessening restraint use. The locale of these studies is also not very diverse. More studies should be conducted in various settings and environments. A patient in acute care may have a different set of concerns compared to patients in long term care facilities. A thorough analysis of why patients would need restraints in respect with the different settings they are in would have been beneficial. Like knowledge, cultural beliefs may impact on a person\u2019s decision."
"The US Security exchange Commission (SEC) has come up with a roadmap which will by 2014 require U.S Issuers (Companies registered with SEC) to prepare their financial standards according to IFRS. This has brought forth various reactions around the US corporate world. The National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA) has advised the Security Exchange Commission (SEC) to consider convergence between IFRS and GAAP instead of the roadmap in which it intends to adopt IFRS for use by US companies."
"Many of Steinbecks characters had dreams of their own. Including Candy, who wanted to contribute to George and Lennies dream. He offered to but in a fair amount of money. And claimed he could help out even though he only had one hand. Candy was most likely very lonely on the ranch, and considered he had nothing to loose."
"Sophie Caco, in Breath, Eyes, Memory, quotes her mother, \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between what a person wants and what\u2019s good for them\u201d (72). In Edwidge Danticat\u2019s novel, there is conflict between what Sophie wants and what her mother, Martine, believes is good for her. While Sophie wants to live in the great realm of Providence, her mother has a specific idea of what is good for her daughter\u2014remaining pure until marriage, being the ideal, obedient daughter, and studying to become a doctor."
"The economic consequences of migration for the sending country still look quite unclear, yet we could consider the effects largely positive for the economy undermining few long term issues. The social consequences of migration for the host country are from far the most controversial. Nevertheless these show to be in some cases quite positive. For instance the United Nations Population Divison has suggested that Europe might need \u2018replacement migration\u2019, to cope with the ageing population problem, of between 1 million to 13 million new migrants per year between 2000 and 2050 which shows their importance involving social problems. However migration also reveals to have negative social consequences for the host country, for instance it has in some extent resulted in segregation and the growth of parallel communities, In England, there are appreciable numbers of colored people who entered the country after World War II, although they constitute only 1 per cent of the population, their presence has created an awareness of a color problem. Since they are of varied cultural background (mainly from India, Pakistan, and the West Indies), comparative analysis may show some insight into both the role of race and of cultural differences in the\u00a0exclusion and segregation of minority groups in England."
"The only minor weaknesses in the novel were the friendship between Blacky and Dumby Red. Though is does discus how good of \u2018mates\u2019 they were, it did not go into great detail of the complexities they face because of their inter-racial relationship. The other flaw in the novel was the misleading blurb, the blurb deceives the reader to think that the story line will be revolved around Blacky and Dumby Red facing the community whereas it focus on the much broader community facing the truth about the Aborigines."
"The US was divided in three parts, the South, the West and the Northeast. More of the population living in the United States lived in the North\u00a0(Document E). This was because people could find a better opportunity without high tariffs and with less problems of slavery. Slavery was a big issue during this time. Jefferson wrote to John Randolph in April 22 of 1820: \u201cA geographical line, coinciding with a marked principle, moral and political, once conceived and held upon to the angry passions of men, will never be obliterated; and every new irritation will mark it deeper and deeper\u201d (Document F). In other words, Jefferson admits that the country is separated and being divided by a \u201cgeographical line\u201d. This was due to slavery believes, moral and political issues."
"The aspect of social change had opportunities to erupt during the 1950s; people were so set on their views, and much like Troy very few were willing to believe that there was change. Howard Shapiro analyzed this issue \u201cIt\u2019s set in the late \u201850s in an American rapidly moving for an upheaval that will bring massive social change \u2013 change Troy Maxson either fails to see or cannot understand\u201d (Shapiro) Troy\u2019s reluctance to accept social change puts the future of his family at risk and stops Cory from progressing through life and out of the ghetto."
"When the second child came outside of the classroom, I was careful to speak to him in the same way as the first child, giving him plenty of opportunity to explain his perspective of the incident. I suggested to the child that, while I could see why he may have been annoyed, there may have been better ways to handle it. He appeared to be in agreement and when questioned subtly, he seemed to understand why it was I had brought them both out and how things could have been dealt with differently."
"When discussing politics in the beginning of the dinner, Simic was arguning with his brother, then Uncle Boris says \u201cNone of you two know what the fuck you\u2019re talking about\u201d, then it was back to dinner as usual. I think this loose language describes how close they are as a family because they share exactly what they\u2019re feeling and don\u2019t true to sugar coat it."
"He believed this would be done by returning to the gold standard. It would have a fixed exchange rate of the pre 1914 level $4. 86 to the i??1, this was noted by John Maynard Keynes recognised at the time this would be a 10% over-valuation, his insight was correct and Britain experienced high interest rates and the burden of 10% lower import prices, this hindered the home market further (R. Pope, 1998). Transportation was another area which had an economic boom especially in the area of motor vehicles and aviation."
"Earlier I was angry with Lennie coz he spoke infront of the boss when i told him not to.I had to tell the boss a few lies because he realised that Lennie was dumb and the boss wanted to know if I was hangin\u2019 round with him to take his pay check off him at the end of the month.I told him that me and Lennie were cousins so tha is why we hung round together, good job that ain\u2019t true coz if I was any relation to Lennie i\u2019d kill myself."
"On February 23, 2005 a nine-year old girl in Homosassa, Florida disappeared after attending a Wednesday evening church service. She was missing for almost 3 weeks before police found her body in a trash bag, holding a purple stuffed dolphin, in a grave no more than 3 feet deep. Publicly released autopsy reports said that the little girl, Jessica Lunsford, who dreamed of being a fashion designer and Olympic swimmer, had managed to tear two fingers through the garbage bag before suffocating to death."
"Likewise, another participant discussed how teaching children to protect themselves from predators is fundamental. She went on to ask the question, \u2018how do you go to school and learn to become a successful adult and have good decision-making if you are carrying this around?\u2019 Another interview revealed, that at every turn around every corner, there is someone who is looking to take advantage of that child, and that child needs to understand how to protect him- or herself. This participant went on to describe the importance of equipping children with the language they need to express what is happening to them. One participant discussed how many parents do not know how to educate their children or how to appropriately respond if a child discloses sexual abuse."
"Children like to think they are grown up so they will tend to push the boundaries, they maybe talking to you about school or their friends and slip in a naughty word, when you ask \u2018where did you hear that word from\u2019 they will say \u2018i heard it from ( say ) another adult\u2019."
"An alternative interpretation of this poem could be that the reversal of the traditional gender hierarchy created by Duffy could be seen as Mrs Beast losing her feminist traits and manifesting into the feminist viewpoint of a typical dominating male. Mrs Beast undoubtedly takes on masculine characteristics to appear completely dominated in the relationship. Although a feminist critic may argue that she takes on this role to replicate the constant manipulation of women and the societal pressures and constraints, Mrs beast can be seen as manifesting into a dominating figure rather than of an equivalent to her husband which is arguably hypocritical."
"Life is full of hardships, struggle and anxiety which one must face almost daily. This becomes too difficult for people and they create an idealistic way of life which appears easier and better. For example, in Gordimer\u2019s story, the family does not want to face violence from the coloured people. \u201cThere were riots, but these were outside the city, where people of another color were quartered\u201d (Godimer). Due to this, the family creates a safe home with lots of security reinforcements and this keeps the danger out so they do not have to face it. Similarly, Evanescence\u2019s song tells readers about a character who covers up their true personality."
"If the family member faints, resources could be diverted away from resuscitating the patient. There could be accidental exposure to blood and body fluids thus endangering family members to other unknown pathogens. This then leads to a final point, but most valid point, that there is not enough room in an emergency to accommodate the family throughout a code. There may have to be a limit to the amount of family members that may be present in a code due to the small rooms available in healthcare facilities and the amount of equipment needed to save the patient\u2019s life."
"\u201d (U.S. Census Bureau 2015a; Strong, Cohen 10) This remains true, but not for everyone; family can be much more intricate, more so than such an account can explain. Throughout history to this day, the meaning of family has developed and taken many different forms, such as nuclear families, the minutiae of ethnic family groups such as Asian American and European American, and ."
"(Carnes \u2013 Holt, 2012, pg. 419). Child-Parent Relationship therapy is a place where families can meet and work on their relationship with a therapist. Over time this type of therapy can change a family dynamic for the better. Child-Parent Relationship therapy focuses on play and helping parents and children mend and work on their relationship through play. Therapist work with parents to train their responses to their children while they play. This works mostly through relationships, interactions, as well as communication."
"Once I attended a lecture lead by the CEO of one the top well known local private equity fund. He told that he received his education in Columbia business school. Unfortunately, that education wasn\u2019t enough to launch his own business. This man said that our university goals should be in learning more than what university can ever give us."
"Repealing the 2nd Amendment will take away gun rights from all U.S citizens, many Americans assume that all mass shooters have a diagnosed mental illness and therefore we should only take away gun rights from the mentally ill. This is because many Americans cannot cope with the fact that somebody would be capable of inflicting such pain without being mentally insane. In that sense, many believe we just need to make our background checks for buying firearms stronger so those who are mentaly ill don\u2019t have access to them. The book Gun Violence and Mental Illness by, psychiatrists Liza Gold and Robert Simon explores the connection between mass shooters and mental illness. The website The Behavioral Scientist explains their key points and ideas by stating \u201cIn their 2016 edited book Gun Violence and Mental Illness, psychiatrists Liza Gold and Robert Simon summarize the evidence debunking the myth that mental illness is a leading cause of gun violence. As they report, less than 5% of shootings are committed by people with a diagnosable mental illness.\u201d (Rai) Meaning 95% of mass shooters do not have a diagnosed mental illness, contrary to popular belief, they also explain that a mentally ill person is more likely to kill somebody they know or themselves than a stranger. This means that if we were to only take away the right to bear arms from the mentally ill, we would not solve our gun issue because the majority of mass shooters would still have gun rights. If we are unable to generalize about mass shootings and find a specific group to target with gun control, the only viable solution would be to enforce some sort of solution on everybody. A drastic problem like this needs a drastic solution and repealing the Second Amendment would take away all U.S citizens gun rights, and is the solution the United States needs."
"The United Kingdom saw an unexpected infiltration of Kosovan refugees, especially illegal immigrants and asylum seekers during the 1990s. Thousands of refugees were drawn to the Calais Port in France through to the Channel tunnel through the Euro tunnel and eventually to Britain. The renowned Sangatte camp was commandeered by the French Government to deal with the increasing number of Kosovan refugees arriving at Calais."
"While watching Devin compete on America\u2019s Next Top Model, I was inspired by his ability to model. Throughout the span of Cycle 22, Devin became major competition, as he was producing some amazing pictures. The biggest and most scariest part about my brother\u2019s journey to the top, was his makeover. During every cycle of America\u2019s Next Top Model, Tyra sits down and figures out a \u201cnew\u201d look for the models."
"Hundreds of Muslim ghettos are already de facto following sharia, not thr French law. And in twenty years one person out of four in France will be Muslim and almost certainly poor and angry. What are then the future prospects of the multicultural France? Is is really multiculturalism to be blamed for the disastrous situation that has turned out in France? Or are the Muslims responsible for it? Probably not really. The world has already started to discover that beneath the postcard surfaces of the Eiffel Tower and romantic restaurants, the country of arrogance was very sick."
"When people are given different scenarios, circumstances, and asked whether they think a woman should have access to safe, legal abortion, the complexities emerge. According to a national survey by General Social Survey (GSS) on seven specific scenarios, 61.8% said that women could have abortion under some circumstances and not others, 31% said they should have abortion under all circumstances and 7.2% said, the women should not have an abortion under any of the circumstances (Smith and Son, 2012). The circumstances mentioned include a defect in the baby, marital status, woman\u2019s life at risk, socio-economic difficulties and rape."
"This can possibly be a cause for the high rates of unemployment given the fact that immigrants are a source of cheap labour and employees who get the opportunity may prefer to employ illegal immigrants as opposed to locals whose wages and salaries are usually higher than those of the immigrants. Conclusion The idea about introduction of national identity cards is a noble one given the fact that the government has taken all possible measures to make sure that the identification cards will only be used for the benefit of the citizens but not as a source of discriminatory treatment based on ethnicity, color, race, religion or social status."
"not guarantee protection of individual rights. This is all the more apparent where poverty and unemployment is rampant.Whilst xenophobia has been described as something of a global phenomenon, closely associated with the process of globalization, it has been noted that it is particularly prevalent in countries undergoing transition. According to Neocosmos (2006), this is because xenophobia is a problem of post-coloniality, one which is associated with the politics of the dominant groups in the period following independence. This is to do with a feeling of superiority, but is also, perhaps, part of a scapegoating\u2019 process described by Harris (2001), where unfulfilled expectations of a new democracy result in the foreigner coming to embody unemployment, poverty and deprivation."
"Junior is an outsider in both his community and at school. No one seems to notice or pay attention to him except a select few. His relationship with these individuals influences how he sees the world around him. He comes from a family of low social-economic status. His father is an alcoholic, his mother is an ex-drunk, his grandmother was killed by and drunk driver, and his sister was killed in a fire while being drunk (Alexie 2007). He is often bully by the people on the reservation and is rejected by them."
"This book was copyright in 1979, 1989, 2000 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College.\u00a0 White Teacher was previously published by Campbridge: Harvard University Press, 1989. This said book was reprinted with a new preface in the year 2000. Reading and analyzing the essence of this book was required by the instructor for a book report project."
"The sources chosen for the research on racial profiling were found using Google Scholar. In finding proper sources, credibility is critical in finding reliability. The first source is a journal produced by Yale University, a highly respected university. The author, Joscha Legewie has been an assistant professor in the sociology department at Yale, Harvard, and became a professor at Columbia University after obtaining his Ph.D., with years of experience in sociology. Although, bias can be found in is argument in the sense of confirmation. Other statistics have shown that no race is more subject than others to police violence, but this can also be affected by the place the study is conducted. The second source, written by Robert E. Worden is found to be credible due to his Ph.D. in Political science, and his teachings at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. This source was also from a textbook used in college criminal justice classes, and approved by professors amongst these colleges. Bias can be found in his work because of the numerous approaches he took to prove his argument. His sociological theory proved the racial profiling, but psychological could only prove the general brutality, that was not in relation to race. Both of the authors presented their arguments ethically, by analyzing their observations specifically, rather than only confirming their own opinion."
"Community service has helped me to notice other people who have surrounded me and become a true part of society, not just a factual part of it. I found that it\u2019s not difficult to volunteer for community service, and all the lessons I\u2019ve learned will have a significant impact on my future life. The construction of community service requires people to work in groups, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s another big advantage that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. If you work in a group, you connect with others, and this contact will change a lot in your life. First of all, you\u2019ve got a chance to learn from others. Community service does not require any specific training or education to become a member of it. Obviously, not everyone is completely aware of things, and that\u2019s a good chance to learn from someone who is more skilled. I have never been a good cook, but the time spent on the organization\u2019s kitchen definitely taught me a lot. Now I can surely say that I can cook some of the basic recipes I learned that day."
"Two years ago my best friend was a part of these overwhelming statistics. For nearly three years she found herself in a very abusive relationship with her then boyfriend who is now the father of her three-year-old child. The late night calls I received kept me on edge because I just continued to worry when I was going to get that fatal call that my best friend was dead. There were numerous attempts of escape but like most of these women, \u201clove\u201d can sometimes be a curse. Fortunately, my friend was able to break away from her abuser. Unfortunately, turning to the statistics I mentioned above, all are not so lucky."
"In the film Farmingville, immigrants battled to pursue the American Dream. Around the 1990\u2019s about 1,500 illegal immigrants immigrated to Farmingville to seek labor opportunities. They did work such as landscaping and construction. They did the work that the people did not want to do. The majority of the residents from Farmingville were not too happy with them there. In the film, they interview both sides of those who are for or against these laborers. Throughout the film, Margaret Dyber expressed furiously how these immigrants were destroying her community and her home. Most anti\u2019s were angry at the fact that these laborers would stand out on a corner peacefully looking for labor. When they would be out there, they would constantly get confronted by anti\u2019s telling them to leave and to go back from were they came from."
"He is curious to learn about things, especially those concerning God or things that are not clear to him. He longs to find the secret behind Jesus\u2019 existence, and wonders about the power of God, just like many children. He portrays a naughty boy who does not think before he acts, and is often driven by his emotions. Such is seen when he is trying to hide from his teacher. Like Sonny, Ozzie does not care where the path would lead him, as long as that path is not directed towards his teacher. He also tries to run away from those who do not understand him, and seeks understanding and affection from those he loves."
"Corporate lawyers on the other hand are called when business advice is needed or they do what\u2019s best in the interest of the corporation they are working for but they are also known for many different names too \u201cA corporate lawyer is also known as In-House Counsel, Staff Attorney, Deputy General Counsel, General Counsel and Chief Legal Officer\u201d. They have many duties that require a strong background in several different areas which means that you would have to have writing, negotiating and managerial skills. Corporate lawyer salaries could range from $66,000 to $170,000 but could only be possible with the education of having a juris doctorate degree that is received from an accredited law school by the American Bar Association. The job of a family lawyer could be a lot more emotional due to the life changing decisions that are made in court."
"Regarding the staff of the institution, the directors Irvin and Ruth are responsible for hiring. For hiring criteria, there are no special qualifications required unless employed for a special job, i.e., nurse or teacher. They simply refer to the desire to work with children, ability to follow instructions, love the children and being a Christian."
"Retribution has also been a goal for punishment. Logically if a killer is put to death then there would be no more killings. American society seems to favor retribution. An eye for an eye has been a law for ages. In a pro death penalty article, the author believes that, \u201cWhen someone takes a life, the balance of justice is disturbed. Unless that balance is restored, society succumbs to a rule of violence. Only the taking of the murderer\u2019s life restores the balance and allows society to show convincingly that murder is an intolerable crime which will be punished in kind.\u201d [2] This ideology has many flaws, mainly with morality issues. For example, if the country is punishing one for killing, what gives the country the right to kill?"
"Upon arrival they are greeted by a white waitress who tells them the diner is full however, she invites them to wait for a seat. In this restaurant there is a section for white people and there is a section for Negro people. In the Negro section of the restaurant there are plenty of free seats and Ward decides to sit there and try and discuss the issues with a Negro person. The entire diner is silenced by Wards bold move."
"Unfortunately (and ironically) for Indigenous Australians, Great Britain no longer controlled Australia. The world\u2019s newest federation was becoming the working man\u2019s paradise \u2013 freed from the oppressive shadows of British and European class structures. In a strange perversion of Marxist philosophy, the New Australians adopted a xenophobic national attitude reflected in publications of the day. The Lone Hand \u2018s inaugural issue in the early 1900\u2019s, proclaimed an \u201cHonest, Clean, White Australia\u201d and The Bulletin constantly referred to \u201cThe Asiatic Menace\u201d (Plate, 2001)."
"The Reds won the Civil War for many reasons, but some are specifically more important than others. Some factors such as\u2026 Geographical advantage \u00a0Strong leadership Unity and organisation \u00a0Support Paragraph 1 (Short) (6 mins) The geographical advantage of the Reds helped them with the Civil war because it provided them with military benefits that the Whites did not have. Geographical Factors \u00a0Reds: Held central area of Western Russia \u2013 Moscow + Petrograd = population for conscription \u00a0Whites: Scattered amongst Russia."
"He tends to use them more so when his father is telling a story. Such as when his father told him a story about what happened when a friend of his mowed the lawn. Supposedly, the law mower cut off his foot and this led to young Sedaris picturing a \u201c\u2026man jumping into his car and pressing on the accelerator with his bloody stump, a warm foot settled in his lap like a sleeping puppy\u201d (49). This use of gory detail draws the reader\u2019s attention to the important part of the story, which is the father. Although his tone in his story is unique, his structure follows the same pattern that many others do."
"Instead of calling Curley\u2019s wife by her name they say \u201cCurley\u2019s woman\u201d, \u201ca tart\u201d , \u201cthe new kid\u201d, etc. If men talked to her more and started calling her by her name Curley\u2019s wife wouldn\u2019t flirt as much and would feel way more valuable than she did. In conclusion, even though people don\u2019t see that Curley\u2019s wife has more to her than being a flirt, she only wants attention, and grabs it when she has the chance."
"Each caste system memorizes a phrase \u201ca hundred and twenty times three times a week for thirty months\u201d, they are conditioned to say that they better than all the other caste systems. \u201cOh no, I don\u2019t want to play with the Delta children and Epsilons are still worse. They\u2019re too stupid to be able to read or write\u2026I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m a Beta\u201d(27-28) Hypnopaedia is the most common method of teaching values and morals but it\u2019s also a strong method of manipulating people\u2019s minds. But it creates the loss of individuality because no one has the freedom on speech but instead they are all brainwashed to say the same thing over and over again."
"Very few who go into nursing only for the salary stay in it.\u201d Anyone interested in nursing should keep in mind that there are always exceptions to the principle of working hard for ones pay. Not all nurses have an equivalent work ethic, and not every individual is cut out to perform in the nursing community. Another nurse claims that they \u201cwould insist that we all work hard for the money \u2014 back then and now. And as American RNs, we are the highest compensated nurses in the world.\u201d Compensation for one\u2019s hard work is not a misunderstood principle, however some nurses do not feel as if they are being paid appropriately Despite this, true professionals are completely in love with their jobs, and this is what separates them from those that only care about the lucrative aspects of their professions. traits allow them to adapt well to basically any medical situation or circumstance. This diversity between individuals widens the talent pool in which nurses dwell and compete against each other. As a result of these talents, \u201cnurses may choose to specialize in specific types of treatments, health conditions, patient populations or body systems, specific job duties can vary amongst specialties.\u201d Happiness can develop from any basic construct of the human condition, meaning that it can be found anywhere. Money can in fact make a person happy, but just as money cannot last forever, neither can the happiness brought on by money. True happiness stems from the relationships that exist between individuals that truly care about one another."
"\u201cGod, when will you create a woman who will be fulfilled in herself, a full human being, not anybody\u2019s appendage? I was born alone, and I shall die alone. What have I gained from all this? Yes, I have many children, but what do I have to feed them on? In my life. I have to work myself to the bone to look after them. I have to give them my all. And if I am lucky enough to die in peace, I even have to give them my soul. They will worship my dead spirit to provide for them: it will be hailed as a good spirit so long as there are plenty of yams and children in the family, but if anything should go wrong, if a young wife does not conceive or there is a famine, my dead spirit will be blamed. When will I be free?\u201d (p.186)"
"Your assignment is to compare the missions of the UNIA and the NAACP and write about each organization\u2019s approaches to confronting discrimination. You will then assume the role of a young African American living in the 1920s who has joined one of the organizations and explain your reasons for joining in a brief paragraph. Before you get started, look over the NAACP\u2019s mission statement, the Explanation of the Objects of the Universal Negro Improvement Association, and what you have previously learned about the two groups."
"After some so long minutes, they let us go. The think that really made us feel that we were inferior was the fact that one of the cars was following us through the neighborhood until we got out. That experience was the most shameful one I ever been into. I really hate cops since this experience. Being a minority and particularly black is not a crime. I totally presume that most of the police are like that. Racial bias and discrimination are existent in the minds of many individuals, some of whom may have, if it is at all possible, a justification for such thoughts."
"We decode it base on the facts and opinionated perceptions we have towards it. But it has no definite meaning. Love is solely a being. It is part of the world as much as we are part of the world. We and the love should be synchronized because it is a part of us, it is us. Love has the deepest eloquent that exists. We may always claim that we understand the love we are willing to give or may it be the love we are able to receive from other human beings, but the truth is that, we do not. To love is to feel that you are alive because of simultaneously having to feel distinct emotions. Love is not just a feeling."
"However, legalized abortions can also go against many religious beliefs, it can sometimes cause psychological problems to mothers, and it can also reduce the number of adoptable babies. Abortion denies the word of God, as the Bible states in the 6th Commandment that \u2018Thou shalt not kill\u2019 (Exodus 20:13). Also, in the Bible, God does not distinguish between babies and fetuses, he recognizes the baby at the time it is conceived (ProCon, 2018). Because of this, many people believe that abortion should be illegal, as it does not follow the Bible."
"We can aid to reduce the damage taken by the earth`s atmosphere by reducing our carbon footprint by walking and cycling to work and school, and less use on electricity. Although global warming is a natural phenomenon, we are severely contributing to making it worse. The solution to fight global warming starts with raising awareness. For future generations and nature."
"Finally, there is the mirror principle which is the most controversial of these principles. The mirror principle simply means that the register should reflect the true nature of the title of the property concerning the rights and interest of the respective individuals. Hence, when an inspection of a register is done, it should reveal information such as \u201cowner, the nature of his ownership, any limitations on his ownership and any rights enjoyed by other persons over the land that are adverse to the owner. The reason behind this principle is clear, by applying this principle; the purchaser would know the exact true situation or condition of the title of the property by simply reviewing the register whilst any other party can be certain that their rights will be protected. However, like mentioned above, this principle comes under heavy scrutiny as it isn\u2019t fully complied with in United Kingdom. Even after the Land Registration Act 2002, the register doesn\u2019t not give a clear indication as it is suppose to."
"Once, when I heard muffled voices approaching my hut, I felt a surge of fury because I believed my private place was out of bounds to any intruders. I actually armed myself with a stick to ward off the unwelcomed destroyers of my peace. Luckily, the voices faded away. I was still King of my Realm. By evening, the lengthening shadows are not the only cues for me to bid farewell to my hideaway; birds calling home to roost also provide a filling finale. Before darkness descends, I bid adieu to my beloved hideaway. By now, my tension has dissipated, I am fully de-stressed and I am suffused with tranquility. I am ready to face the world."
"Each day of in the novel is narrated from the perspective of the generals from the two sides; James Longstreet and Robert E. Lee on the Confederacy\u2019s side and John Buford and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain on the Union\u2019s side. Michael Shaara narrates the story of Gettysburg, which is among the largest battles in North America\u2019s history to establish the causes of the Civil War. Additionally, he tries to establish the motivations, which led to long-established friends facing each other in battle."
"Steinbeck purposely had done this which shows a sign of loneliness in her character. Curley doesn\u2019t spend enough time with his wife, leading failure to satisfy her, either emotionally or physically. The lack of communication has pushed her into continuously looking for companionship, the quote \u201cThink I don\u2019t like to talk to somebody ever\u2019 once in a while?\u201d shows a sign of loneliness. She is isolated from the other ranch workers because they try avoiding her and not speaking with her as a fear of upsetting the boss\u2019s son (Curley), this clearly explains that Curley does not give her the attention she craves and desires. Her relationship isn\u2019t going really well as she has been looking for pleasure and flirting with other men. Curley isn\u2019t someone who is always there for her nor loving."
"During our childhood he protects us from all the problems we fear to face. He is our provider, our Man Friday who has a solution to all our anxieties. As we grow up he evolves to be our friend and a guardian angle who not only protects but also let us make our mistakes and learn from them."
"Evidently, many communities which consist of immigrant youth lack resources for them to rely on, in order to help them transition successfully into their new culture and surroundings. Also, as previously mentioned, arising family conflict can further impede this aspect for immigrant youth. That being said, in Abbotsford there is an existing community service called the Abbotsford Community Services that offers programs designed specifically for immigrant youth, which addresses these two situations."
"In the years leading up to the Civil War, numerous laws were passed that not only prevented slavery from expanding to the North, but also limited states\u2019 rights. The Missouri Compromise was one of the first to do so. Senator Henry Clay arranged an imaginary latitude line at 36\u00b030\u2019 North and slavery above this line was prohibited, while territories south of this line were permitted to have slaves."
"From the above examples and analysis, it is clearly evident that students\u2019 low success rates in school result from lack of parental involvement, teachers\u2019 ineffective methods of instruction, and lack of motivation and determination from the student. As a result, this can be resolved through teamwork among the parents, teachers, and students who realize that doing well in schoo! requires active participation and critical thinking skills that can be developed through new methods of teaching (i.e. constructivism) and through students\u2019 positive mindset to unlock their infinite potential by following their passion and interests. Thus, every student can succeed by developing a positive mindset"
"Throughout the speech, Lincoln develops a strong appeal of an ethos which makes him credible and trustworthy. Trust is needed for him because of the chaos the country is in; a nation divided because of unspeakable acts of slavery and inequality. As an authority figure and an honorable man, it was not hard for him to persuade the American people. The fact that Lincoln is the President of the \u201chome of the brave\u201d speaks for itself as ethos because of his authority as the leader of the country (\u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner Lyrics\u201d)."
"Everything can be avoided if the police would have better trainings. I understand that we are all human beings but not everyone if physically and mentally fit for this type of career. A police officer must be compassionate, capable of thinking critically, not easily offended or excited but most importantly being capable of using restraining or using force while not being convicted of police brutality. The best way of training is to start with the right people. According to some training experts, recruitment is key. The recruiters most have life experience and people skills so they are able to relate with people from all different backgrounds. \u201cWhen someone has been in danger, whether it be a fight or a car accident, he or she tends to learn to see the danger approaching and find ways to prevent it from happening or react to it\u201d (Griffith 2015). According to the Washington post, for the past 6 years all recruiters from Washington state had created a new training that would produce \u201cguardians of democracy\u201d who serve and protect instead of \u201cwarriors\u201d who conquer and control."
"He implies that ? because in every animal that walks upright the deficiency of the fluids that fill the muscles appears first in the highest part. The face first grows lank and wrinkled; then the neck; then the breast and arms; the lower parts continuing to the last as plump as ever: so that covering all above with a basket, and regarding only what is below the girdle, it is impossible of two women to tell an old one from a young one\u201d. His purpose here is to assure his friend that there are no doubts or fear to have on the corporal pleasure of an old woman."
"Secondly, Atwood uses war diction and diction connoting powerlessness to convey the speaker\u2019s feelings towards the war. The use of words such as \u201ccorpses\u201d, \u201csmoke\u201d, \u201cjungles are flaming\u201d evoke strong emotions in the over the speaker who feels powerless over the situation. Atwood creates a dramatic contrast between this inhuman battle for life and the speaker\u2019s tranquil life although agitated conscience. The war diction is employed to establish a horrific image of the war and reach out o human feelings of hate towards the battle and desire to reduce the pain and violence. Atwood draws attention an essential concept that defies the audience\u2019s reflection upon the Vietnam war. The speaker suggests that perhaps sitting in a chair \u201cas quietly as a fuse\u201d could have made her \u201cthe cause\u201d of the disturbance of peace in the world because with every moment that passes by and she is unable to take action against mass killings, unfortunate innocent people die. The contrast between war and powerlessness is highlighted in every stanza with the use of strong was imagery indicated by the word choice connoting these ideas."
"Paradoxically, Peyman et al (2014) in their study reported that a greater majority of students preferring only one learning style was found to be auditory or aural, and for students with bimodal, it was found that 46% of the students preferred the styles kinaesthetic and visual. The learning styles kinaesthetic, visual and aural made up the highest tri-modal preference. Fleming (1995) also found that the most commonly used model in the learning process is the aural mode. He further mentioned that in a higher-education system, the kinaesthetic mode has the least tendency molded by teachers in teaching (cited in Othman & Amiruddin, 2010)."

"Six months ago, Jane was living in New York during a school break. During the break, Jane telephoned her father asking to be allowed to return to Quebec. John advised her to stay the remainder of the break and try to get along with her mother. Two days later, at 6:00pm, Anne returned from work to find a message on her answering machine from Jane, saying that she was going to live with her uncle, Billy, in California."
"In global integration, movement of people features prominently. A majority of destination countries prefer entry of high skilled laborers over low skilled workers, refugees and asylum seekers. Modern world migration is extremely precipitated by the rising inequality levels in human security and income between and among developed and developing countries. In addition, other driving factors of modern day migration include uneven economic developments, technological advancements in communication and transport and rapid demographic changes. While migrating from one location to another, migrants retain transnational connections rather than social existence (Castles ; Miller, 2009). The onset of global economic slur in 2008 elicited a hiatus in a number of these factors, thereby undermining the long term significance of these factors. This paper sets out to explore the modern world\u2019s factors that drive migration."
"It is not as though Prufrock is doing this in a hopeful manner, though. Instead we get the impression that he is reflecting on time as if it is plentiful only if you take advantage of it and perhaps he feels he did not Another aspect of this poem that is important is the interpretation of it is the speaker and the audience. Although the audience is never clearly identified, several assumptions can be made. It seems as though Prufrock is simply reflecting on life to himself. He makes several statements that would allow a reader to arrive at this conclusion. Throughout the poem, he asks several rhetorical questions of himself. In line 62, he asks \u201cand how should I presume?\u201d. He asks himself the same question again in line 68 and then follows with another \u201cand how should I begin?\u201d. These questions lead the reader to believe that the poem represents Prufrock\u2019s inner-thoughts about life. This is important to consider because if the audience was anyone but Prufrock himself, the poem would more than likely take a very different course."
"With public demonstrations, rallies, boycotts and freedom rides, the African American race was given the right to ride on the same public transportation, eat at the same restaurants, and go to the same schools as the white race. The Civil Rights Movement also gave African Americans the right to register to vote. Since Martin Luther King\u2019s time, there have emerged many African Americans who have become very successful and influential like Oprah Winfrey, Sean \u201cP. Diddy\u201d Combs, and Shawn \u201cJay-Z\u201d Carter to name a few."
"Reactions to the Chinese Exclusion Act were considered to be mixed, with various groups in support and in opposition of the act. Anti-Chinese groups took this event as an opportunity to rise to power, such as the Supreme Order of Caucasians, which was supported by California\u2019s governor John Bigler. Advocates of the act called Chinese immigrants and Chinese-Americans racist terms such as \u201ccoolies\u201d and solely blamed them as well as other ethnic groups of immigrants for their economic downfall and hardships. On the other hand, the Chinese collectively and passionately opposed the law, as it persecuted and oppressed them and destroyed many lives by deporting and tearing family members apart. The Chinese Exclusion Act was the very first of its kind, despite growing hostilities towards immigrants in general."
"Havisham differs to both Before You Were Mine and Follower. Relationships are presented much more distressing as Miss Havisham from Dickens \u2018s Great Expectations is jilted at the communion table on her nuptials twenty-four hours. The verse form makes a generalised negative position against all men- her relationship with another adult male has destroyed her and therefore she wants retaliation on males. She hates her spinster state- of which her single household name invariably reminds her."
"It is the world\u2019s well-known article that sparked heated discussion across the world. Despite our squeamishness about cultural stereotypes, there are tons of studies out there that show marked and quantifiable differences when it comes to parenting between Chinese and Westerners. For instance, the fact is that Chinese parents can do things that seem unimaginable to Westerners even legally incapable of action Chinese mothers can say \u201cHey fatty lose some weight\u201d to their daughters (Amy Chua, 2011)."
"The profession of social work is also expected to play a key role in addressing the increasing and diversifying society needs such as the LGBT community and immigrants in the United States who face a wide range of social problems (Chang-Muy & Congress, 2015). Increasing challenges faced by the community that threaten the livelihood of people means an increased demand and responsibility for social workers. Technology has also been integrated in social work to enhance how social workers perform their responsibilities that involve reaching to multicultural groups in society (Chang-Muy & Congress, 2015). Social work educational programs will also continue to expand to equip social workers with the right and adequate skills to help them in effectively performing their roles and responsibilities. This is also important in increasing the competency level of social workers who are responsible for performing complex roles within the society (Chang-Muy & Congress, 2015)."
"Most people in our society prescribe to the belief that women are better at raising children than men. (hooks 83) a. Feminist interventions called attention to the value and importance of male parenting both in regards to the well-being of the child as well as becoming a symbol of gender equity. (hooks 82) b. Diffusion of childbearing and the responsibilities of childrearing play a role to society as a whole and include men as well as women. (Firestone 247) II. Firestone and hooks devise different demands for women. A. hooks prefers women partake equally in marriage and childrearing responsibilities."
"In 1898, Hawaii officially got annexed. Another example of American imperialism due to its economic gains was the Spanish-American war. In the late 19th century, Spain had colonized Cuba. The Spanish treated Cubans harshly and put whoever revolted in reconcentration camps where they were given inhumane treatment. The United States decided to free Cuba from Spain."
"He/she will always be there for you. They are not perfect, but at least they will always look out for you and never do anything intentionally to hurt you. They are there to find national solutions to the many unexpected problems that life presents for us. \u201cBest friends\u201d are very important to us, because we share with them something which are secrets things that have not be known by anybody. They are very generous people. For example, when we have not enough money, they lend us. When we fall into bad condition, they cheer us up. They support us."
"Development of social skills is determined by ones social environment and the behavior adopted from different individuals. Social skills are learnt through interactions with individuals like family members, friends, and peers. Social skills are mostly learned through observation by watching what other people are doing. This influences the behavior adopted by learners because they will want to portray the same characteristics they saw in a person. In the process of learning, children in most cases would want to exhibit behaviors they copied from adults."
"This is an example of how Lennie has no control of his strength, and his emotions. With Lennie\u2019s habit of petting things and hurting them, foreshadows Curley\u2019s wife\u2019s death. As soon as Lennie starts to talk about how he likes to pet soft things the atmosphere builds up. Lennie does not understand sex therefore does not understand that Curleys wife is \u2018flirting\u2019. Soon he is petting her hair, which is another soft thing to pet. Again Lennie panics as she constantly asks him to stop and panics herself. Lennie puts her hand over her mouth to stop her screaming and subsequently she is dead. These events tell us that Lennie inevitably would keep on killing."
"In the second presentation titled \u201cMisunderstood\u201d, you find a teenage male dressed in dark cloth and appears to be \u201cGothic\u201d. Beside him is an older man dressed more professional with gray hair and glasses. The older man noticed the young teenager with a certain look on his face and started to ask him if everything was okay. Then the older man started to talk to teenager. The older man interacted through tradition and the roles played by historical people."
"In all episodes, Will is very proud of his heritage. He stands up for what he believes in and this is what made the show popular. Blacks were talking about what they believed in and people were listening. When the audience took interest in this sitcom, more people began to see the rise in more black actors and actresses throughout the years. Blacks were also rising in status and having political views. They were being transformed to the center of the stage, the white man\u2019s stage and whites were accepting the different norm."
"Animals, who are the most exposed to violence by humans and that cannot speak like human beings, try to tell something with their eyes, have the characteristics of humankind, such as humor, talking, mourning, holding a grudge, and empathy, except for the thinking skill that belongs to mankind. In these animals, cats, and dogs, that we call street animals, who were domesticated by humankind, came together with people to where people are."
"Figure [ 1 ] [ 1 ] Corporate Identity Mix \u2013 Adopted from [ (Balmer & Soenen, 1999)] Corporate culture Corporate culture was devoted proper attention since the early stages in expanding the corporate identity concept beyond the visual identity (Baker & Balmer, 1997; Hatch & Schultz, 1997; Stuart, 1999; Dowling, 1986; Markwick & Fill, 1997; Stuart, 1999; Melewar & Karaosmangolu, 2006). Culture epitomises the consensus within a company about how activities should be accomplished and is conceived as a result of a group\u2019s shared experience and learning with respect to atters of external adaptation and internal integration\u201d (Schein, 1985) in (Melewar & Karaosmangolu, 2006). It is therefore, represented in the shared values and beliefs among corporate members and also includes corporate philosophy, mission, and subcultures (Melewar & Karaosmangolu, 2006)."
"One of the daughters Jing-Mei changes her Chinese name and gives American name \u2018June\u2019. We see that, One of the major cultural conflict is language, due to linguistic difference there is a lack of communication between the mothers and daughters. According to American culture, the daughters want freedom and does not want pressure from their mothers\u2019 side but in China children must obey their parents."
"The story was that of a misogynistic man who can only escape his dysfunctional home life by reading about others\u2019 pain. He is leading his family into a bitter spiral of hate, and if he doesn\u2019t do something about it soon he will lose all that he holds dear to him. In the play the man virtually sees his life played out in a book apart from the fact that he is a man who has an underlying hatred for women and the book character is a black man who has a fundamental loathing of white people. As the man reads to the end of the book, he finds that the book character falls into alcoholism and bitter self-pity and starts to think about what would happen if he continued to carry on the way that his life is carrying him."
"In conclusion, Didion realizes that her \u201cmarked cards\u201d cannot carry her though life. Didion is reviewing the actions in her past that were reflections of her misplaced self-respect. She cannot carry around her false credentials in hope to gain respect from others. After looking back on the falsely identified tragedy that changed her life, Didion understands that self-respect has nothing to do with the people you surround yourself with. Who you are does not reflect upon your past, or your reputation, but upon your present self. And the courage you project."
"Those are just very few of the thousands of things you can do to lift your self esteem. Teenagers self esteem hardly stay high at all times. Most likely you will experience those days when you wake up in the morning and you look in the mirror and a huge pimple is sitting right on your forehead, or you ate too much the night before and you feel fat and sluggish. Its okay to feel that once in awhile it is normal, I mean of course your self esteem isn\u2019t going to go up when you have a huge pimple on your face, but you can do things to help. Don\u2019t focus on the negatives try to always think positive."
"The speech has been written from a young adults point of view, allowing the students to further connect with the speaker, and what they are saying. The incorporation of informal language and colloquialisms has allowed the speech to come across as personal, and yet at the same time touching those listening. The informal language connects to the disengaged students who have been made to attend the talk, and allows all students to be able to listen and take in what is being said."
"Open communication between parents and their children will help increase trust and decrease the problems of drug and alcohol abuse, teen pregnancy, and crime. Also, open communication between a husband and wife will bring much understanding, appreciation, trust, and much more. Being \u201copen\u201d with each other is something that is essential in a happy family, but may be very hard to do. Discussing our feelings amongst each other can help us to have a strong and more attached relationship in the family."
"There are examples of superlatives in the text and also examples of exaggeration. For example: \u201cawesome sidekick\u201d \u201cgreatest little boy\u201d \u201cMeanest cat around\u201d \u201cfastest kid in town\u201d \u201cJake has become famous\u201d. It shows that the vocabulary of the people reading this is limited. We learn that the audience is maybe a little bit uneducated and is situated in the middle or low class of the social and economic system. Unlike the Daily Mail, Roald Dahl uses interesting comparisons and intriguing words. For example,\u201dIt was the same with a young person writing an essay\u201d."
"People that debate having a stricter gun control law think about the safety of their friends and family if there was less chances of buying a gun. Even though the citizens that debate this side believe the crime rate would decrease tremendously with stricter laws, it is not guaranteed. If a criminal wants a gun, they will find any way to obtain one, even if its done illegally. Imagine a family peacefully hanging out in the living room watching T.V. together and all of a sudden someone breaks in from the back window. The unfamiliar man holds them all at gunpoint. What do they do? The oldest son hears what\u2019s going on in the room nearby but doesn\u2019t have a gun or weapon to safely save his family without the predator seeing him."
"I have been actively striving to further develop my knowledge, skills and experience in the medical field though the several positions I have held. I am currently a Radiation Therapist Intern at the Massachusetts General Hospital/ Brigham and Women Hospital / DFCI Boston, MA, where I have been attached to since 2006. My responsibilities include accurate positioning of patients for treatment, operation of advanced medical equipment, quality assurance and providing competent patient care. I am also in charge of assistant the oncologist and the physician with treatment plans during delicate procedures."
"Twenty states with capital punishment laws consequently established sixteen as the minimum age for execution\u201d (Daily Mail Reporter). \u201cIn 2005, the U. S. Supreme Court ruled that sentencing juveniles to death is unconstitutional. The court ruled that life without parole for anything less than homicide was unconstitutional as well\u201d (Daily Mail Reporter). The only catch is that the child can be tried and convicted to be considered an adult in the eyes of the court. That means that no matter their age, they can still be sentenced to death. But no matter what, a child is still a child."
"Following the riots it was announced that two officers Stacey Koon And Lawrence Powell would stand trial yet again, but this time in federal court for violating Rodney Kings civil rights. Both were convicted and sentenced to prison terms {Brutality In Los Angles 7} The Rodney King video and trial sparked a question in many peoples mind through out the nation, OHow big of a problem is police brutality? Little did they know that this would be the beginning of a streak of police related violence."
"Cases of money laundering have accelerated with the innovation of cashless and virtual currencies innovations. Stokes analyses how the Bitcoin and Linden dollar as examples of virtual currencies, can be used by an online criminal to launder money. Published in the ICT Law journal, the article integrates the legal frameworks with the ICT and examines how the two can interoperate to curb fraud. A discussion on Money Laundering Regulations 2007, helps understand how the law can be applied in virtual currency trading."
"It improves the development of human capital and that equipped with an individual\u2019s well-being and opportunities for better living .It ensures the capabilities and is strongly associated with various socioeconomic variables such as lifestyle, income, and fertility for both individuals and societies. This increase in productivity also leads towards new sources of earning which increase the economic growth of a country (Saxton, 2000). The social and economic development of any country is directly linked with education. The children\u2019s education plays an important role in producing the productive graduates who will become great leader and manpower for the country thus responsible for the country\u2019s economic and social development (Ali et.al, 2009).Ethiopia has recently experienced massive improvement in access to education. Primary school enrolment has increased five-fold since 1994, and there are now more than 14 million children in school compared to five million in 2000. Primary school enrollment has increased substantially but only about half of those enrolled manage to complete primary level education .However; educational investment continues to be low in many developing countries including Ethiopia. Moreover, wide educational disparities are observed, with rural children typically receiving less education than urban counter parts. School attendance is lowest in rural areas due to lack of provision and alternative occupations (EDHS, 2016). Primary schools have over 90% of seven year olds enrolled although only about half complete the primary level education. This situation varies from one region to the other and it is even worst in, such as Somali and Afar regions. In Ethiopia were approximately two-third (75%) primary school ages children are age in grade not correspondence (congruence). Due to the fact that schooling investments are typically made at the household level, poor households must make decisions about the optimum allocation of scarce resources towards child schooling (EDHS, 2016). The role of education on economic growth has been found to be positive and significant not only in monetary terms but also in physical terms, such as farm efficiency and labor productivity. Education has also been found to be a significant factor in the reduction of poverty, improvement in income distribution and various dimensions of social, demographic and political development. Interestingly the relative significance of human capital is higher in developing countries. Considering education to be a tool of paramount importance for mobilization of human resources for sustainable socio-economic growth, the government has been involved in formulating and implementing numerous policies to develop and improve the education system in order to make it compatible with requirements of the country (Burney and Irfan, 2013).Primary education is absolutely critical to education as it serves as a base foundation for secondary and higher education and a critical driver of economic growth. Education of children serving for long run through augmenting family income, providing economic support during old age, enhancing economic status and increasing agricultural productivity (Axinn,2011,Lloyd and Blanc, 2013). Ethiopia is one of the poor country and low level of human capital. In Ethiopia the number of children in school has been increase in the last two decades from as low as 2 million in the 1990\u2019s to over 23.5 million in 2016,almost more than three times its gross enrollment rates from as low as 30% in 1990\u2019s to 96%, in EDHS, 2016.The primary school net attendance ratio and gross attendance ratio for the population of age 7-14 year old 7 1.5% and 95% respectively and the primary school net attendance ratio between rural and urban 83% and70% respectively (2016). However several of challenges still exist. More than 25% of children who enroll in first grade dropout before they complete their first school year and wide gap persist between rural and urban.Nearly19% of female and 14% of male did not go during to school during the 2016 school year .According data from 2016 EDHS, over 50% of population is illiterate nearly 58% of rural and 21% of urban. More over it is a country of the young with children under age 15 years accounting for above 47% of the population (CSA, 2016).Children\u2019s schooling in Ethiopia faces several problems on demand side and supply sides. Particularly, the researcher was focused analysis of the demand side determinants of schooling is important make in bridging the wider gap problems constringing educational outcomes in the primary school. Opposing this researcher aims answering what determinants children schooling outcome in Ethiopia.Therefore researcher motivated by need to assess the situation with the emphasis on the demand side factors of schooling and show improving it. Particularly to examine factors that influence children\u2019s schooling outcomes. The important direction of educational outcomes are constrained a number of factors right from official entry age to successive enrollment in equivalent age through completion. At school official entry age, children are either not enrolled in the time of survey or may not be enrolled at all. At school age-grade equivalent (congruence), children either age in grade equivalent in the time of survey or may not be age in grade congruence (equivalent) at all. To understand the determinants that affect this dimension of children educational outcome can guide policy makers to prioritize appropriate strategy to such groups of children. The study examine school attendance dimensions using information from the 2016 EDHS data on weather children in sample have ever attained school, weather children in currently school and weather children\u2019s age in grade equivalent (congruence).policy aimed solving challenges faced by such group of children may require different consideration."
"As the previous section which had mentioned that the old man may become the offender of the domestic violence as he had killed his sick wife. Under some of the statistics or research in the past was found out that most of the victim in a violence were women, such as the reported from Social Welfare Department shown that there are 86.1% of female which had abuse experience before (Figure 1), which means this is an atypical case when we argued that the old man was also the victim in the violence. But there are some other studies shown that lots of males had to face different abuse, for example, the statistics of types of abuse by victim\u2019s sex (Figure 2) found out that there is 64% male who had faced physical abuse (Social Welfare Department, 2016). Besides, there is a research called \u2018suicide rates by gender in Hong Kong\u2019 (Figure 3) reported that male got a higher suicide rate than female (HKJC Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention, 2016)."
"The stable buck on the ranch, known as Crooks, doesn\u2019t believe that George and Lennie will ever obtain their dream. He says that all migrant workers have the same dream, and it doesn\u2019t works out for any of them. Page.79-80 \u201cYou guy are just kiddin\u2019 yourself. You\u2019ll talk about it a hell of a lot but you won\u2019t get no land. Seems like ever\u2019 guy got land in his head, they never get none in their hand\u201d"
"The poster once again is in the same style, the image shows a crowd of violent hooligans in the distance and a man quite close holding a baseball at in an aggressive manor. You as the soldier are approaching the crowd to help stop it. The word needed is used in the slogan, this gives the reader a bit of self assurance that makes them feel as if the army needs them as appose to wanting them. The picture works terrifically with the slogan so that it can be understood at a glance."
"Not only does Helene take on many different responsibilities, she also manipulates her family, to feel as distant from her family and background as possible: \u201c[She] enjoyed manipulating her daughter and her husband. She would sigh sometimes just before falling asleep, thinking that she had indeed come far enough away from the Sundown House\u201d . By doing this, Helene can escape feelings of disgrace and live an ethical life. Helene leads a moral and respectable life because it is motivated by her own fear of rejection by society."
"Although in the last seer series \u201cThe Returning\u201d Elise and the Father had a family relationship. Elise escaped from the Capitol Building and found her sister and Aaron was talking to her in her thought that she was light. \u201cRemember what I call you daughter you are the light of the world\u201d (Dekker, The Returning 188). This demonstrates that Elise was alone the whole but the Father was talking in her thought that she was more than she thought. This conclude the family theme with the Father and Elise bond together in thought."
"The power and sentiment of poetry depict Bedouins\u2019 human experience outside the confines of culture. The real emotions they experience in their everyday lives are exclusively revealed in poetry to maintain the system of social hierarchy. The book focuses primarily on women in this community who willingly participate in maintaining the culture whole. The role of honor to maintain Bedouin society intact is very important."
"The mission of the early childhood and childcare center will be to provide affordable, accessible, and quality early childhood learning and care centers for the families in Alberta (Makovichuk, Hewes, Lirette, & Thomas, 2014). With the growing economic needs, the center will offer an opportunity for parents to provide an effective environment for child development while they engage in other economic activities. One important value in the center will be safety, as the center will ensure that all learners are safe in their encounters (Province of Alberta, 2019)."
"Jared Pingleton (2014) argued that \u201cSpanking is most effective as a deterrent to undesirable behavior for young preschoolers\u201d (para. 4). Although it is true that when a child does some mistake and we spank him, then most likely child does not repeat that mistake again. However this control over the child would be only because of the threat of being spanked again, if he or she is not repeating his mistakes it does not mean that he or she understands that what he did is wrong, once that threat will go then most probably he will repeat his mistakes. According to Gershoff (2013) \u201cSpanking is not an effective technique; in fact it makes the child\u2019s behavior worse not better\u201d (p.133). \u201cWhenever parents spank their child at that time children could not understand that why his behavior was wrong and what he should do instead\u201d (Gershoff , 2013, p.134). Most of the children become stubborn because of frequent spanking, child actually repeating his mistakes and taking spanking granted as well and don\u2019t care about being punished. This method does not affecting the child emotionally anymore. He feels that spanking is at the most that parents will do to him and he can have his own direction and becomes disobedient."
"In addition, there some interesting facts and things that I did not know about my first name. \u2018There are three different countries that use my name which are English, Italy and Dutch.\u2019 (Campbell, Mike. \u2018Meaning, Origin and History of the Name Samantha.\u2019 Behind the Name, 2019, www.behindthename.com/name/samantha.) In my opinion, there is such an amazing biblical meaning to my first name. According to Names, (Biblical Baby. \u2018Samantha Baby Name Meaning, Origin and Description of Biblical Character.\u2019 Biblical, 2005, www.biblical-baby-names.com/meaning-of-samantha.html.), the biblical meaning of Samantha is intended to be a feminine form of SAMUEL, using the name suffix antha (possibly inspired by Greek \u041e\u00b1\u041e\u0405\u041e\u0451\u041e\u0457\u041f\u201a (anthos) meaning \u201cflower\u201d). The meaning of my name in the testimony of God is God hearing. In the 18th century the name was uncommon until the year of 1964. In 1964, the name became common due to the main character in Bewitched had the name of Samantha."
"Third, by enforcing children to avoid overeating will only cause mental problems associated with the tension and stress on when and how to eat their food. Fourth, parents should set an example on how they eat their food, because a child will act the same way as how they see their parents eating. Lastly, by stigmatizing the unhealthy behaviors due to obesity, in accordance to, trying not to stigmatize the person or people, really is stigmatizing the children who are suffering from being obese."
"Imagination is creativity in action.\u00a0It allows us to explore beyond the constraints of our environment and our reality, into a world of dreams, where creativity and invention are at their strongest. Imagination and play have been shown to increase brain development and growth in children.\u00a0Telling any child that their work is \u201cwrong\u201d in any way will be a blow to their self-confidence and will have a detrimental effect on their development in that field."
"In the vast ocean of computers, the undergraduate program provided me with a strong foundation of Computer Science fundamentals. As part of my curriculum, I have taken courses in Data Structures and Algorithm, Analysis of Algorithm, Theory of Computation and Advanced Database Management System, which improved my logical skills along with my programming skills in languages such as C, C++ and PHP."
"The nature of each significant battle was accurate to what is taught in schools and aligns with other reliable sources. In general, the author didn\u2019t leave out many important details however a voice that was not a major part of the film was the voice of a woman. Although this was a predominantly male war, women around the country must have had an opinion on the war and how it affected them. In the film, the voice of black soldiers is mostly present and the voice of white officers is present but very rarely in comparison, does a woman\u2019s viewpoint come to light. The fact that this film was produced by a man automatically gives a biased viewpoint because of the way society has conditioned us to be. However, Zwick did the best he could to make this movie the least biased as possible. Glory"
"Hundreds of Muslim ghettos are already de facto following sharia, not thr French law. And in twenty years one person out of four in France will be Muslim and almost certainly poor and angry. What are then the future prospects of the multicultural France? Is is really multiculturalism to be blamed for the disastrous situation that has turned out in France? Or are the Muslims responsible for it? Probably not really. The world has already started to discover that beneath the postcard surfaces of the Eiffel Tower and romantic restaurants, the country of arrogance was very sick."
"Has it been fair? Maybe it depends upon the person how we understands the whole picture the movie tried to express. Popular media can condition the minds of the viewers. It conditions us to think and feel things as the director or the producer wants to. It doesn\u2019t really mean that what we see is always true and what others believe as portrayed in the movie is always right. We should still give people the freedom to reject or accept the ideas being presented. What can the viewers notice in this film?"
"4-4. Courtesy among members of the Armed Forces is vital to maintain discipline. Military courtesy means good manners and politeness in dealing with other people. Courteous behavior provides a basis for developing good human relations. The distinction between civilian and military courtesy is that military courtesy was developed in a military atmosphere and has become an integral part of serving in uniform."
"Section 5 of R.A. No. 9346 specifically provides that it shall take effect immediately after itspublication in two national newspapers of general circulation. This is pursuant to Article 2 oftheCivil Codewhich provides that laws shall take effect after 15 days following the completion oftheir publication either in the Official Gazette, or in a newspaper of general circulation in thePhilippines, unless it is otherwise provided.R.A. No. 9346 was published in Malaya and Manila Times, two national newspapers of generalcirculation on 29 June 2006. Accordingly, R.A. No. 9346 took effect on 30 June 2006. [2]"
"Chapter four of Veiled Sentiments showed why sexual modesty is essential to keep women\u2019s honor. Symbolism about to protect sexual modesty is found everywhere in Bedouins community. Married women are to wear a black veil and a red belt. The red belt symbolizes fertility and the black veil with the shameful act of incest. These are only some examples given in chapter four. In the Bedouin or Arab society, there are two kinds of honor: \u201cird and sharaf. \u201d Sharaf, which is usually for men, can be acquired, augmented, diminished, lost, and regained, while \u2018ird\u2019 is exclusively for women."
"I have arrived to all my classes everyday and finish all my assignment on time. I have also received recommendations from my teachers and professors saying only good things about my work in class. I am capable of doing all assignment handed to me on the job. Being a leader is no problem. My leadership skills were used for high school and college basketball. My coaches made me team captain. I helped give preparation speeches and run team plays. My friends always came to me for advice, I motivated a group of friends not to smoke marijuana, and now they cannot stop thanking me."
"Figure [ 1 ]: Percentage share of employment in the UK by sector, 1980-2008 Source: ONS 2009, cited in Faulconbridge 2010 The most profound impact has been the expansion of the service sector since the onset of globalisation in the mid-20th century. Figure 1 shows the increase in service employment from 1980 \u2013 2008. Further to this, the %GDP generated by the service sector in this same period rose by approximately 20% (OECD 1996, cited in Julius ;amp; Butler 1998), closely mirroring the data in figure 1."
"The next encounter with Curley is in chapter 3 when all the men are in the bunkhouse. Curley is clearly frustrated and agitated by the fact that he can\u2019t find his wife, a sign of weakness and lack of authority, and when he is told that Slim is at the barn he rushes out and starts interrogating him but when Slim shows that he is in control, Curley\u2019s fake ego is quickly shattered and it is obvious that he is quickly forced back into his place. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean nothing, Slim. I just ast you. \u201d"
"According to Katherine Schaeffer, overall, the share of Americans who say gun laws in the U.S. should be made stricter has increased from 52% in 2017 to 60% this year, according to a survey conducted in September. The share of Democrats who support stricter gun laws has risen 11 percentage points since 2017, while there has been a 7-point increase in support among Republicans."
"Simpson is influential in how his crime affected millions due to the unpunished murder of his ex-wife, his actions shining light on domestic violence in america, and the messy trial changing how forensics is handled in the field. Simpson was an idol to america before his murder case with his heisman trophy and his hall of fame professional career. His domestic violence attacks, however tragic did shine light on the lethality and truth of domestic violence. Simpson walking out of the courthouse a free man put everyone in forensics to shame and with the shame came new regulations so another murderer will not go unpunished. Simpson is an awful person and should not be looked up to by anyone but the results of his actions did have a strong impact on America"
"Scientists often argue that animal testing is necessary for researching for new viruses. This experiment is usually when scientists purposely give viruses to animals. So, that once there virus is in the system, they can work on the treatment. According to About Animal Testing there are other ways to find cure to viruses. There are new testing methods like vitro testing. Scientists have replicated human skin and test skin products on this replicated human skin, this method is called vitro testing. There is another method which is a computer program. This computer program takes the information from the drugs or virus and it calculates the effect of these drugs or viruses on human being. The program also calculates effects on different age groups and different genders. These methods are much more accurate then animal testing and cost a fraction of the amount. But still animal testing is costing us more money and less accurate results. Scientist should really try more alternative methods and work on them. So, animals can live there life span with freedom."
"Lenita McClain states, \u201cI am burdened daily with showing whites that blacks are people.\u201d Shelby Steele asks, \u201cAfter all, since when had white Americans taken note of anything but color when it came it blacks?\u201d Our nation, which is supposed to preserve equal rights to everyone, is weakened when certain Americans feel they are judged on a day to day basis by their skin color."
"There are many different types of child care proviso. these include: ?Mother and toddler groups- a topographic point were the yearling can socialize with other kids their age. whilst the female parent or male parent can remain and larn more ways to look after and assist with the kids development. ?Pre-school- pre-school is a private baby\u2019s room. one that is paid for by the parent. they do non make compulsory hours and the kid doesn\u2019t have a primary school topographic point already."
"It is very negative of Roosevelt and his New Deal. The highlighted points in the source are that Roosevelt has used the power and the billions of dollars he had been given ruthlessly to make a debt of 250 billion dollars, compared to the 19 billion it has been before his presidency. The point that Roosevelt had made a quarter of all the population dependent on government employment and caused prices to double was also highlighted as well as taxes rising, debts soaring and having more people on government relief."
"At first, thank you for the people who are here to listen to my speech. I\u2019m honor to be here so that I can express my strong argument in this place. Before beginning my speech, I want to ask you a question. It\u2019s a short question, but not simple. Please think carefully. Is there the most superior living species? I think most of you would be quite perplexed. Yes. You should be. As I said, it is not a simple question."
"This increase in child labor led to rise of movements that advocated for labor reform. Another thing is that the bulk of industrial workers during this period comprised of immigrants (Healey 197). These industrial workers benefitted from improved products following the introduction of better agricultural techniques. Due to a large number of the people who were willing to work in the industries, the industries paid their workers low wages, the workers worked for long hours, and above all the working conditions were deplorable (Healey 197)."
"Disguises Many characters in Twelfth Night assume disguises, beginning with Viola, who puts on male attire and makes everyone else believe that she is a man. By dressing his protagonist in male garments, Shakespeare creates endless sexual confusion with the Olivia-Viola\u2013Orsino love triangle. Other characters in disguise include Malvolio, who puts on crossed garters and yellow stockings in the hope of winning Olivia, and Feste, who dresses up as a priest\u2014Sir Topas\u2014when he speaks to Malvolio after the steward has been locked in a dark room. Feste puts on the disguise even though Malvolio will not be able to see him, since the room is so dark, suggesting that the importance of clothing is not just in the eye of the beholder. For Feste, the disguise completes his assumption of a new identity\u2014in order to be Sir Topas, he must look like Sir Topas. Viola puts on new clothes and changes her gender, while Feste and Malvolio put on new garments either to impersonate a nobleman (Feste) or in the hopes of becoming a nobleman (Malvolio). Through these disguises, the play raises questions about what makes us who we are, compelling the audience to wonder if things like gender and class are set in stone, or if they can be altered with a change of clothing."
"A twelve-year-old boy from Cleveland, Ohio was shot within seconds of law enforcement arriving to the scene. Timothy Loehmann and Frank Garmback were the two officers that responded after someone reported a black male that \u2018kept pulling a gun out of his pants and pointing it at people at the Cudell Recreation Center\u201d (BBC News). The two officers were unaware that a child was the reasoning for the 911 call, under the impression that the situation involved an armed suspect. Tamir was told to drop the weapon but did not listen, causing officer Loehmann to fire twice at close range."
"The scenario in which the students are required to call a domestic violence and suicide hotline to study the assistance offered seems like a fairly harmless study. Although it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone got hurt, there are still some ethically questionable areas surrounding it. These areas mostly revolve around the unknowing participants in the study, namely the hotline representatives. There are some measure that could have been taken that would have made the research method more ethical. Though it may not seem harmful, the research done by the students did cross some ethical boundaries."
"It is also suggested that girls are more likely to start smoking due the influence of their parents smoking than boys, showing greater correlation with the mother smoking, (Ashley et al, 2008). The results gathered from Peterson et al, (2006) study suggest that an individual is more probable to smoke at an earlier age if both parents smoke. There is a significant pattern noted between the influence an individual\u2019s parents smoking can have on the risk of the individual beginning."
"All of those confusions and misdirection kept building up and I once thought I faced the biggest tragedy of my life: living pointlessly. The piece of story of how I got through that catastrophe is not important. The result of that campaign was just beautiful. I knew the utmost meanings of doing things that I have done: to live a life that I want to. If someone says he is doing his homework continuously and keep nailing A after A after A in all of his classes with the purpose of having a highest-paid job out there and make unbelievable much money for the rest of his life, I respect that. But I don\u2019t care."
"The conflict perspective assumes that the social structure is best understood in terms of conflict or tension between the competing groups within Britain. The result of this conflict is significant economic disparity and structural inequality in education, the labor market, housing, and healthcare delivery. Specifically, society is a struggle between the privileged (the dominant group) and the exploited (the subordinate groups). Such conflicts need not be physically violent and may take the form of immigration restrictions, real estate practices, or disputes over cuts in the federal budget."
"My family loves to eat home cooked food. We have anything from tacos to spaghetti or anything that would have protein in it that would be good for me since I play sports. I will say we are not the healthiest family out there, yes we do like cookies and other stuff but a lot of the time we do try to watch how much junk food intake we have. When eating unhealthy it can damage your liver because it can add deposition of fats in the liver. Although junk food can be very tasty and good you still have to watch the intake of junk food so something bad doesn\u2019t happen to your liver as you live on in life."
"Furthermore, language is crucial for the development of autobiographical memory in children, and thus the deprivation of communicating about the past produces flaws in their early memories. Weigle and Bauer (2000) supported this when they found that deaf adults, who were not brought up with sign language, had roughly the same age for their earliest memories as hearing adults but deaf adults had significantly less early memories. Therefore, this suggests that lack of language prevents rehearsal, which supports the idea that speaking about the past is fundamental for the formation of autobiographical memories and thus the language hypothesis of CA."
"A major advantage is that the career is set to increase within the next 10 years. Another advantage for me is that crime scene investigators may work staggered day, evening, or night shifts and may have to work overtime because they must always be available to collect or analyze evidence. I enjoy having my work changing it helps me grow as a person and keeps me on my toes. A disadvantage is that there are not a lot of jobs as a forensic science technician available. Though this job is said to have a 14 percent increase by 2028 the fast growth will result in only about 2,400 new jobs over the 10 years. Though it is nice to have a changing schedule the unpredictability of the schedule will make plans and activities outside of work difficult."
"Moreover, I can actively point out the relevant catalysts and how each one can contribute to the creation or degradation of various organisms within a particular ecosystem. Bio News mentions that \u201cthese bacteria are important to humans because they play a role in the ecology of life, by decomposing wastes, both natural and man-made, for example and created nitrogen fertilizer at the root zones of certain crops\u201d (p. 1). Surely, can greatly impact on how I practice my major. After putting my expectations in the subject, I wish to correlate it on my future major which is pharmacy."
"Chiswick then goes on to say \u201cThe immigration of low-skilled workers with their dependents may reduce the income of the native population\u201d this meaning that every illegal immigrant that brings its family will potentially be lowering the average income of American citizens. This reference is of value to my research because it shows the negative effects of illegal immigration and what would happen if it continues to go on. It also shows how little immigrants get paid, and how the amount of money they make is so drastically little that it actually lowers the average American household income. Being paid so little these people would have to struggle just to get by and may turn to violence or taking multiple jobs away from U.S. citizens. Dula, Giora, Nava Kahana and Tikva Lecker \u201cHow to Partly Bounce Back the Struggle against Illegal Immigration to the Source Countries\u201d Journal of Population Economics 19 (2006):315-325 Web 6 April 2014"
"Romeo and Juliet was written in the Elizabethan Period which meant women were treated unfairly. Capulet\u2019s relationship with Juliet reflects how life was like in the Elizabethan Period. Women in the 1500\u2019s were clearly subordinate to the men meaning that they had complete power over everything. They were considered to be \u2018inferior\u2019 beings who were controlled by their husbands, fathers, or by any other men in the family. Life for women was one without any grand opportunities. They had no control over their own lives and their education was to learn how to be a domestic goddess meaning they would have to cook, clean and wash for the men. They had no voice in the society; it wouldn\u2019t matter to anyone because men were the primary figures in the society. Women were property of the men until they were married and they weren\u2019t allowed to hold their own views or lifestyle. This kind of society in the Elizabethan Era was called patriarchal suggesting that men were the leading figures making all the decisions about money, children, women, law and various social status decisions."
"The death penalty is a subject that has always been controversial. Although it is abolished in most of America. At the beginning of the story, grief was considered revenge, that is, the consequence of something unfair. This is widely used in the United States to have a more stable country. The death penalty as well said is to take the life of a person who, according to the judge, is guilty of a serious offense."
"The facial expression of the young woman is of alleviation, showing that she has a safe place for her and her child. The image is in some for a metaphor for the title, because it goes well together. The image connotates that the emotional consequences of violence can be extensive, this woman whether abused as an adult or a child, feels in some way responsible for what has happened to her. Perhaps this woman feels she is to blame, and is left believing she could have done something to avoid it. Perpetrators of violence sometimes use these feelings of self-blame, and even reinforce them, as a way of ensuring that their victims do not speak out."
"I was having panic attacks every day that left me feeling nauseous, tired, and in a constant state of worry about when the next panic attack would be. I was not able to take my SAT and thought all my hard work was for nothing. To get better mentally and physically I began to take medicine and started therapy. Both helped me tremendously."
"He also draws attention to the fact that some of the early abolitionists advocated the freedom of the black slaves for the same purpose of convenience, because they believed that white workers would be a better or more profitable option. The struggle caused by racial contention was therefore a complex and long process, in which idealism played a very small part. The actual battle took place between various political and economical interests. Nash also highlights that slavery actually increased its rate in the middle of emancipation again due to economical interests."
"They are both very nurturing for the infant and provide nutrients for the infant. Some even put breast milk in the bottles because it can be the best of both worlds. (Geddes, 2011) Comparing and contrasting breastfeeding and bottle feeding you can see the rewards and drawbacks for both of them. It\u2019s up to an individual to see what is best for their infant or child. Either way there are benefits no matter which way they chose to go. Breast feeding and bottle feeding will always be up for debate as long as people have different opinions about it."
"Gilho is somewhat skeptical about the situation and is confused by Wuseong. Later, Wuseong reveals that he has read Gilho\u2019s poetry, and that it \u201ccarved [him] out\u201d. This surprises Gilho, but instead of being happy, he is just ashamed. Perhaps he feels embarrassed that such a strange boy, someone so unconventional and different to him, would find value in his poetry. Another point of tension occurs when Wuseong tells Gilho that the goose is actually his mother. Gilho denies the possibility of this and Wuseong says, \u201cI\u2019m going to make you believe\u201d. Wuseong interprets Gilho\u2019s comments as an expression of care towards him, which makes Gilho\u2019s face heat up in a blush. This marks a turning point in the narrative where Gilho begins tacitly questioning his views about propriety and societal norms, and starts to slowly understand Wuseong\u2019s perspective on life."
"Political unrest causes her to be unable to visit her aunt for several years, and she makes numerous references to the political reform in China throughout the book. I think she does this because she feels that too little is known about the political situation in China at the time and what life was like for the millions of people, like herself, living in a constantly changing country in times of great uncertainty. Before I read \u2018Falling Leaves\u2019 I knew very little about the Chinese revolution and so I found that the references she makes very insightful, and I think that her motives for writing the book were to impart the message of what her life was like to a large number of people who were previously unaware."
"The problem of drought would be frequent. Consequently, malnutrition and starvation will pose serious challenge before humanity. Global warming is a great threat to the flora and fauna of the earth. A large number of species of them may become extinct. The expanse of desert would increase. Low rainfall and rising temperature could add to the intensity and frequency of dusty storm. This in turn will immensely affect the quality of agricultural land, ultimately causing adverse effect on agricultural produce. It would have far-reaching socio-economic impact. In Indian context, the impact of global warming is a matter of grave concern. As is well known, India is mainly an agricultural country and agriculture here is gamble of the monsoon, e.g. largely depending on rainfall."
"Links two words together Uses some adjectives (big, happy) Speaks clearly enough for parents to understand some of the words Begins to play make-believe Begins to sort objects by shape and colour Scribbles Finds hidden objects 2 \u2013 3 years Walks up and down stairs, alternating feet Kicks, climbs, runs and pedals a tricycle Builds a tower of nine or more blocks Manipulates small objects and turns book pages one at a time Imitates parents and playmates Takes turns Expresses affection openly Easily separates from parents Speaks 250 to 500 or more words Speaks in three-and four-word sentences"
"This is likewise the reason why people think on numerous components that can accelerate the advancement of this essential social relation. However, numerous authors likewise have their own beliefs as to how strong relationship can be developed. These views can help us formulate standard understanding on how strong friendship can actually be developed. What are the elements that build a strong friendship? First of these aspects is the aspect of having a friendly character."
"As documented above, ecotourism is vital for the economy, lifestyle and on going maintenance of wildlife in Kenya. What is required is a balanced approach to sustainability of ecotourism. Ecotourism in Kenya and in any location of the world should have minimum impact on the indigenous culture, a steady income stream and reduction on land degradation and wildlife destruction. The revenue of tourism should support the lives of the grass root people and enable them to have suitable standards of living. This will encourage their commitments to programs as they will see the benefits of their co-operation."
"#20. \u201cIn order to understand other societies, all college students should be required to spend at least one of their undergraduate years studying or working in a foreign country. \u201d I agree that collegiate student should spend a semester abroad. Although I think that students should be given the option to study abroad and not be required to, only because some will lack interest or not have the means to travel. Traveling to a foreign country and culture will give students great opportunities to experience other cultures and peoples."
"The crime problem goes way deeper than just guns. Criminals will find a way to get guns regardless if theres a strict law or not . Most criminals are opportunist and having a strict gun law only gives them the opportunity to commit more crime with less worry about that person being armed. I believe that there is other ways to fight crime, however, I don\u2019t believe gun control is the answer to making our world a safer place."
"Right off the bat, he said, \u201c I hope that one day, you think of me as your friend.\u201d And let me tell you, Morrie was a lot more than just a friend to me. He was my best friend, my confidant, my mentor, my coach. Morrie was like no one I\u2019d ever met before. He had a completely different view of life\u2026and death. He used to say, \u201clearn to die, and you\u2019ll learn to live."
"Born into a prosperous Midwestern family, Eliot attended Harvard and then went on to study at Oxford. Although born an American, Eliot married an Englishwoman, gave up his American citizenship, and lived most of his life in London. Eliot made his living as a teacher, a banker, and an influential literary critic. He popularized the modernist style of thinking and writing."
"You should have covered the following points in your answer: (1) The mother is not able to care for herself with the demands of a new baby. (2) She therefore needs health education and advice on how to handle the situation. 1. 6 Neuman\u2019s systems model/theory According to Neuman, her personal philosophy of helping each other live contributed to development of the holistic systems perspective of the her systems model. Neuman\u2019s theory is based on: * * the two main components of stress and the individual or his or her body\u2019s reaction to that stress the community\u2019s reaction to certain stress factors (stressors) in the environment"
"In particular, the board does not comprise of people of color. The company\u2019s chief executive officer is a Caucasian male. Women make up only 30 percent of the company\u2019s board of directors. The three women are: Judith McGrath, former MTV Networks\u2019 chief executive officer Jamie S. Gorelick, former United States deputy attorney and Patricia Stonesifer, former Gates Foundation executive. The male representatives in the company\u2019s board of directors consists of: Jeff Bezos, Tom Alberg, John Seely Brown, Daniel Huttenlocher, Jon Rubinstein, Thomas Ryder, and Wendell Weeks (SEC, 2018). Overall, Amazon\u2019s website might be helpful in recruitment of women and minorities as well as male Caucasians. This is based on the fact that the websites explain various diversity programs implemented by the organization to improve inclusion. Among the major elements contained in the company\u2019s website, it includes: hiring policies, the organization\u2019s inclusive culture, workforce data, affinity groups, plus empowerment of diverse entrepreneurs."
"The first negative downside is the possibility of saying goodbye to everyday, normal life (Prince, 2016). Famous children who have long hours of rehearsals and other activities have to give up leisure time with friends to honor their commitment to production (Mink, 2017). When other children spend their time playing and improving their skills, exceptional ones need time to practice due to the difficulties in the entertainment industry. Another factor taking their normal life away is the lack of privacy( Loftus, 2014)."
"The setting currently has children with Autism, global learning delay, speech and language disorders and chromosome 16 disorder as well as other children with undiagnosed additional needs. The Warnock report 2005 focuses on the future of education and inclusion into mainstream schools. The Warnock report changed the way that we see children with disabilities and encouraged inclusive education, however now inclusive education is favoured the SEN school system is become devalued despite the work they do for the children they care for. My setting is a inclusive setting for children with additional needs and we support the development of the\u00a0children and the preferences of the children."
"Yet the atmosphere of the play may render Malvolio\u2019s aspirations less unreasonable than they initially seem. The feast of Twelfth Night, from which the play takes its name, was a time when social hierarchies were turned upside down. That same spirit is alive in Illyria: indeed, Malvolio\u2019s antagonist, Maria, is able to increase her social standing by marrying Sir Toby. But it seems that Maria\u2019s success may be due to her willingness to accept and promote the anarchy that Sir Toby and the others embrace. This Twelfth Night spirit, then, seems to pass by Malvolio, who doesn\u2019t wholeheartedly embrace the upending of order and decorum but rather wants to blur class lines for himself alone."
"The Americans began to perceive the necessity of reform and abolition of slavery. The institution of slavery began to be considered as a sign of the lack of civilization and advancement on the part of the country. As Nash points out, at this time, awareness grew towards the series of moral, religious and social justifications for the abolition of slavery. In the first place, slavery was considered a debasing institution that functioned at the center of a democratic nation."
"Old age brings about numerous problems including physical, emotional, and functional disorders. (Butler & Lewis, 2003). Storrs (2008) describes old age as a biological change which causes diminishing powers of adjustment. This is evident when we see patients unable to cope with their surroundings. Some common physical changes in old age include decrease in cardiac output, increase in blood pressure, impairment of gas exchange, elevation of blood glucose, decline in lean body mass, and loss of muscle mass which makes an elderly person\u2019s locomotion difficult (Boss &\u00a0Seegmiller, 2001). Not only do changes occur physically, but the elderly also experience various mental alterations. Mental changes may occur following normal aging, medication side effects, and natural functional loss. (Woodward, 2004). Common mental impairments associated with old age include decline in memory retention, depression, and increased anxiety. (Woodward, 2004)."
"Minorities were then 25% of all prisoners while only about ten percent of the total population.The Kerner Commission warned in its report: \u201cOur nation is moving towards two societies, one black, one white-separate and unequal.Coramae Richey Mann, Unequal Justice, suggests that white Americans view the classic rapist as a \u201cblack man,\u201d the typical opium user as a \u201cyellow man,\u201d the archetypal knife wielder as a \u201cbrown man,\u201d the \u201cred man\u201d as a drunken Indian, and each of these people of color as collectively constituting the \u201ccrime problem\u201d."
"It can not be denied that fathers are very important in the family.\u00a0 Without a father there is no family.\u00a0 The absence of the father maybe associated with some undesirable behavior of the children.\u00a0 Among wihich are poor school performance,poor relationships with peer, problems with impulse control, rebellious and other adjustment difficulties."
"Roosevelt in my view had done a great job and we cannot really ask any more of him. He did as best a job he could, using his resources wisely, and in the end did what the majority of the population needed. So in conclusion after reading the sources and considering my own knowledge I have come to the conclusion that the first interpretation is right. Roosevelt did help many Americans and he did regain confidence amongst Americans which helped lift them out of the depression. The war was simply and aid to help America recover quicker."
"The children were taken from their homes and at the schools were not allowed to speak their own languages or practice any cultural or spiritual rituals. This was extremely effective as these schools made aboriginal children forget their culture and when they grew up they could not pass it on to their own children, as they themselves knew nothing other than the \u201cgreat Canadian way of life."

"The Southern Methodist University 1986 \u201cDeath Penalty\u201d was a fair punishment because during the season, SMU Athletic Boosters cheated the system by bribing the best players and having government figures getting involved, yet the effects of the death penalty raises speculation about whether SMU was guilty of receiving the death penalty. The Southern Methodist football team deserved the death penalty because of their athletic booster\u2019s use of bribery to recruit the best players in the nation. Southern Methodist University, a private university located in Dallas, Texas, is not one that many people hear of."
"Hilly didn\u2019t even notice until Minny said \u201ceat my shit\u201d. As tension rises between Hilly and Minny. Minny decides to participate in the book, talking about the daily life of the help, since she has nothing to lose. As an act of courageousness Minny puts herself in danger by cooperating on the book as she puts her daily life on paper. But in Jackson that is a punishable crime because it is considered a rights movement and it is frowned upon. Since the maids are tired of being mistreated by the whites and having unfair laws they are ready for change."
"The reason why they did was that they knew that the French couldn\u2019t afford the tickets to sit on the English and the rich side, and it would again make French inferior to the English. Also, the French could only speak English on the bench. Lord Durham also said that the French had no history or culture and also called illiterate which totally attacked the French culture. He also suggested making a program of education where French Canadians would become more progressive. This meant changing the French to English indirectly. This was really unfair to the people of the Lower Canada or French and it made them really angry."
"Racist tendencies have been strong in Britain since the arrival of significant number of immigrants after the Second World War. There are inadequacies between the white British people and members of ethnic minorities in Britain, considering employment, housing, income, and so forth. Back in the 1950s 1960s, 1970s and even 1980s, physical assaults on black Caribbean immigrants and other ethnic minorities were quite frequent. Not to claim that in the 1990s and onwards there have been no racially motivated attacks, only there have been fewer of them."
"While the divide on racial and fiscal issues has remained consistently wide for decades, seemingly indicating a wide social divide, African Americans tend to hold the same optimism and concern for America as Whites. In the case of many moral issues such as religion, and family values, African Americans tend to be more conservative than Whites. Another area where African Americans outstrip Whites in their conservatism is on the issue of homosexuality. Prominent leaders in the Black church have demonstrated against gay rights issues such as gay marriage."
"Lennie is like Candy\u2019s dog. He is even described by Steinbeck with animal-like qualities. His hands are described as \u201cpaws\u201d and he drinks water like a \u201chorse\u201d. Lennie\u2019s passion for animals makes him more animal-like as well. The death of the mouse, puppy, and Curly\u2019s wife all help to foreshadow the death of Lennie. When George finds out that Lennie has killed Curly\u2019s wife he knows that Curly will seek revenge."
"In some countries such as China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and North Korea where capital punishment is still prevalent, citizens are executed based on the crime and judges do not have the opportunity to consider the circumstances of the crime before passing judgment. Thus, according to the speaker, the death penalty is an irreversible and cruel form of punishment that should not be used in the United States. The main purpose of the talk is to convince the audience who are eligible to vote to raise and let their voices be heard by voting for the repeal of the death penalty in the upcoming popular vote in the State of California."
"The poem \u2018Nobody Calls me a Wog Anymore\u2019 is a passionate, fiery and forceful view of the Australian identity written from the perspective of the Greek imigrant Kimninos. The poem presents a multicultural image to Australia\u2019s identity in\u00a0highlighting a man fighting for acceptance and an identity in a land now known for its cultural diversity."
"This would include how a pregnancy would end. The Supreme Court also has recognized the interest of the states in protection potential life and has attempted to spell out the extent to which the states may regulate and even prohibit abortions. In Roe v. Wade, the United States Supreme Court held the Texas penal abortion law unconstitutional, stating this: \u201cState criminal abortion statutes\u2026that except from criminality only a lifesaving procedure on behalf of the mother, without regard to the stage of her pregnancy and other interests involved is violating the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (Pozgar, 2008)."
"Shakespeare is a shrewd dramatic engineer and in words of Joan Holmer he \u201cfashions an artistic unity out of the richly varied and often contradictory elements that constitute The Merchant of Venice\u201d. By creating, a difference between Venice and Belmont Shakespeare makes the play even more appealing and as readers, we sure can appreciate this."
"If these people were moving around they wouldn\u2019t be able to stay with their families/friends. Because of this, people got lonely because they were looking for jobs, so they wouldn\u2019t have any time for relationships, and as George says: \u201cwe ask no questions on the ranch\u201d which means that you keep your self to yourself. No-one knows who you are or where you\u2019ve come from, or what they\u2019re planning to do next. If you knew these things about a specific person (or any person), they would tell you off for nosing around."
"Most immigrant minority groups have some semblance of control over where they are immigrating to. For this reason, they usually keep enough of their culture and resources to help them achieve that which they strive for. While immigrants will face problems trying to assimilate, they usually have a better chance than those that have been colonized."
"At this time in history, most of the African Americans lived in the southern part of the United States of America and they were not at peace with the whites. There was tension between the African Americans and the whites at this period where even getting jobs was very hard for the African Americans. Most of the African Americans worked as tenant farmers or sharecroppers. Very few of them got jobs in the mills as the owners of the mills preferred to use white children and white women as they considered African Americans ignorant and lazy(Media Projects Incorporated 34)."
"However, through the lack of dialogue and personal relations the narrator has it is evident that, much like the bird, she struggles to connect to the people that surround her. This also lead to her ultimate down fall as is suggested by the change in tense at the very end of the story, \u2018Apart from a crumpled cigarette he was also holding a bicycle pump\u2026 This afternoon he is bound to come again. \u2019 The melancholic mood is created through signifying that the narrator continues to wait at the window and maybe for eternity suggests that she will never be able to have the connection she so longs to have."
"The impact of police brutality can vary depending on the situation but a typical impact is PTSD. Victims and their family can suffer from things like panic attacks, depression, substance abuse or generate suicidal thoughts. This does not mean a victim of police brutality will automatically develop PTSD but they have a better chance of it developing. Some cases of police brutality have received media attention and can even start movements. Three black activists established a social movement called Black Lives Matter. It started with a simple hashtag on Facebook, #blacklivesmatter. A Tumblr and Twitter account were created shortly after as a way for people to share their unheard experiences and stories to the public. The words \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 was used as a slogan on signs for protests and at marches."
"It\u2019s a one-minute advertisement featuring a recording of a 911 call. The lady on the phone sounds shaken and possibly scared. It is revealed later in the video that she was unable to tell the operator what the problem was because in the room with her. She pretends like she\u2019s just ordering a pizza and at first the operator is confused but he soon catches on to what she\u2019s doing and begins to help her. The imagery in this commercial shows that paintings have been removed from the wall and broken, the bed is unmade, and there is a hole punched into the wall."
"Without Self-Respect then people will think of other people as having no purpose and will mirror that towards the people around you. You have to make yourself something in this world or you will treat others badly, and disrespect them because you yourself feel as though you have no point to live. Like in the literary work, \u201cOn Self-Respect\u201d the author states, \u201cTo do without self-respect, on the other hand, is to be an unwilling audience of one to an interminable documentary that details one\u2019s failings, with real and imagined, with fresh footage spliced in every screening\u201d (Didion)."
"He desired power to the point where even his comrades became afraid of him (Washington). He was given the nickname \u201cThe Hangman of Europe\u201d for ruthlessly eliminating any and every form of rebellion in Germany (Tagart). He would continue to murder Jewish victims and anyone who could and would stop the NAZI until he has been stopped. He gets stopped by the loss of his life."
"They believe that where ever possible illness must be quickly dealt with in order for society to function effectively. In the instance of Aziz and Tamsela, the functionalists view contradicts their situation as they are in ill health and are not working; therefore they are stopping the effective function of society. In order to comply with the functionalists view they would need to seek help themselves and ensure their return to health in order to be able to start working and contributing to society as in their current situation they are draining society."
"James Baldwin\u2019s life was deeply marked by an identity battle. A battle to discover out what it suggested to be an American and foremost what it indicated to be an Afro American. Like in other works he likewise handles this subject in his very first unique Go Inform It on the Mountain, where John Grimes confronts this problem on his fourteenth birthday. The following paper will for that reason have a look at the possibilities used to the Afro American characters in the story, particularly to John, and what role the church plays in this context."
"Another stigma regarding adoption is that people always think that it is always second best to adapt than to take adoption as a first option, you can always take adoption as a first option and you might have saved an Einstein someone who will and save some of the world\u2019s problems."
"However this article motivates me to use cooperative learning groups to teach the children how to work together and respect for each other. These small groups can be set with children of various backgrounds and abilities to work on activities together. As they work together I will accomplish at least two things- help them to learn how to share and respect each other, and learn from my modeling as I interact with the groups.

"The last paragraph shows her achievments of her efforts and that she is still not happy. The first sentence describes how close she looks to the stereotype. She really is a symbol for beauty now. (\u201d \u2026 a turned up putty nose, dressed in a pink and white nightie\u201d) In her opinion everybody sees her as a beautiful woman now."
"How can these problems be addressed to achieve greater racial equality? In order to address the issue of education, our country must create a way to fund all schools equally. Although the federal government does give money to public schools across the country, schools in each district are mostly funded by the taxpayers living in that district through property taxes. This leads to a small amount of money that is dedicated to schools in poorer districts, and a larger amount of money dedicated to schools in richer districts."
"But Lord Justice Kay noted that 50 years ago a defense of provocation meant a \u201csudden and temporary loss of control.\u201d He asked how that could apply to Ellis, who carried her gun for 90 minutes before shooting. Mansfield said the question should have been left to the jury. David Perry, the lawyer acting for the Crown Prosecution Service, maintained there was no unfair trial on the basis of the law as it then existed. It was not a crime of passion, but a \u201ccalm, deliberate, premeditated killing,\u201d he said."
"In the period from 1500 to 1830, racial stereotypes were popular in the regions of Latin America/Caribbean and The United States And Canada and they had a significant effect on society, specifically societies with multiple ethnic cultures. The racial ideologies of these areas can be seen through the treatment of native peoples and the treatment of servants. Nevertheless, because of the strong influence of differing European countries, and their varying standards, contrasting social results can be seen."
"The NAACP fought for African Americans to have better treatment. The NAACP was created after the Springfield riot because they wanted to make sure that African Americans and other minority groups have the same rights as whites. Second, the NAACP had led up to greater things. The NAACP was a major part in the Civil Rights Movement with Martin Luther King as one of the leader \u201c NAAC: 100 years of History\u201d; leading African Americans through the Civil Rights movement taking them one step closer to integration."
"Donald Trump tweeted the following tweet on July 3, 2015, \u201cI love the Mexican people, but Mexico is not our friend. They\u2019re killing us at the border and they\u2019re killing us on jobs and trade. FIGHT!\u201d (Trump). In this tweet, Trump elaborates that people from Mexico, the illegal immigrants, are coming to the United States and are taking over jobs. Illegal immigrants make up most of the farm working jobs here in the United States. According to a cbs article, illegal immigrants only take up five percent of the United States workforce. If there were to be no more immigrants than that would mean there wouldn\u2019t be as much people working their jobs. Most Americans will unwilling take their jobs because of the hard work, long hours, and low wages."

"Murdock\u2019s description of the family is just one of many and I am going to discuss whether his idea of the family is representative of the family in today\u2019s society.

"to divert conflict or anxiety. Letter writing is used to improve the family connection and reduce levels of emotional reaction. Structural therapy focuses on reorganizing the family unit according to the roles and distribution of power among the members. The parents or caretakers of the home must work together as a unit and set boundaries for their children. The therapist strengthens sibling and adult relationships by making sure that no one person has more power than another family member. This kind of therapy allows some family members to stand behind a one-way glass so that the therapist can observe patterns of behavior between other family members. Systemic therapy focuses on the meaning behind family members\u2019 actions and behaviors."
"We study paintings to envision a different picture. We listen to music to whisk us away from the present. Within this art we also find what inspires us, what motivates us, and what we wish to emulate. Listening to different types of music, I personally find myself constantly enthralled by what rappers create. Typically stereotyped as low-cultured music because of what we hear on the radio, hip-hop has acquired a negative reputation. Artists such as Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar, and Lupe Fiasco are apart of a class of rappers pushing the envelope, bring hip-hop back to conscious ideas and themes. I strongly believe Kanye West is a positive role model for all people because of his commitment to discussing modern day issues, to inspiring fans through his lyrics, and to holding on to his individuality in a business that demands conformity."
"Immigration is changing our world, the reasons for migration are varied and may have economic, political or personal reasons. Poverty and war are regarded as common triggers for migration.

"This then allows for the determination of the behavior within the society as a whole. With the society sanction determined, conclusions can be made for the segregation of parts of the society. Depending on the outcome, parts of the society may need to be segregated to perform specific tasks. Doing this allows the family functions to stay balanced. If any one of these components become stressed, the family functions as a whole can be impacted and possible broken."

"Since social workers are the one who are in the \u201cfield\u201d they can also suggest better ways of conducting social welfare programs and they can also influence policy-making projects of the government and politicians.

"The author of \u2018Crackling Day\u2019 uses the cold weather to set the boys up as victims. They do not have many pieces of clothing on and the clothes they have on are do not protect them from the cold. In the text it says \u201cThere was a sharp bite to the morning air.\u201d This shows that the boys have little defences against the weather and are \u201chelpless victims of the bitter cold\u201d as they are also victims of racial prejudices. As the cold \u2018bit\u2019 into their bodies in the morning, the \u2018white man\u2019 forced the whip to \u2018bite\u2019 into the narrators back.

She doesn\u2019t punch her in the face but in the stomach, so as not to leave bruises. The fact that it was a little black girl, three years her junior, who beat her up meant that Lillian Jean could not go and tell her father, she was too proud.

"To conclude I think that there are always going to be good and bad role models but the good role models make the real difference. Young people would probably idolise and emulate the good role models more than they would the poor role models. Instead of being racist, a party animal, and a criminal. They\u2019d donate to charities, exercise, be anti-racist, help others and believe in them selves. To sum it up they would be better people. I do acknowledge the power of media/spot stars etc but I think most young people are becoming much more discerning and analytical to become celebrity copycats!"
"Amongst these nurses, there was one woman that had received the most honor, and that was Clara Barton. It was when she was a nurse on the sidelines, she achieved distinction among all woman. Her patience had run out, and she had gone out into the battlefield to tend to soldiers right where they had fallen. She had refused to wait for soldiers to be brought back to safer grounds, where they could die or become more wounded during the process. Barton\u2019s spirit to fight had grown immensely until she could not wait any longer and endure the pain the soldiers were feeling."
"\u201cSocial inequality is a more pressing socio-economic challenge than poverty in contemporary South Africa.\u201d South Africa is one of the most unequal countries in the world, but not the poorest (with reference to income). We can see that the inequality in South Africa has worsened over time by looking at the country\u2019s Gini Index score. In 1996 the score was 0.66 and in 2008, 0.70. The score has also deteriorated in terms of population groups: the score went from 0.54 to 0.62 between Blacks and from 0.43 to 0.50 between Whites (The World Bank, 2012). Countries such as Japan and Denmark have index scores around 0.25. The difference is quite visible. This essay will define poverty and inequality, discuss the measures and consequences of poverty and inequality, and discuss why inequality is a more pressing socio-economic challenge than poverty. Poverty can be defined as the failure to achieve certain basic capabilities and the inability to live a valued life. Basic capabilities include life, health, education, emotion and affiliation (Nussbaum, 1990:143)."
"I feel very blessed for having been raised. But this resulted also to some difficulties nowadays, in my adult life.

"The essay states that the greatest value of life is human life. But due to various reason and rights, people are devalued life on earth, since there are now different types of legal murders such as death penalty, euthanasia and abortion. Any kind of assassination infringes on the highest social value \u2013 human life. In this essay, attention is focused on the issue of abortion. Abortion is infanticide and is compared to the murder of an adult. Unfortunately, in some cases, abortions are necessary for the life and health of women, as well as to deprive children of physical or psychological pain in the future with different defects. Therefore, abortions should be legal only for medical reasons or as a result of sexual abuse. It is necessary to respect and fully protect human life from the moment of its conception."

The documentary contains many scientists\u2019 and environmentalists\u2019 opinion, to reassure the audience because we assume that everything experts say have got to be facts. Statistics such as graphs, which can be found on the DVD covers as well as in the documentary, provide evidence. This is reassuring to the audience because we assume that the statistics have not been manipulated. Both texts employ the same codes and convention, which is another form of intertextual link, in order to convince and reassure the audience."
"They needed to get away from the town they were formerly at due to the fact that Lennie had an occurrence with one of the females in the town. He was a rather big, frightening fellow. He went up to a young females due to the fact that the charm of her dressed marveled him. Just as he made with mice, he demanded touching it. That is all. Due to the fact that of her frightened screams, he grabbed onto the dress and did not let go out of fear and panic."
"If women reject any proposal by his husband than beating would be the only option, she is left with. Ghulam also beats his wife for her politeness and soft accent towards others. The girl punished just for being a separate identity and not being a part of her husband. The way she walked, the way she smiled at others, the tender look in her eyes as she patted the bullock, in his mind a doubt was born. For she remained a separate being, an individual in her own right, a stranger. Yes, a stranger, even though her body grew sweetly familiar. (44)Ghulam Qadir usually beats his bull because it was sharing love of his wife. He also hated his brother and nephew for the same reason. Faithless creature (47), he shouted at the poor animal.Even you have surrendered your soul into this She Devil\u2019s keeping. .. She\u2019s after my soul as well, he shouted. She wants to ensnare me as she has ensnared all the others. She Devil, She Devil, She Devil! (47)."
"The change is apparent from friend to foe as the same word is used in different ways to describe how the ocean is. In the first verse the poem reads, \u201cGlimmering and vast out in the tranquil bay.\u201d The vastness seems beautiful and safe as it is used in conjunction with words like \u201ctranquil\u201d."
"Therefore, the Aristotelian basis of civilization was historically strongly connected to the Middle Eastern and even Asian (Turk) civilizations (466). What actually occurred to lead to the development of civilization in Europe is based on an interplay of cultures from all over the continents of Africa and Eurasia. Such thinkers as Thomas Aquinas and Albertus Magnus relied heavily on the ideas that came from the Turkish-derived Aristotelian ideas (Dussel, 466). The ideas generated by Aristotle were actually studied in what is now modern-day Iraq (Baghdad) before Aquinas became exposed to them."
"He is considered a Freudian ego-psychologist; this means that he takes the foundation of Freud\u2019s theories, but turns away by focusing on social and cultural orientation instead of a sexual one. Erickson\u2019s theory closely ties personality growth with parental and societal values. Developmental Psychology Developmental Psychology is one field in Psychology that deals with behavioral changes and continuity from infancy to adult stage (Meyer 2001). A great deal of emphasis in psychology has been given to the child and to the deviant personality."
"No one believes themselves to be racists nor do they want to be considered racist. Racism is not as prevalent in today\u2019s society as it used to be, yet we fail to realize subtle racial biases that are held subconsciously in all our minds. In the movie Hidden Figures directed by Theodore Melfi in 2016, African-American women are discriminated against because of the skin color they are born with is not white. Through verbal and non-verbal language, their colleagues, who behave monstrously, discriminate against the women in ways that colleagues do not recognize."
"S Cost\u201d). Although illegal immigrants cause the United States to rise in debt, they could also help provide local economic boosts throughout the nation, by becoming United States citizens. This would cause a rise in tax revenue increasing funds for military, education, and money towards canceling out debt.\u201dCombining both citizens and immigrants together and allowing both parties to share resources could help the United States in the future\u201d (\u201cReuters\u201d). Children who are born in the United States and have foreign born parents without the certification of citizenship are known as anchor babies."
"Now, let\u2019s down to the earth. Indeed,death penalty cases are much more expensive than other criminal cases and cost more than imprisonment for life. Pre-trial motions, expert witness investigations, jury selection, and the necessity for two trials \u2014 one on guilt and one on sentencing \u2014 make capital cases extremely costly, even before the appeals process begins. Moreover, if a defendant is convicted but not given the death sentence, the state will still incur the costs of life imprisonment, in addition to the increased trial expenses. (Internet info) No doubt, this huge amount of money definitely will put a lot of pressure to the government, and citizens\u00a0have to pay more taxes to support the punishment, so why should government adopt the worthless death penalty as a punishment?"
"Generally, the Functionalist perspective looks at society as a complex system. Functionalists aim to focus on different contributions to social solidarity and stability. Orthodox Functionalism did not technically envelop critical analyses of race or ethnicity, going instead for perceiving race as another constituent element. This element, within the larger whole of society, that is assimilated into its harmonious and smooth functioning\u2019s. From this perspective, societies can be seen as finely tuned, interacting, and fundamentally relational constructs that function like organisms, with all different facets of the model are continuously, and unconsciously working towards social equilibrium. Given this repetitive emphasis on equilibrium and harmony, the Functionalist perspective easily allows for specific micro and macro analyses\u2019 of more explicit race-inspired issues such as hate crimes or social power discrepancies and general racial conflict. It allows for the microanalyses in that most of modern sociology is oriented around the individual and trying to identity formation of the socially constructed nature of race. It is much less well adapted to\u00a0understanding individual discrimination and prejudice because it ignores the inequalities that cause tension and conflict."
"The other half however is a blacked out city with planes and bombs. Anyone whose heart melted at the little children would certainly want to take them away from that dreary scene. Also the language used in the text is very persuasive using such things as \u201ckindly folk\u201d, \u201cgreatly helping\u201d and \u201ctake them out of a danger zone where desperate peril may come at any moment\u201d which would convince many people to foster such small innocent children and take them away from harm."
"36). Again this is cultural rather than racial. Any craftsmen, no matter what color his skin, can buy the tools of his trade to better his position. Rothenberg tends to be angry at this country\u2019s struggles against racism, class and gender. She has collected many angry essays to support her racial and feminist opinions but has not shown more than a minimal reference to how far this country has progressed for all races and genders to be \u201cWe the People of the United States\u201d (U."
"Reciprocity is the process of verbing someone. Being honest and trusted by others shows that he is an honorable and trustworthy person. For example, according to Haidt\u2019s TED Talk, individuals must treat others the way that they want to be treated, so they can change \u201cother people\u201d (Haidt 26). This proves that an honorable person will be kind and honest to others. He will treat others with respect and also treat others how he would want to be treated. In comparison, having honest and close friends are needed to feel important to others."
"We all depend on the health of our home planet. Preserving and protecting its health means the wise use of our natural resources, the restoration of the environment, which we spoil by our very existence: we deplete the soil, pollute the air and water. Most environmental crises arise from the fact that people interfere with normal natural processes, not understanding the danger that threatens them. Conservationists \u2013 environmentalists \u2013 divide all natural resources into two categories: those that cannot and those that can be restored. The first group includes coal, gas, oil, minerals, which, once spent, can not be refunded. They must be used wisely. The second includes forests, wild animals, water and land, which can be \u201crestored\u201d if you apply the correct methods of management. Love for nature and taking care of it begins with little: in the hike and in the camp, tidy up the garbage, watch the fire carefully, treat the trees carefully (do not cut them, do not cut the initials on the bark), teach others to love and appreciate God world. Scout laws teach you how to live in nature. But your other people\u2019s bad habits are your concern. Due to the inappropriate behavior of one or several people, irreparable damage may be caused to nature. When giving advice and making comments to others, be always polite and sensitive. Then you will always be a welcome guest and you will be greeted everywhere with the words \u201cWelcome!\u201d. After our project, I had a desire to push people to love and help nature."
"These outcomes together with the more than 40 substansive rights detailed in the The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)(Appendix 1), which Britain ratified to in December 1991, are a postive step in ensuring all children and young people are represented, protected and given a voice. The conventions\u2019 rights apply to all children and young people without discrimination and safeguard their basic needs and entitlements irrelvant of their culture, ability and nationality."
"Sharon\u2019s rebuke to \u201craid the fridge like a normal kid\u201d clearly shows that she considers Eng alien, possibly inferior. Eng\u2019s guarded stances to Jason\u2019s affection and hostility towards Sharon suggests possessiveness as well as mistrust towards the American ways. Jason is familiar with the western procedure of caring for an ill child; to tell stories and sit beside them until they fall asleep, which falls short with Eng\u2019s tantrums and . Sharon has correctly assessed that Eng has psychological issues, although it may stem from her dislike of the child. Jason himself wonders her smell about the unusual complexion of her bruises as an racial oddity, a thought that has undertones of superiority complex. Eng\u2019s belief in the \u2018money cure\u2019 ie, pressing coins or amulets onto injured bodies as an attempt to heal them; Jason witnessed it during his term in Vietnam, although he is oblivious to the reality that his daughter is practicing the same remedy, to little effect."
"With this mask on, the sender can trick some people into giving them very valuable information. This could be the password to an online banking account or a credit or debit card number. Sometimes these attacks will attempt to take control of your email or messaging account, to use your identity to trick your contacts into falling for the scheme as well. Essentially, phishing attacks are very simple attempts at tricking users into giving up sensitive information."
"A subaltern, according to the dictionary, is a person holding a subordinate position, originally a junior officer in the British army. But Spivak draws on the term\u2019s nuances. It has particularly rich connotations for the Indian subcontinent because the Anglo-Indian writer Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936) so often viewed imperialism from the ambivalent position of the\u2019 subaltern functionary in the complex colonial hierarchy, caught between detested superiors and feared \u201cnatives. \u201d The Italian Marxist theorist ANTONIO GRAMSCI later applied the term to the unorganized masses that must be politicized for the workers\u2019 revolution to succeed."
"Throughout this text, Stallworthy implicates a very negative atmosphere, relation directly to the bumpy relationship between father and son. A mood of intensity is depicted through the use of phrases such as, \u201cI curse tonight,\u201d, where the son expresses his frustration over the fact that while his father is at home, with him, he is busy working. Even though they may be physically near, the father\u2019s heart and mind do not stray from work. The tone is also often depressing or gloomy, which is highlighted by the fact that it is set during night time; this is when all fears are at their peak, and when one feels most lonely as well."
"Both An Inconvenient Truth and The Great Global Warming Swindle reflect the same social values. In our society, people value truth. One of the reasons as to why people would be interested to pick either one of the documentaries up will be that they are seeking truth in them, even if it is \u201cinconvenient\u201d, although convenience is the preferred."
"A multitude of times you will see this scenario described by this quote from College is not (and shouldn\u2019t) be for Everyone \u201cwe continue to push most of our young people through a single funnel called a four-year college education \u2014 a funnel so narrow it\u2019s causing applicants and their parents excessive stress and worry about \u201cgetting in;\u201d that\u2019s too often ill-suited and unnecessary, and far too expensive; and that can cause college dropouts to feel like a failure for the rest of their lives. This is just reiterating the fact that some people may be able to get into college but, some people might not even make it all the way through. This still comes with all the wasted time and money though, luckily for these people though they didn\u2019t waste as much as others."
"Not specific to baseball but in general life, many things were completely segregated as explained by Kim Pereira \u201cWilson used the fence and baseball to tell this story. It was not just a story of a life perceived as a failure, but a look into the minds and thoughts of an African American in the 1950\u2019s\u201d (Pereira 47). Very few people before the civil rights movements in the 1960\u2019s were acting out against racism, and many black people accepted this and began to believe that they were in fact, the inferior race. Troy cannot see the clear racial progress that has been made since he played baseball."
"Evidence of the effectiveness of firearms as a self-defense tool can be seen in numerous studies. For example, according to a study in 2000, an estimated 989,883 U.S. citizens used some form of gun to defend themselves (Agresti and Smith, 2). In addition, in 1993, 3.5% of households had used a firearm to defend themselves \u201cfor self-protection or for the protection of property at home, work, or elsewhere\u201d (Agresti and Smith, 3). These numbers put gun control in a much more positive light, especially from the perspective that they should be used to increase security in an increasingly insecure country. The best way to prevent shooting incidents like the Sandy Hook shooting is not to simply remove all guns, as that will not fix the underlying problem, but to focus on rehabilitating people who either have had violent tendencies in the past, or\u00a0exhibit symptoms that are consistent with mass shooters."
"In 1919, Johnson & Johnson began their first international expansion. The brothers first expanded into Canada and after an around the world trip in 1923 began to develop business in many more countries. They expanded into Australia in 1931, Sweden in 1956 and Japan in 1961 (Johnson & Johnson, 1997-2007). Over the next 60 years, Johnson & Johnson had established companies in over 50 countries."
"The sound was also particularly good because it gave more atmosphere when for example they were using voices in someone\u2019s head the voice seemed like it was coming from everywhere and not just one place which was more interesting. The music played also was more interesting and gave a good idea of the time setting. All the sound was recorded. If I could see the musicians they would not be pat of the play and would conventionally be part of an orchestra pit. There were no special stage effects used which would wow or amaze someone besides lights and sounds."
"According to the Journal of Politics and law, \u201cThe Birth Control Law of PRC restricts married, urban couples to having only one child, and rural couples to having 2 children if the first is female, while ethnic minorities are not restricted\u201d (Chen, B., 2012). She currently lives with a host family and enjoys playing with the family\u2019s children. She also states that the only family that she has in the U. S. are her uncle a few cousins that currently attend Madonna University. Ms. Mao states that most of East Asia populations are Mongolian, whom her people traditionally refer to as the yellow race. Later she says that she has been in the U. S. for 5 months. When asked what she recalled when she first recognized her ethnicity, she replied that most Chinese children know who and what they are at a very young age. She tells me that she learned English at 3 years old and that this is when her teachers and parents introduced her to the Han nationality."
"The themes in both of the poems are very similar also both poems are about mice and their life changing experiences with them. The common theme in Anna Barbauld\u2019s, \u201cA Mouse\u2019s Petition,\u201d is cruelty and unfairness. The mouse Barbauld speaks of is being used for tests in a science lab, and will eventually be killed in such experiments. Anna writes through poem that this act is unjust and should not happen to such a creature. Through the use of the poem she tries to tell the scientist \u201cBeware, lest in the worm you crush, a brother\u2019s soul you find.\u201d (Barbauld, l.35-36) Barbauld relates that killing a mouse is not morally different from taking the life of a fellow man. The poems theme is effective and pushes the reader to feel sorrow for the poor mouse. In \u201cTo a Mouse\u201d by Robert Burns, the ongoing themes are guilt and fear."
"Thus, should we still keep our faith in scientists\u2019 and researchers\u2019 ability to find a cure via animal testing? Should we still believe in those products which have made millions of rabbits blind? Should we still depend on and rely on such an inaccurate experimentation to cure our diseases? For me, the answer to these questions is \u2018No\u2019. It should also be the answer of yours, the answer of our humane society, the answer of our country, the answer of all the five continents and the answer of the entire world."
"If everyone who had racist tendencies or was being discriminated against took the course of action that Lawino did and tried to comprehend and understand the people they displayed racism toward or the people discriminating against them, instead throwing gasoline in the fire it could possibly help the situation. Lawino could be a good example for all people, Americans especially, while being ridiculous and discriminated against by her loved one Orcol, she still managed to not become a part of continuous world wind of racism."
"Schools may want students to join in extracurricular activities with the hopes to help said students \u201cbe a part of the school\u201d however said activities usual do not have an impact on the school, academically. Extracurriculars don\u2019t provide very many school related opportunities unless they are scholarship related such as sports or the fine arts."
"James then began to seek the origin of his parents in Suffolk, Virginia, and witnesses the poverty and racial complexities in that area intertwined with the early experiences of his mother in love, especially in the chapters The Promise, Old Man Shilsky and A Bird who flies (McBride, n. pag. ). The problems of the interracial marriage Ruth and Dennis, as well as the discovery of the synagogue is highlighted in the chapters A Jew Discovered and Dennis; while the final chapter, Finding Ruthie, emphasizes the fact that being a multiracial is not only difficult, but full of uncertainties (McBride, n. pag. )."
"home, pickled meat producer, or incarcerating criminals, society needs these services to thrive. In \u201cThe Last Stop,\u201d by Brian Cable the author visits a mortuary to overcome his fear of dead bodies. Similarly, in \u201cI\u2019m Not Leaving Until I Eat This Thing,\u201d written by John T. Edge, the main character is dreading having to eat pig lips to overcome his fear of their taste."
"Larry Sultan is an American photographer and produced a series of \u2018Home made\u2019 pictures of his mother and father in everyday life around their home. Larry challenged himself by visualizing and creating traditional photographs of his parents as an attempt to create a sense of identity to a traditional family photo album. Therefore he (Sultan, L. 1992, pg. 109) provided his mother and father with roles and \u201cstage directions\u201d of action and posture, all of which to his desire. Larry Sultan (1992) argues the control of the image by asking -\u201cA question of how you look and who determines that, who\u2019s in control of the image?\u201d (Sultan 1992, pg.113)."
"David Lammy said that parents should to decide what way their children are going. He meant it is very hard for some parents to discipline their children to stop them from mixing with the wrong people. He said that the state is not on a 15th floor block where there are drug dealer and other criminals. Children have to rule out what is wrong and what is right for them."
"In similarity to \u2018Pilate\u2019s Wife\u2019, \u2018Mrs Tiresias\u2019 uses hand imagery in order to present powerful ideas on masculinity and feminity in the poem. With the use of the ambiguous statement \u201chis hands, her hands, the clash of their sparking rings\u201d which on the one hand could be showing the rivalry between the new and old lovers, the use of \u2018clash\u2019 here could be Duffy\u2019s way of representing the battle of the sexes in the poem, and as the hands are described to be typically female, Duffy is able to show a man can never rival the status of a woman."
"Knowing that there are a huge number of good police officers oppose to the bad ones. Let\u2019s remember there are bad apples everywhere , even inside of a police department. We can allow the small mistakes to trump over the good. As you gained knowledge around police officers being accredited through trainings, tactics and mentors, how they keep us safe and most importantly how they impact people\u2019s lives unnoticeably. We must consider them as normal humans just liek you , take into consideration no one is perfect and people make mistakes every day. Remember next time you are pulled over, remain calm they are just doing their jobs, maybe they can relate to what you have going on."
"Religion is the most important in cultural society. In most of the culture the religion is very respectful to all of the culture members and they also strictly obey their religion. And the most respectful religion among all the culture is Islam. Those cultures that have Islam as religion they apply the order of Islam in their daily life and mostly these people led a very happy life without much resources. According to my survey a lot of my audience says that they follow their religion strictly and says five time prayers which is the most important thing as considered to Islam, and those audiences whose religion was other than Islam they mostly says that we are not so much following our religion."
"The fourth cse study for this portfolio project is one involving cyber stalking. Stalking has historically been an issue, it is usually done by physically following someone however, with the availability of information on the internet you can now stalk people online. In this case study, Cassandra Cruz who was an online school student became fixated on a woman she found on a porn website. Although it had been 15 years since this woman was actively posting porn, Cassandra was relentless with her growing obsession for the actress. She had access to two of the victim\u2019s news feeds for social media by portraying an attractive marine named Giovanni. Soon she began to post on every picture as well as her friends and families social media posts which raised suspicions with the victim. Giovanni was soon blocked from accessing the victim\u2019s social media and that\u2019s when Cassandra started email, call, and letter threats. Summarized by the Federal Bureau of Investigations News (2017) \u201cFrom the beginning of 2016 until late April, the victim received more than 900 phone calls and text messages on her cell phone alone. Approximately the same amount of unwanted calls were made to the victim\u2019s home and work phones before the FBI ended the stalking.\u201d Cassandra Cruz was good at what she did as she had several fake social media accounts and deceived the FBI for months in an ongoing investigation. Finally, Cassandra was caught in a video chat that confirmed she was the stalker as well as discussing $100,000 extortion demand from the victim. The FBI officially took her down at the meet-up for this supposed $100,000 demand. One thing to note from the article on the case is that even on her way to jail she was completely fixated and infatuated with this random victim, which goes to show virtually anyone can be a cyber stalker. However, the numbers do not lie released by the U.S. Department of Justice only 23% of stalkers identified by females were strangers, which is why it is equally important in the age of information to secure private credentials and do not overshare on social media, even with people you \u201cknow\u201d."
"They have been able to colonize themselves into American very comfortably over time. Cuban Americans are the third largest Hispanic groups in the United States. Cuban Americans have adapted well in the United States. In 2000, there were 17. 3% of Cuban Americans living below the poverty level. The median family income was $39,432. This is $15,474 less than Non-Hispanic White group. The unemployment rate was 5. 8% for the Cuban Americans. Cuban Americans religion is mostly Roman Catholic. Religion is not one of the most important roles to Cuban Americans as it is for the other Hispanic groups."
"Othello\u2019s trust in his friend Cassio was like a thin thread. It was very easy for Iago to succeed in his evil plans, for there was a lack of trust in their friendship. Iago manipulates Othello into believing that his honest wife Desdemona is having an affair with the loyal lieutenant Cassio. Although Iago gives no form of physical evidence, his convincing words are strong enough to allow such intense thoughts to enter Othello\u2019s mind."
"Optimism is necessary it has always been necessary if you\u2019re not optimistic then you will always be miserable, being positive is good for the mind and body being negative is not 48% of people are more than likely to die from severe stress or depression. If you\u2019re an optimist you will see opportunity in every difficulty."
"Biko would be beaten to death in the prisons because it is behind closed doors where the world couldn\u2019t see him and it could be framed as a suicide attempt. The mis\u2019 en scene which foreshadows Biko\u2019s death at the hands of the security police conveys the full horror which comes from challenging those who hold power in a society which is determined to keep its power. A long shot of a lit corridor reveals two police officers making their way to the cells where political prisoners are beaten and tortured, they descend into darkness. The low key lighting casts shadow symbolising a lack of hope for those in these cells."
"I think the earlier that we get children and families focused on their children and their role in the child\u2019s life as their teacher the better off we all are. Hiring bilingual staff may be one option on preserving the child\u2019s native language and to ensure that information is shared in a timely manner. Ensure that staff is aware of cultural issues and differences provide an opportunity for staff to learn another language to communicate with the families."
"My ivory, oh yes, I heard him, My intended, my ivory, my station, my river (Conrad 187), because every person in the village gave all his ivory to Kurtz. It describes how Mr. Kurtz thought about himself as if he had all the power and he was the owner of everything around him. Moreover, no one in Congo would compete him in the ivory business because he had killed almost every person who said no to him for ivory. He\u2019s very possessive for ivory, even when he\u2019s dying of illness, still, he was saying to save the ivory. His possession of ivory can be well-determined as, \u201cIn this country, you will not find ivory whether on the ground or underground because no matter how deep the ivory buried, only genius Kurtz knows how to find them\u201d (Shetty 474). So, it shows Kurtz\u2019s curiosity for ivory and to get that, he ready to do anything and everything as described above."
"Many of those people became non-trustful of any individual new to town, or those that threaten their community social standards. People, in many cases, imagined threats that did not exist. Also, many people became extremely possessive of what little they had. During the late 1930s, California was struggling not only with the economic problems of the Great Depression, but also with severe labor strife. By the late 1930s there were an estimaled 200,000 to 350,000 migrants: underpaid, underfed, and underemployed."
"To elaborate Cameron knew that if he intervened with Officer John he would be arrested and be all over the news. He was more concerned with his own image than his wife, which is why he stood there helplessly watching. Once the officers left, we can see that Cameron has been morally degraded and on the verge of succumbing into insanity. Christine starts to blame Cameron for his cowardly actions, although he does not seem to care much on the outside we can depict that it is doing a number on him mentally."
"In the book \u201c Cultural relation and State Building \u201d Malini Ratnasingam claim that the national individuality is the best signifier of individuality should accommodate by the Malaysian, beacause the other societal individuality content excessively much class that will rupture the Malaysian into many single pieces, but national individuality will work good for the Malayan, Because state are crossed by those differences, a force of unite, a sense of belonging and nationess."
"I agree with Malcolm X hustle throughout the autobiography. While Malcolm is giving up drinking, cigarettes, and violence while in jail, his background as an after-prison evangelist is close to his previous experience as a hustler. From his years as a hustler, Malcolm maintains experiences, skills and beliefs that support him as a spiritual leader and media personality in his later career. Malcolm\u2019s talents are used as a hustler and then as an advocate not being established with these future roles in mind, but rather focused on the required life skills that Malcolm acquired at an early age, stressing that life is a matter of life or death for the urban black person. Although the young life of Malcolm is very different from his adult life, at both stages of his life, his ability to fight for survival in the racist culture of America is equally important."
"Although Uncle Sam is not violent or imposing in this cartoon, his expression reflects sternness and forcefulness, showing his urgency to incorporate black labor into the war industry with a non-violent, practical approach. In addition to the use of his characters, Seuss uses text in order to convince his audience of his ideals regarding racism in the war efforts. The quote near the top of the cartoon states that \u201creal harmony\u201d can only be achieved by using both white and black labor in the war efforts. Not only does Uncle Sam advocate for equality, but he also wants to see the success of the war industry. He uses this appeal in order to address the desires of the wealthy class. By using the word \u201charmony\u201d, he means both racial equality in society, as well as improvements in the war industry. The white keys on the piano are labelled \u201cWhite Labor\u201d which far outnumber the black keys."
"The Klan, on behalf of its reasoning that the \u201cNegro\u201d, lazy, versatile, incapable of economy, is by its nature devoted to slavery, attacks blacks. This is the case of Perry Jeffers, who lives with his wife and seven sons on a plantation in Georgia as a tenant farmer. He enjoys an excellent reputation with his boss. Anyway, the Klan decides to make him pay for his success. One of the Jeffers sons retaliated to the attack: a dead man on the Klan side. In Jeffers\u2019 absence, the \u201cknights\u201d of the Klan returned in force, hung his wife and shot and burned his youngest child at a high pyre with the furniture of his house. Fortunately, the wife was saved at the last minute by Dr. Darden, who was killed by the Klan. Panicked, Jeffers tried to escape and took the train with his sons, but his wagon was stormed by klanists, who made them get off at the last stop in Georgia. A few hours later, their bodies were found riddled with bullets. In the history of the Klan, there are hundreds of such murders."
"Country Australia is paying a high price for immigration. At the same time as the government cries, \u201cpoor\u201d, and removes country services such as hospitals, post offices, schools, police and railways ect., they bring into Australia 120,000 migrants per year and provides them with all the services in the cities. You lose your post office and railways and migrants get jobs in post offices and on railways! Immigration costs Australia $15 billion annually. Just imagine the services which could be provided if this $15 billion were spent in rural areas. Electorally, one year\u2019s migrant intake is now more important to our politicians than rural Australia which has provided most of Australia\u2019s export income for 200 years. Most countries look after their export earners, but our government ignores, denigrates and exploits ours!"
"Prosecutor reveals that abusers are usually controlling people who enjoy taking control of the other person\u2019s life and they will go to any extreme to gain it. Furthermore, Prosecutor also explains, \u201cabuse is a relationship is any act used to gain power and control over another person. Women who are abused physically are often isolated and experience depression.\u201d In this example, Prosecutor addresses the detrimental effect of abuse and the increasing rates of depression found in the women of today. Domestic Violence is not only a human rights issue in the United States, it is a problem in other countries as well. For instance, domestic abuse has been ignored in the caribbean islands such as Jamaica. In a case where a wife killed her abusive husband, in her defence she pleaded being affected by\u201c battered wife syndrome (\u201cBattered Women \u201c)."
"This required very effective communication as the parents had to know that there were issues that needed addressing, how the issues needed to be addressed and that if there were any relevant underlying problems or concerns that they knew about, the parents could, with confidence, tell the teacher, so that the concerns could be taken into account and helpful advice or referrals to other professional bodies could be arranged if necessary."
"Another noticeable element in the film is Maniyan (Nandu) a very low-income plumber who also is a raging alcoholic, though he can afford only the cheapest stuff available through government retail outlets (Beverage). He regularly beats his wife Pankajam (Kalpana) who is also Raghu\u2019s domestic help. Maniyan is so addicted to alcohol, even worse than Raghu himself that he cannot distinguish from what is real and not. He creates a profound impact on Raghu. As the movie progresses, a couple of incidents happen in Raghu\u2019s life and surroundings which forms the remaining part of the movie."
"Many people claim that the importance friendship is checked in the time of somebody\u2019s success or triumph. We have an inclination to be envious, just some of us can suppress this negative emotion while others don\u2019t hide it at all. Friend is someone you can trust with your happiness. If he or she cannot share this positive moment of your life, maybe, it is not a good companion."
"Sibling Development; Implications For Mental Health Practitioners?Conflicts between siblings leads to \u201cvarious positive skills including perspective taking, turn taking, negotiation, persuasion and compromise\u201d (Caspi, 2011).?Sibling relationship may be a \u201cpowerful learning environment\u201d . This is because \u201cin comparison to peers, older siblings gave more guidance and positive feedback to younger siblings\u201d and they \u201cpaid greater attention\u201dto it. (Caspi, 2011)."
"By relaying the stories of children who have been through traumatic events in the facility, as well as her own personal experience interviewing them and visiting the school, Gonnerman creates a very emotional piece. After reading it myself, tears nearly ran down my cheek; and I\u2019m a man who rarely tears. Surprisingly, most of the article is factual, with some informative narrative. The voice of Gonnerman is present, as are her thoughts and opinions, but they are not stated outright."
"The other characters, including Monica herself, continue to obsess over their weight and poke fun at Monica\u2019s overweight phase with retrospect to her love for candy, her attendance in Fat Camp, or the idea that her weight contributes to her virginity. For example, in episode fourteen of the second season we watch as all six characters lounge around and watch a home video of a young Monica and Rachel getting ready for the prom. Within the home video, we see Monica eating a sandwich while waiting for her prom date."
"Actively working to learn more about the different cultural backgrounds of the children they serve and hiring staff with similar cultural and language backgrounds as the children in the program would be other implementable actions (Halgunseth et al., 2009, p.9). If the teachers are encouraged to interact in the community, there is a possibility of positive results (Halgunseth et al., 2009, p.9). A collaborative effort from all parties is needed during these times. If the community and the teachers are able to get together and connect, the connection will foster a positive future for students."
"Hassan is a Hazara and Amir is a Pashtun. For this reason the Afghan society has classified Hassan as a lower human being and he, along with his father, is in servitude towards Amir and his family. Amir\u2019s lack of self-confidence throughout the novel hinders his ability to have a true friendship with Hassan. Eventually Amir tries to break away from the power of the jealousy and guilt that Hassan has brought into his life."
"I think the important event of racism in the world is the \u2018History of Slavery\u2019. If we talk about \u2018Slavery\u2019, the first country we know is America . Actually , the number of African American slaves grew slowly at first , but then become an essential to the economy at the 1680s . The racism problem is a serious problem in America during the 17th and 18th centuries . During 17th and 18th centuries , there are slave trade in America , between 600,000 and 650,000 Africans had forced to travel to North America become slave ."
"If not as a cop then to work as hard as I did in whatever that \u201ctug\u201d is for him and to conquer his dreams. This is why it is time for me to stop dreaming and start doing. I feel like I have what it takes physically and mentally to be a valuable asset to the police force. If and when I\u2019m given the chance to show how serious this is to me, one will see how qualified I am to be able to call myself a police officer, someone that serves and protects his community. Thank you for your time and consideration."
"One main concern that the Border Patrol comes across is drugs being smuggled into America and our government will not tolerate that at all. Any walker that has bad intentions and brings that nonsense across the border with them should not be allowed in the United States. Therefore coming to America should be both legal verse illegal for different reasons. As long as border patrol is doing there jobs, they should be able to distinguish the two, make a separation and not confuse the two. Wait, but what exactly is Border Patrol? Is it actually just patrolling the border? Is there job only to catch bad guys? In the Devils Highway, Urrea sometimes makes it seem like Border Patrol along with the Coyotes."
"This study focuses on single parents and is designed to know the relationship between resilience and happiness among single parents. This study also desires to recognize the extent of happiness and resilience of the single parents; therefore, in order to do that, the researchers formulated two hypotheses: (1) Ho: There is no significant correlation between happiness and resilience among single parents and (2) Ha: There is a significant correlation between happiness and resilience among single parents. Through these hypotheses, the researchers will be able to identify if there is a correlation between the two variables."
"Black Psychological Association eventually introduce a woman leader in 1976, Dr. King was the first female president-elect for this organization (Holiday, 2009). Next, in 1970 the first article was written in the area of Black psychology, of which was the first broadly circulated publications. Furthermore, in 1974 the Journal of Black Psychology was established by the Black Psychological Associations (Holiday, 2009). The journal\u2019s aim was to continue the publication of scholarly psychological works that understand the experience of Black populations. Eventually, Black Psychological Association organized its first international meetings in Ocho Rios, Jamaica."
"It is of import to speak about the relationship between individuality and immigrant integrating into a society. The relationship is clearly shown in in Portes and Rumbaut \u2018s longitudinal survey. This survey used 2nd coevals migrators \u2018 self-identification labels as an index of how incorporate they felt themselves to be i.e. how much they identified with American civilization and how much they identified with their parents \u2018 civilization. The self-identities were linked to assorted manners of socialization, for illustration the individuality of \u201c American \u201d was linked to an assimilated individuality, whereas identifying by parents \u2018 national beginning, for illustration \u201c Filipino \u201d was linked to a possible reactive individuality. ( Portes and Rumbaut, 160 ) . Identities are influence by many factors including state of parents \u2018 beginning, gender, economic position, household construction, linguistic communication, phenotype, race, ethnicity, self-esteem and experiences of favoritism. ( Portes and Rumbaut, 147 \u2013 191 ) . This is non an thorough list of the factors that Portes and Rumbaut give for impacting individuality and individuality formation, but as discussed subsequently in my paper, it has been criticised for losing out some of import factors, and hence for non recognizing the complexness of individuality."
"Ahead of the Gem-Aten is the entrance to a long narrow court with a raised altar, beyond this alter is then entrance to another court, followed by a second and finally into three smaller sanctuary or garden courts. Each court of the temple, aside from the Gem-Aten had its own altar and colossal statues of Akhenaten as well as representations of the Aten on wall reliefs. There was no exit at the other end of The Great Temple so the procession of Akhenaten, Nefertiti and the Aten priests had to turn around and exit through the west entrance."
"An alarming statistic tells us that \u2018Britain boasts the highest rates of teenage pregnancy in Europe\u2019 (Davis, 2000, p1), and as Baroness Young complains (as cited in Davis, 2000) that \u2018marriage is hardly mentioned, it is all about sex and relationships\u2019 (p1). A higher social acceptance of homosexual relationships means that more people are partaking in these sorts of relationships freely, and this has been enforced with the introduction of The Civil Partnership Bill that allows homosexual \u2018marriages\u2019, and gay couples are now allowed to adopt children and form their own \u2018family\u2019 (www. thicsforschools. org, 2006)."
"Another affect of global warming is the shrinking of ice sheets. Specifically, the Greenland and Atarctic ice sheets are decreasing in mass at an accelerated rate. Greenland which lost 150 to 250 cubic kilometers of ice per year between 2002 and 2006, and to Antarctica, which lost about 152 cubic kilometers of ice between 2002 and 2005 (NASA, 2016) This proves how global warming is a increasing problem in recent years. Not only does it show an uncertain future for animals that inhabit those ice sheets, but for humans as well since, higher ocean levels means certain masses of land will be engulfed by water."
"Bill refers to Nancy as a \u2018She Devil\u2019. In her dying moments she shows her innocent side by praying, by \u2018on her knees and \u2018as high towards heaven as her feeble strength.\u2019 The reader gets a sense of goodness against evilness. The reader again sympathises with Nancy as she is murdered while Dickens emphasises Sikes evil ways. Bill Sikes runs away from the scene of the crime which shows that ultimately he is a coward, and his conscience finally dawns on him. After Nancy\u2019s death Dickens uses superlatives to show the reader how cruel Sikes crime is, he uses powerful words like \u2018worst\u2019, \u2018foulest\u2019 and \u2018most cruel\u2019. Bullying is again highlighted throughout this section. Here though, Dickens has highlighted a different type of bullying. It is immediate bullying that is used. Sikes performed a nasty and brutal murder."
"The more frills a product comes with, the more it may heighten the desire for it. Price was the third parameter that was chosen. Price was chosen because for many consumers price is one of the most important factors in making a buying decision. Finding the right balance between how much is too much and how low is too low is crucial in determining the appropriate price tag to entice consumer interest. The forth parameter chosen was quality engineering. Engineering was chosen because of the fact that the Cruiser Thorr will not be able to maintain a high brand image without this feature (University of Phoenix, 2011)."
"This is analyzed by the way he does his presentation. He performs his presentation in front of a live audience, an audience who is diverse. Diverse in the way that he has presented this slide show in many diverse places such as Aspen, Portland, London, Vienna, Italy, Spain, China, and South Korea just to name a few, and with males and females of every age. Gore also presents this slide show to people who want to know more about the situation. Which in return, we can assume that if the audience is attending his presentation, then they have little or no knowledge about the situation at hand and it is highly likely that they have not done much of anything in order to prevent global warming from becoming a future dilemma."
"Other studies have suggested that the standards agenda and inclusion can in some cases be complimentary, with attainment targets and accountability being seen as a driving force for inclusion (Dyson & Gallannaugh, 2007). In a target school they studied, achievement was seen as a priority with inclusion representing a way to achieve this. Here achievement targets were viewed as a way of assessing and identifying areas of weakness and marginalised students, allowing more focused remedial actions to be deployed."
"Kids admire their parents; they are constantly learning from them, admiration is something that moves them to even imitate their body language as well as their words. According to Dr. Salvador Sanchinelli, specialist on children\u2019s behavior, kids imitate their parents unconsciously and as a necessity. When kids have a doubt they would go and ask \u201cdaddy\u201d or \u201cmummy\u201d so the little one would trust their answer and take it as a fact."
"The effect Syed Qutb was both positive and negative positive in the fact that he tried to affect the lives of Muslims by supporting social and cultural change and showed a clear dissatisfaction with the status quo and encouraged change and by doing so attempted to guide Muslims in an ever-changing world. He had quite a negative impact in the fact that groups such as al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood have used his writings to justify military attacks and the way his writings have been interpreted have led to a world that is in a sense enveloped in terror and the use of military attacks is increasing now because of that there is a negative perception of Islam particularly within the Western society. However, the important point is that although terrorist actions have been closely linked with Qutb\u2019s writing, and terrorists use violence against civilians but Qutb actually never promoted violence against people or innocent civilians."
"My drive and passion for culinary art dated back to my early years, I would stay in the kitchen with my mum wanting to know how and why she was using all the ingredients, I started cooking at the age of thirteen and I have grown with time to develop a flair for food and anything that has to do with the kitchen. Cooking became a part and parcel of me, that part of my hobbies I love most and I do well."
"In \u201cTwo Hands\u201d, there are two main characters present: the son, who also narrates the text, and his father. The reader can depict the father to be a surgeon, or at least have a profession in the field of medicine, because of the use of terms such as \u201cscalpel\u201d or \u201clancet\u201d, as well as expression like \u201cfingers that have stitched new life\u201d. In contrast, the same \u2018two hands\u2019 of the son have been utilized in a rather contrasting way; that of the field of literature."
"In conclusion, the use of harsh discipline has many negative affects on a child. From aggression to anxiety, and even later use of abused substances, harsh discipline will have affected a child in some adverse way. Higher use of discipline is found most in homes of low income families and also of parents with little education. Parents who resort to physical or psychological discipline will not have a good relationship with their child because they will not find comfort in the person causing them harm. This will eventually lead to antisocial behaviors. The three forms of discipline: authoritarian, permissive, and authoritative, all have different affects on a child\u2019s behavior. The authoritarian and the permissive styles both will end up causing psychological and behavioral problems, and the authoritarian style in particular will lead to more child aggression and non-compliance. This is the case because the child learns from the parent that it is ok to be physical when upset. The authoritative style of parenting is most effective because it tends to a child\u2019s emotional needs while still setting limits and consistently enforcing boundaries. With this approach of parenting, kids were reported to have less internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. A limitation of this research when recording the correlation between physical discipline and externalizing problems was the fact that there was no discernment between physical discipline and physical abuse (Lansford et al., 2004). In the future, it would be more beneficial to have research geared more towards the child\u2019s inputs and opinions because they have the best insight to what is happening within themselves."
"Coronation Street\u2019s culture was also popular as it illustrated Hoggarts account on the \u201cemphasis on home, everyday, common sense and the lives of women. \u201c(21) The communal gatherings in social locations, such as the pub and cafi?? initiated this. According to Verina Glaessener , one of the most appealing characteristics of Coronation Street is its \u201cprivileging of the social and communal over the familial. \u201d (22)Here the characters \u201cfocus more on community rather then family relationships\u201d(23) and this is what marks its appeal as it illustrates regional identity that the viewers can identify with."
"Historically, political satire has been a popular genre used to address pressing social and legislative issues through a comedic artistic lens. From cartoons to short stories, political satire has addressed events ranging from the American Revolution in the 1700\u2019s to the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960\u2019s. A prime example of political satire is the play \u2018Los Vendidos\u2019 by Luis Valdez. \u2018Los Vendidos\u2019 sarcastically addresses racism in the 1960\u2019s by portraying the most common stereotypes of Mexican Americans in California. Luis Valdez, a migrant California farm worker in the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s, playfully approaches political agendas and cultural ailments in the play."
"Family is the building block of society. It is the most basic social group in any society. How members in one family relate to each other affects their lives, their work, and their friends. Groups of families that interact with each other, relate to each other and work together build a larger society. A family in sociology is a group of people who are legally, biologically, and/or emotionally tied. The model of a family we see most often is the nuclear family which constitutes a married heterosexual couple living together with their children; usually, the mom is attending for the kids\u2019 needs and the household and the father is the bread-winner, providing food and money for the family."
"In the opening scenes of the novel, Bigger and his brother, Buddy, try and successfully kill a rat. The rat is just as afraid of Bigger as Bigger is of the rat, and their reactions to these fears are the same: defiance and violence. The rat acted in violence in retaliation against Bigger because the fear it had of him. The rat \u201cleaped at Bigger\u2019s trouser-leg and snagged it in his teeth\u201d(Wright 5) as an attack towards Bigger."
"From what teenagers have read about being a teen parent it isn\u2019t as great as it sounds. No one wants to become a parent when they are a teenager. Teenagers are not able to get a decent education, and some teens don\u2019t know what they want to do with their lives. Teens don\u2019t want to stay home and take care of a child. There are many things teen mothers can do to help couples who have waited a long time to have a child, but could not conceive. A teen mother that isn\u2019t ready and a woman who has waited awhile to have a child would be more prepared. Yes, a baby is really cute and all, but teenagers really need to think about what they are getting themselves into. There are many of things that teenagers have to give up one is by having a child at a young age, when they are a child themselves. Teens wouldn\u2019t want to give up anything to take care of child. Teens should think about what they are doing before they accidently become teenage mother."
"Social attitudes towards children started to essentially change with the introduction of the Factory Acts (1819) which released children from mines and factories and the introduction of mass education in 1870. Better standards of living and nutrition also lead to decreasing infant mortality rate. Such changes didn\u2019t necessarily result in a more child-centred society. The state\u2019s decision to ban children from mines and educate them had more to do with need to increase the capability of the workforce by making them more numerate and literate."
"The word \u201cfriend\u201d seems to be used today to refer to anyone from long-term to short-term relationship; however a true friend is someone who will always be there in times of need, who will always be the best company, and who will always listen and give advice. Without any questions asked, a good friend will always be there in times of need. No matter how bad a problem is, a true friend will be the person who sits up nights and take days off work just to sit with a friend."
"Counseling advocacy refers to promoting counseling as a career. Such advocacy is significant due to the dependency of counseling profession on public perception of counselors as being able to educate, provide, research and help their clients (c.ymcdn.com, n.d). Sweeney, 1998 and 1999, as cited by (c.ymcdn.com, n.d) identified six advocacy themes; market place recognition, counselor education, inter-professional issues, research, intra professional relations, and client awareness. Advocacy is a challenging concept due to absence of set of instructions concerning where and how to commence and what entails effectiveness."
"And finally if a gun is deemed unable to be registered this restricts an individual\u2019s ability to bear that specific arm. Previously in the similar case of District of Columbia v. Heller the Supreme Court ruled that the second amendment did indeed protect individuals, as long as they were on or in federal property within the state."
"As an example, in nowadays if a wife finds out a husband has someone is cheating on her wife they will throw out their husband straight away however in this relation here she knows it by heart that he loves her but at the same time she loves him by through it all out. Overall their relationship is loving but their a twist caused by Abegail and that leads it to a different way."
"Single parents often must take on more hours at work to meet financial responsibilities, which can lead to children feeling neglected and acting out, and cause them to experience the effects of economic instability mentioned above. However, according to Priscila Comino, a researcher at the University of the Basque Country, it is not the divorce itself that affects children\u2019s behavior so much as it is the way that parents handle the divorce. In cases where both parents mutually decided on the divorce and choose to co-parent, both making decisions and providing for the child, the negative effects of divorce are lessened."
"South Korea has become a leader in Information and Communication Technology (CIT) particularly in the areas of high-speed South Korea 14 strength in CIT are a result of evolving global economy, policies created by governments to facilitate progress and the South Korean government\u2019s initiative to improve and invest in human and technological infrastructures. In addition, as a result of the aforementioned, competitive tactics evolved to increase efficiency and a personal norm of belongingness (Lee, 2003). The internet also serves the Korean Politicians. It has become an important communication management tool for their campaigns. The direct connection to their constituents allows them to maintain good relations and influence their support during an election campaign (Chine-long,2012). The Korean education system is growing at a rapid pace as the globalization efforts continue in other aspects of South Korean expansion plans."
"There is still institutional racism where it makes it difficult for people of color to advance. For example, people of color are underrepresented in the U.S. Congress, on Wall Street, and in leading large companies and organizations. To reach this ultimate goal of equal opportunity, people must be able recognize their own prejudices. Many individuals subconsciously have prejudices against others who are different from them in some way. Once people can acknowledge their own prejudices, only then can a society began to change people\u2019s hearts and minds."
"In my opinion, \u201cFriend\u201d is really important for me. I can live without computer and TV but I can\u2019t live without \u201dfriend\u201d the person who is sharing my mood with me whenever I\u2019m happy or sad and I have \u201cher\u201d my really best friend who has nice appearance , good personality and I\u2019m very happy that I can be friend with her. My best friend is My Mother. She\u2019s cute, good looking and does not talk too much with the person that she doesn\u2019t know very well."
"A child will not be excluded directly but will be unable to participate because of their personal situation. For example, a school visit to caves where pupils must wear a hard hat will indirectly discriminate against a pupil who wears a turban as part of their religion. Discrimination can be: Institutional: this happens when the policies and procedures of an organisation allow practice which directly or indirectly discriminates against someone Individual: this may be practised by individuals or groups within the school."
"I enjoy listening more than talking. Not that I was born loving to be silent and listen to people\u2019s stories. But I realized that talking only gives me opportunities to make lots of new friends whereas listening brings people closer to me, in the most truthful and sincere ways. On the other hand, I am a true music lover as well as a person who love to make people happy. Integrating those two aspects together I found myself enjoy sharing my music openly and entertain people with my acoustic guitar, my ukulele and my limited knowledge of music."
"S. Consulate in Tijuana Tuesday, demanding that they be processed through the asylum system more quickly and in greater numbers, that deportations be halted and that President Trump either let them into the country or pay them $50,000 each to go home\u201d (\u201cGustavo Solis\u201d). The cost involving deportation has increased tremendously over the past few years. \u201cIn 2017 there were over 200,000 deportation cases reported by the end of December; (\u201cNyla Rush\u201d). \u201cOver the past 3 years more than $746.3 billion dollars was spent towards the deportation of illegal immigrants; putting the United States in more debt than it already is\u201d (\u201cDeportation V."
"\u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d and \u201cThe Grapes of Wrath\u201d both examine the morality and necessary actions the characters choose as they pursue their dreams. Steinbeck uses the concept that dreams are better that reality, but that the dream is really hard to grasp. This concept is also used by three other famous authors who are Crane, Norris, and Dreiser (Benson 256-257). What is the American dream? The American dream is the faith held by many Americans, that through hard work, courage, and determination one can adhere financial prosperity and also some believe that it is led to an emphasis of material wealth as a measure of success and/or happiness. Like many people today the characters George, Lennie, Candy, Curley\u2019s wife, and the Joads all wanted the American dream."
"An excellent friend is a person we enjoy spending time with. A good friend is not only someone to talk to about the interests, but also someone who is willing to listen to the opinions and keep all secrets. We cannot expect friends to accept everything, but they should respect the rights of one each otherand have their own ideas. It is easy to be friends with many people, but good friends are the ones whom we always depend on and we cherish the happy moments spent together."
"The future outlook for the economic environment appears to be positive, a sentiment shared by investors who were quick to purchase the forestry assets divested by Gunns in 2010 (Gunns Limited 2011a). The advantages of operating in a stable domestic economy will be realised once the Australian dollar appreciates to pre-GFC levels and the ill effects of the GFC itself have subsided."
"Migration is the movement of people across a specified boundary for the purpose of establishing a new or semi-permanent residence. External migration is where residences change between a residential unit in the Demographic Surveillance Systems (DSA) with one outside it, and internal migration is where residences change from one residential unit to another in the same DSA (Indepth 2008). Migration is a process of civilians moving from one region to another region by some push and pull factors. Certain push and pull factors like brain drain, racism, better living standards and higher chances of employment cause a particular person to migrate."
"Yes, in our society dark things such as older men preying on younger boys does happen but it does not mean it happens in every single time contact occurs between the two. Throughout the story the idea of miracles is questioned. Tom as a boy wished and prayed for silk worms of his own. \u201cJust one silkworm\u2026 such a simple thing\u201d to his disbelief every leaf he turned over he did not find a single silkworm. \u201cBut every time the leaf was bare\u2026I cursed god with all the passion of betrayal\u201d. Yet that night a local boy he had never met dropped off silkworms, a whole box, right to his doorstep. So I got my miracle after all\u2026 I had never been so frightened in my life\u201d."
"Inspiration keeps us living and breathing no matter what. When inspiration fails, we lose the desire to continue on life\u2019s path. Life without inspiration is a dark, dreary world, where the rainbow has no colour and the birds have no songs. Instead they become vague images and sounds instead of \u201coh my goodness look at that beautiful rainbow and listen to that cheerful sound of the birds singing sweet fully in the tree tops. Inspirational friends help to lead a person in the right way and everyone needs one to become a better person."
"The idea of the plot runs through a lot of ideas on rules playwrights should follow in order for their play to be a success. The main idea of plot is that only one storyline should follow throughout the story or otherwise it overcomplicates it. If there is more that one they can\u2019t be explained well, or are rushed which will make them pointless, in a realistic drama it is best as there is no moving around of set. An inspector calls does follow the rules of the Greek Unities which were set down by Greek philosopher Aristotle. Time, Space and Action are the three points that make it up. Time means that the story should be set in real time."
"When he on the travels he finished his novel, \u201cNoli Me tangere\u201d and published it. This means that his travels help him to realize and to think about our country\u2019s position at that time. His travel made Him famous, Socialize and meet true friends that helps him to become a full of wisdom hero. And his travels made the Philippines famous not to be called as \u201cindio\u201d but also a country that has people with great and amazing talents and knowledge."
"After Lennie\u2019s death, it might be possible for George to realise his dream, but the emptiness at the end of the novel shows that financial success is nothing when you are lonely. So the dream is not just something to own, or possess, but also something to share. \u2018Compassion and love\u2019, to Steinbeck \u2013 as outlined in his Nobel Prize speech are the most important things, as is \u2018hope\u2019 \u2013 having a dream."
"That being said, I believe we need to take the information we have today that the scientists and climatologists have provided and act with a sense of urgency to protect our world. I believe we have a responsibility to act now if not for ourselves, then for our future generations to live on this Earth."
"When Cassie, the narrator, tries to persuade Big Ma to move the wagon forward near the other farmers Big Ma replies; \u201cBut them\u2019s white folks\u2019 wagon Cassie\u2019, and although she didn\u2019t know it, that explained everything This regime of terror had not only the direct effects of the violence, but it had a great psychological effect. In the four different texts there are two examples of this: Firstly in the Book Roll of Thunder, when Cassie rebels against the offensive words printed in her book Mrs. Crocker, their teacher just replies, \u201cWell that\u2019s what you are, now go and sit down\u201d."
"Our other relationships that shape our identity would be our teachers. They teach us what is good and bad and they educate us and help us. Our employers are another source that shapes our identity; they shape out who we are and what our profession is. Our society and neighbours also shape our identity. In the novel \u201cGrowing up Asian in Australia\u201d, Tom Cho wrote a short story called \u201cLearning English\u201d. He had to learn English to mingle with this neighbours and the society he lived in. When he first arrived in Australia, he didn\u2019t know English, so he found it difficult to communicate with everyone. He learned English for the society, so the society shaped him."
"More so, attitudes by adolescents during pregnancy through psychological mechanisms shape the effects of depression after childbirth (Whitworth, 2017). The expected ability to socially and economically provide and care for a child determined the depressive symptoms during teen pregnancy thus the incapability to have enough resources results to damage in mental health. Ultimately, adolescent childbearing results to adult depression as it makes desired educational attainment and expected income unattainable due to unplanned for responsibilities. Therefore, for better mental health adjustment to unexpected life events, individuals need the right attitudes and less depression results to attainment of desired social and economic status and drives away mental health and physical problems."
"He said all kinds of unreasonable things such as: if there was anyone she shed left out of her discussions, please to let him know, he would fill that person in also, he hadn\u2019t realized getting married was such a violation of privacy, and may be if children were so important to her, she should have suggested a fertility test before the engagement\u2026\u2026. back and forth, back and forth, the anger mounting, the words meaningless, expect to wound."
"In our society male usually works and female takes care of the family activities because people believe that women is too delicate and sensitive to work. Many people believe that family life will also be more productive and peaceful in this way. The up bringing of children can be better in this way. Furthermore, people do not like to expose their females to every body. This is considered a way to honor the women (this does not mean those females are living a depressed life, in a way they are more independent and relax in their life). But there are still uneducated people in our country who never things, that how they can success in their lives now I am going to talk about the real conflict about the cousin of mine with her father. She was very obedient and intelligent from her childhood and in the family every persons loved her because of her humble nature. She was very hard working lady; she finished her education from a well renowned university in Pakistan and she was highly motivated for NGO job because she wanted to help the poor masses of the country."
"This is because, as\u00a0readers, we know that the character is disillusioned, and falling for the false promise of prosperity. Racism is posed throughout the novella; in the 1990s segregation laws were approved, whereby the rights of black and white people were divided; black people generally had the things lacking in quality, i.e. Crooks\u2019 inhumane segregation on the ranch. Habitual use of racism, for example flippant use of the word \u2018N****r\u2019 are prevalent in this novella. There were also groups of people who were explicity posed against blacks, for example the KKK, who presented violence towards the black minorities, by ambushing them and/or lynching them."
"Outside the framework of the specifically motherhood and fatherhood characteristics where they perform absolutely different functions; men and women have vast areas to conquer, building life shoulder to shoulder as human beings, equal in humanity. Then, the roles of women in the 1950s are drastically different compared to a woman\u2019s role in today\u2019s world. There were many things women had to do to please their spouse during the 1950s. Arrange his pillow and offer to take off his shoes. Speak in a low, soft, soothing voice."
"This has the effect of increasing tension and provides the audience with insight into the pre change nature of Gwen. As the text continues Gow places Gwen in many situations of conflict, the most substantial of these includes argument with her daughter Meg. This confrontation is extremely ironic as Gwen is ignorant of her qualities however easily identifies them in others. An example includes \u201cYour developing a nasty streak, your becoming a snide, nasty snide girl\u201d from Act 2 scene 3."
"On the alternative side of the argument, there are multiple reasons why animal testing is a good thing. For starters, animal testing has helped to create many of the medicines in our world. The kinds of benefits from animal research that researchers have made in understanding and treating diseases would not have been possible without animal research. Many people argue about how it is cruel and inhumane to animals; well would they rather it was humans being tested? Maybe they would like to send their brother or sister in for experimental testing? While animal testing may seem cruel, the hypothetical alternative is even worse."
"From April 2005 a \u2018duty to co-operate\u2019 was implemented to improve the well-being of children and young people and the act named Local Authorities (LA), Primary Care Trusts (PCT), Strategic Health Authorities, Connexions Services, Youth Offending Services (YOS), the Police Force, the Probation Service, and the Learning and Skills Council as organisations under this duty. The five key outcomes from the ECM Framework: being healthy; stay safe; enjoy and achieve; achieve economic well-being; make a positive contribution; are at the heart of the agenda."
"Cultural identity is a piece of work that fails to\u00a0be completed and is always in process. The discussion of cultural identity is broken into two ways of thinking, one being cultural identity as something that unifies or as the cultural practices shared amongst a certain group of individuals (393)."
"responses, happiness constitutes an integral part of an ongoing functional process, a part of our biological makeup that serves \ufb01tness-enhancing functions by mobilizing appropriate responses to immediate circumstances and events\u201d( Nes et al). Through this, we see the ideas in Walter\u2019s actions when his mindset on money changes at the end of the play. Despite their future being uncertain and living in a new place, they are facing forward, being happy, and optimistic about themselves. The plan to succeed in their own lives first begin with being there for each other and being positive about what the future may hold for all of them."
"The latter title however gives us a glimpse of what the current title means. It has to be a direction. He travels north by a means of transport referred to as northwest. Tracing the hero\u2019s adventurous journey, we see that he moves from New York to Chicago and then he flies north by northwest airlines to Mount Rushmore in South Dakota. This is obviously a northwesterly route. This is the most probable explanation for Hitchcock\u2019s classic flick."
"Order is one of the important factors that make a happy family. With the order, there is no chaos or confusion in the home. A well-organized family will be able to function smoothly and easily in completing various tasks that each individual must do. When each individual knows his/her own responsibility, he/she is capable and able to bring more harmony and peace in the home."
"& Schultz, J. B. , 2001, p. 509). \u201cThe main idea is that one\u2019s sense of identity is determined largely by the choices and commitments made regarding certain personal and social traits\u201d (Learning Theories Knowledgebase, 2009). Now, let us go over Marcia\u2019s stages by using the story of my journey for identity as an example. The first stage is Identity Diffusion; the status in which the adolescent does not have a sense of having choices; he or she has not yet made (nor is attempting/willing to make) a commitment (Learning Theories Knowledgebase, 2009)."
"The Chimera, according to a Greek mythology, is a monstrous fire-breathing creature that has parts of multiple animals: the body of a lion with a tail that ended in a snake\u2019s head, two heads one of a goat and the other of a lion. Her father was the giant Typhon and her mother the half-serpent EcThidna. She had as brothers Cerberus (the hound of Hell), Sphinx, Hydra (the nine-headed water snake), and Orthrus (another multi-headed dog)."
"Orestes seems noble but actually does kill Clytemnestra and Clytemnestra had seemingly good reason to kill Agamemnon but it all could be discovered excuses for wanting to be with another man. A play where all the characters are at fault, some would interpret as. This means that there aren\u2019t any characters to sympathise with just elements or past situations that we can sympathise with if we think them through fully enough."
"Behind all this raw beauty hides an even more impressive truth: earth is balanced flawlesslesly to be a cordial environment for humans and there\u2019s no way that this is a coincidence. It is proven that if the force of gravity were even marginally different in a single direction, it would be too hot for life to exist on earth."
"Racism is more complex than before, you cannot find the sign appears evidently in front of you but it occurs in every small detail in our day-to-day life. According to The Millennials (Generation Y): Segregation, Integration and Racism, Geraldine Brown mentioned racism just does not concern a dominant racial group overly oppressing minorities. There is subtle racism describes racial microaggressions based on race (Brown 7). According to Unmasking \u2018Racial Micro Aggressions\u2019, Tori DeAngelis states one of the forms of racial microaggresions is aversive racism, which is common in today\u2019s society (42). Whereas aversion is based socially and is subtle, microggresion leads to the threat of racism. For example, if race B\u2019s qualifications are just as strong or as week as the race A\u2019s, race A tends not to discriminate against race B (DeAngelis 42). However, when there is a huge disproportion between two race and race B\u2019s qualification seems to lower than race A\u2019s, race A tends to favor their own race versus race B (DeAngelis 42). We choose to think, I only did that because I was the normal thing to do (DeAngelis 42). The same evidence occurs in Hidden Figures, white employees have larger offices than \u201cblack\u201d employees and when Katherine is required that does not speak with the department head, Mr. Harrison unless he speaks to her first. The different light between two places that Katherine works in, West Area Computing and Space Task Group continues to give us more evidence to prove the segregation in NASA. In West Are Computing, the room is a little darker than in Space Task Group, where the light is much brighter. This proves the different values that NASA gives the professional skills and people who work in two places. From those examples, we can recognize these are subtle racism, in which \u201cwhites\u201d are represented as more intelligent and have higher qualifications class than \u201cblacks\u201d; therefore, they are assumed that they can disregard or discriminate against \u201cblacks\u201d, those who are lower than them."
"By the time Sophie has moved out of her mother\u2019s place she believes she may be free but realizes that her mother is not. When she is with her sexual phobia group, she understands that the person who has wronged her, Martine, has been unable to be free. Sophie says, \u201cI knew my hurt and hers were links in a long chain and if she hurt me, it was because she was hurt, too\u201d (203). She comes to the realization that there is a reason why her mother did what she did and that in order for her to be free, her mother needs to be free from her past as well. Her mother\u2019s rape had given her nightmares that she was able to \u201cfree\u201d her mother from, but only from the nightmares themselves, not from the reality of the rape."
"The low class residential zone surrounds the transition zone. This area contains some of the older often terraced housing areas of the city. Originally, the area housed families who moved out of poor quality housing in the transition zone, but who still need to live close to their working place because of high travel costs."
"Although, for decades white on black crime continue to be an issue, the controversial topic became popular with the death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed seventeen-year old African American shot dead in 2012 when walking home from a 711- convenience store. In the year of 2017 alone, police killed 1,147 people, in which twenty five percent of them being a person of colored and unarmed (Mapping Police Violence, 2018). As an individual with a job that its main duty is to serve and protect all citizens of their country, they are targeting people of color with no remorse or justification. With young African Americans being a prime target to these officers, as a person who is half African American, I fear for my brothers, my cousins, my friends, and even their families. Grieving a loss of a loved one is argumentatively one of the hardest experiences one would have to deal with, especially if an innocent life has been taken."
"In her talk to Victoria, Tish once again says that she knows Fonny is not guilty. Her argument is simple: she has known him all his life (Baldwin 141). Not the striving to change the society\u2019s beliefs about race, but Tish\u2019s true love and commitment to Fonny move her to the victory. In a similar vein, love is the only source of hope for Fonny: \u201cBaby. Baby. Baby. I love you. And I\u2019m going to build us a table and a whole lot of folks going to be eating off it for a long, long time to come\u201d (Baldwin 163). With their love, as well as the hope and faith born out of their love, Tish and Fonny successfully pass the test of separation."
"In addition, the death penalty costs roughly the same amount as life in prison throughout the United States. The costs in each state differs depending on the amount of death penalty cases held there. People also argue that life in prison isn\u2019t as strong as a punishment as the death penalty. A study by Dudley Sharp, the Death Penalty Resources Director of Justice For All, claims that LWOP (leave without pay) cases cost $1.2 million -$3.6 million more than equivalent death penalty cases (Top). This shows that in some cases, the death penalty costs roughly the same or even less than the cost of life in prison for being seen as a far worse punishment. Lastly, the death penalty doesn\u2019t go against the USA\u2019s constitution. One example of this being proven is in the case Gregg v. Georgia. The Court found that the death penalty was not unconstitutional as it could serve the social purposes of retribution and deterrence (Death). This helps prove how the death penalty doesn\u2019t violate basic human rights since the constitution, being a very credible source, believes that its not inhumane to have. In opposition of this view, people argue that in some cases, the methods carried out in capital punishments violate the Eighth Amendment. Based on the evidence shown, the death penalty should be legal and carried out by most states/countries. All the reasons supporting the death penalty are far stronger and counter the opposing views. One of the main supporters of the death penalty is the President of the United States, Donald Trump. This is a highly credible source as he has a position which is very influential in the United States."
"I chose these selections because I thought they would best help my research paper. Each journal displays some negative effect of illegal immigrants on the host country or a law relating to illegal immigrants and the affect that law has on the people. Some papers display good outcomes for the host country, but might not necessarily be good for the country in a real life situation."
"The differences in Boston from 1850-1900. In the city of Boston, there was a lot that changed of course that had occurred between the second half of the 19th century, not only with the city but also with the people living in Boston. There were land changes that occurred during the second half of the 19th century such as the South End and the Backed Bay."
"Family is one of the most important elements in a person\u2019s life, according to the Cambridge dictionary family is a group of people who are related to each other, such as a mother, a father and their children. Families also may be connected to other relatives and members. Each family has its own characteristics depending on the community, the background and the area it\u2019s related to. Families and their habits, properties, and elements differ around the world. Any change, whether social, economic, health, educational or any other possible changes on any member of the family may cause change and affect all the other members in the family."
"The third event that we conducted was an event called Best Seat in the House. Our chapter president Autumn Hutchinson gave us this great idea after coming back from DECA\u2019s fall competitive conference. This event including our last home game of the season against one of our biggest rivals in the parish. Students and community members had the opportunity to buy raffles tickets to have a chance to sit on the sidelines of the game in a big comfy couch donated by Ashley Furniture. While they got to sit on the sidelines, they also got to eat a meal of a burger and fries donated by the locally owned Big Mike\u2019s Sports Bar and Grill. Each Ticket was sold for $2 a piece\u00a0with 41 tickets sold. For the first time hosting this event it was a success and raised us $82.00 toward the Muscular Dystrophy Association."
"A fouteen year old boy, who had been in the UK for 6 months was quoted as saying: \u2018What is a GP?\u2019\u00a0(Kidane, 2001 in Hek, 2005)\u00a0Language difficulties also prevent UASC from accessing primary healthcare, and also prolong the time before a diagnosis is made (Rutter, 2003). This can be seen as a structural oppression. Interpreters can be employed to overcome this, however, outside London or big cities interpreters with the appropriate language may not be available (Rutter, 2003). One unaccompanied minor was quoted as saying: \u2018The doctor never arranges for interpreters. There is never anyone there.\u2019 (Gosling, 2000 in Hek, 2005)"
"He says he\u2019s \u201cbadly hurt but not feeling any pain\u201d building suspension and leaving the readers on the edge of there seats wanting to know what\u2019s happened and if he\u2019s alright, but sadly he\u2019s not. In the consideration of there sons services they receive a \u2018certain sum\u2019 adding the most tension/suspense of all in the story leaving readers shocked as they know what\u2019s coming, Mr. Whites lips are dry with the fear building up inside him as he asks the question he doesn\u2019t even need to ask, \u201chow much\u201d"
"The photographer must have understood that the black Americans had always been left trailing behind the success of the white population of America and that they were not experiencing the happiness that is portrayed by the white people in the poster. The photographer must have understood the irony of the photograph that purely black Americans who are queuing up for government relief are pictured with the slogans, \u2018there\u2019s no way like the American way\u2019 and \u2018world\u2019s highest standard of living\u2019 and a picture of a wealthy, happy, confident white family in their car of freedom, affluence and higher standard of living."
"When you are going good stop! \u201d \u201cIf you stop when you are stuck, then you are in trouble! \u201d It shows that Dahl is speaking to children in particular and that he wants their attention. Lastly I want to compare the structure of both texts. The Mail online has a very simple structure to attract an almost illiterate tpe of audience. It is stuctured in small paragraphs with breaks in between each paragraph. The text is edited and therefore it is made to suit the audience. It also has two very large images which have been used for the more visual learners."
"In fact, well over a hundred studies have been published noting the harmful effects of discrimination on the health of African American men, women, and children. Unfortunately, results have provided us with disturbing data. The findings show that not only does racism have a direct effect on an individual\u2019s physical health but also mental health as well. In addition, studies reveal several disturbing reasons one of them being inferior health care for minorities."
"These women who were fragmented, jigsawed characters have, by their own selves, began to piece together a new life; a life which defies traditional discourses. Their holiday together has given them a chance to allow self-discovery and has created hope for their future. Janice Galloway\u2019s unique style is what I believe makes her novel, \u201cForeign Parts\u201d truly accomplished. The disjointedness of her two characters is portrayed perfectly throughout the book and is essential in relaying the themes \u201cForeign Parts\u201d explores."
"According to the book, The Economic Worth of Celebrity Endorsers: An Event Study Analysis Studies, by Jagdish Agrawal, studies show that when celebrities endorse a product, it sells over 20% more. Rap artist Kanye West discussed running for president in 2020; already there were \u201cKanye for president\u201d shirts made. Politically, for America, this would mean another politically uneducated president, after Trump. Celebrities are looked up to and idolized by citizens, so when they tell people to do something, they are more likely to do it. This is why their lyrics are so meaningful when celebrities promote things in their songs, good or bad; people are more likely to listen most likely follow. As studies show, 85% of people listen to music, of that 85%, 17% of male adolescence and 25% of female adolescence, said they listen to rap music for the lyrics. So if the lyrics are negative they are becoming brainwashed, after singing the song multiple times, they begin to believe rape, sexism, violence, and drugs are okay, as seen in the eighth and seventh-grade study. For positive lyrics, however, they begin also to become more socially aware of the world. Lyrics can be very dangerous if taken lightly.From the years 1998 to 2008, 10.7 of Americans purchased at least one rap album. There are about 300 million Americans, so of that 10.7 who purchased rap albums, they are either getting negative or positive messages. What do people think when they hear these lyrics; more importantly, think about the impact this music has on our lives. Rappers and their music have had political, social, economic, and historical impacts on the American society."
"Friendship is one of the most beautiful and fragile relationships in the world. Our friends are our pillars of strength and give us the much needed support and comfort that we all seek in life. Spending time with true friends is one of the greatest joys in the world. So why are friends so important in our lives? Why is the value of a true friend equated sometimes even with a parent or a soul mate? And what is that invisible bond that holds friends together for years and sometimes even a lifetime? And most importantly, what are the lessons in life that friendship teaches us? Trust"
"Finally, California reached the breaking point. As reported by CBS, on March 3, 1991, four police officers were caught on film brutality beating King when capturing him after a case. This was a shock to the world and what came next was an even bigger shock. In April of 1992, Rodney King\u2019s assaulters were acquitted by a majority white jury. The next three days were utter chaos. California was experiencing looting, riots, arson, mass levels of violence, and social unrest; leaving fifty-five civilians dead and over 2,000 injured. For the next few months resulted in unrest and riots. Among the chaos, Ice Cube released a song called, \u201cWe Had to Tear This Muthafucka Up.\u201d In the song, Cube says:\u201dNot guilty the filthy devils tried ta kill meWhen the news get to the hood then niggas will behotter than cayenne pepper, cuss, bustKickin up dust is a mustI can\u2019t trust a cracker in a blue uniform\u201dCube is painting a picture of what is occurring in California; he is showing the story of the Rodney King case and its effects on society; the deadly riots, and the loss in trust of the police. The song brought much awareness to the issue and the fact that police brutality was happening all over and not just in California.Another positive message that comes out of rap music is hope. This message goes hand in hand with the message of awareness of social and political issues. Rap artist tends to respond to social issues in the world with songs of hope. For example, Tupac released a song called, \u201cChanges,\u201d The song talks about the reality drugs, violence, and race."
"The account, writes De Ia Merced, will open your eyes to the errors, unnoticed hut rampant in that book called Pasong Mahal, which is really the work of an ignoramus. \u2019 The major criticisms of the Pasyon Pilapil are its incoherence, faulty scholarship, repetitiveness, and clumsy, inaccurate use of language. \u201d (Ileto, 13) However, in terms of the translation, we found out that the original Pasyon, which we discovered that it was really a Filipino who wrote the book. Gaspar Aquino de Belen, a bilingual poet and a translator made the first Pasyon under the order of the Spanish missionaries, the Encomienda System that orders the people to convert the people into Catholic religion."
"As one of the major players in the aviation industry, Virgin Atlantic have taken it upon themselves to be seen as the leading light in making the industry more environmentally friendly. As part of the companies vision for sustainable aviation, Virgin Atlantic have begun to implement more efficient methods of air travel around some of the world\u2019s largest airports. These changes are aimed to cut the amount of fuel used by the aircraft; thus improving the quality of the air and reducing the level of carbon dioxide emissions."
"The black cloth next to the coffin could show something connected to the person in the coffin next to it, their soul or personality for instanced and how that is no longer there when a person dies. The rose upon this black cloth again can represent the love of someone you\u2019ve left behind. The large question mark drawn on the floor could represent many things, how the person died or the fact that its unknown as to what happens when we die, or that we don\u2019t know what the future holds. The \u2018Dear Diary\u2026 \u2018 without any thing written after shows that we don\u2019t know what is going to happen to us in the future."
"She is a bitter and scornful woman who shamelessly uses sex to intimidate the workers. However after Lennie murders her you see her in a different light, as when she is in peace Steinbeck describes her as \u2018pretty and simple, and her face was sweet and young\u2019. Steinbeck could be implying that she is now happy as she got to talk to Lennie and is no longer lonely, and her only escape was death as she is no longer suffering. From the character of Curley\u2019s wife we learn lots about the period the book was written in and how difficult it was for a woman to fit into a man\u2019s world."
"Sindh is most urbanized province which is facing large number of povert, lack of provisions, there is less concept of women education, mostly they are out of school. It is mostly estimated that about 52% of Sindhi women are out of the school or are uneducated. Like other provinces of the Pakistan Sindh has same setup or system of the education. According to research this system taking place in 6 subfield that are katchi, primary, middle, secondary and higher secondary and tertiary, but there is confusion I am not agree with this setup which is mentioned in research by the Sindh education department. They might be wright but there is no implementation on the system which is mentioned in paper. The system of education which is being followed in Sindh that is mentioned as; primary, elementary, secondary and higher secondary. We will describe each of them with some description which are currently attending and following in different educational institutions."
"loneliness. Affair is also creating conflict between them because he or she doesn\u2019t like to each other and always blame on each other. Many people live under one roof and all people mind are not same so they like to live as nuclear family that\u2019s lead to change structure of family. We can\u2019t spend more time with children because when we are live together then work load is increased as compare to nuclear family. Some people like live independent life that\u2019s they live life as nuclear family. Poor family planning or fertility also changes family structure. In some case, women can\u2019t able to born any child due to fertility."
"has helped the research community to explain and predict the different roles performed by people in society by tracing the observable behaviour to being male or female. Personal and societal view of what it means to be a men or women has propagated peoples approach to their function in the home and society (Marfo 2011). However, little is known on this subject about the influence of structural changes and shifts in social relationships among them. This explains how researchers have relied on several and often unstable structural and normative process in deciding to act, of which participation in child care roles is one variable subject to action. Thus, concepts such as degendering\u2019 as postulated by Lorber (2005), especially in understanding men\u2019s motivation towards child care, become one of possible plausible explanations to the whole complexity of the drive to act. Several research works have also been done on how men and women create, experience and sustain their masculinities and feminities in their day to day living. Early work on masculinity (e.g. Connell 1985, 1987, 1995; Morgan 1992) however, acknowledges the identity of men as not static but moves with changes in social relations. The masculine concept of care is inherent in the work of Connell (1987), and like Collinson (1994) and Brandth and Kvade (1998), and in these, men\u2019s participation in child care has been discussed in the context of negotiated power relations between men and women, basically, an interactionist perspective.A critical view of current literature also indicates that the propensity to care is built upon how men interact and relate to the structural institutions such as culture, childhood and marriage relations among others. On another level, the prevailing situational conditions such as men\u2019s availability to care, economic relations between men and women, and characteristics of the child and its needs are also influential. Another line of research has explained the performance or non-performance of care duties in the home as function of situational factors, both social and economic. For example, changing family economic relations are considered as an important process determining the participation of men in child care. As more women enter paid work, men find it inevitable to assist with child care duties (Hauari and Hollingworth (2009). This scenario therefore leads to a shift in the immediate factors motivating men to care for children. This however, does not suggest that other explanations, are redundant, but represents an addition to the population of variables at play in motivating men\u2019s care behaviour.In the background of knowledge generated around this subject, it is sound to accept that construction of masculinity and or fatherhood is a continuous process, never permanent and constant. Extending that, localizing knowledges is also important. Emerging philosophical foundations of child care and development in Africa as a discipline advocates for a rich within culture explanation of care practices if relevant policies around child care and development are to be developed (Pence and Marfo, 2008; Marfo, 2011). In this perspective, the research moves away from concentrating on asking who should care towards an understanding of why one (men in particular) choose to care. The presence of numerous factors influencing the decision to care has motivated this research to assume a systems thinking\u2019 approach in understanding why men chose to participate in the care of children."
"In terms of the crisis of teen pregnancy rates in the United States, we have, by far, the highest rate of occurrence than any other country in the Western industrial world. However, there are a couple of great ways we can all help diminish and/or solve this issue: promoting abstinence to our teen population and educating teens on the different forms of contraceptives available, such as birth control pills or IUDs and condoms. The United States is supposed to be a land of great opportunity, however, if our nation\u2019s young generations keep getting pregnant and having babies rather than taking advantage of all this awesome country has to offer in compliance to colleges and higher paying jobs after getting a degree than we won\u2019t be offering them much of an opportunity. Attempt to give the teens of this country a chance to live for these opportunities by getting more people to promote sexual abstinence and education of the different forms of contraceptives to every teen they encounter. It is the only way this country will remain as great as it is!"
"In evening, we were usually watching comedy films and films about the battles. But on another day we decided to have a party, so we went to a local disco named as? Discovery? And the life would be more interesting that night if I didn?t quarrel with my best friend. We started arguing only for our own interests; he insisted on drinking some alcohol and dance, I insisted on not doing that because it would bring big problems and moreover it would be shame on ourselves."
"The essay is gloomy, reflecting Addison\u2019s own reflections on death and acknowledging it as the great provider of equity, for as he so eloquently states: Upon this, I began to consider with myself what innumerable multitudes of people lay confused together under the pavement of that ancient cathedral \u2026 how beauty, strength, and youth, with old age, weakness, and deformity, lay undistinguished in the same promiscuous heap of matter (2-3). The Spectator was published daily, and it grew to great popularity among the people of England. The Spectator\u2019s political quips and insights into life and the state of their nation lent it a great deal of influence over the people of that time. Of the 555 or so essays featured in the periodical, Addison composed 274 (Biography of Joseph Addison 1). The Spectator lasted 3.5 years and was one of the few bright spots in Joseph Addison\u2019s rather uneventful life, which was filled with personal disappointments (Joseph Addison (1672-1719) 1). One such disappointment was his marriage to the Dowager Countess of Warwick."
"There are also many school districts in the communities of Canada that offer types of programs for children to participate in, depending on the time of year and a few other things like availability of staff/volunteers. During the winter months, there are inside activities to do such as intramurals and sports. During the warmer months there is often outside sports and activities of the kind. These activities can be free or even require that a small fee that has to be paid."
"Many websites or groups will try to persuade you into either pro-life or pro-choice. If you\u2019re thinking about either one of them, at the end of the day just make the decision for yourself. Not for your boyfriend or mother. Make it for you. The bottom line is that any woman should be able to have that choice, a choice that no one can take away from her."
"Paiget describes adaptation as the process by which structures of the mind develop over time to achieve a better fit with the environment and external reality. My cousin is still eating food in large portions as she did when she was pregnant but now she is drinking more milk because she chose to breastfeed her baby. Therefore she keeps gaining weight and is also stressed out. As far as her mental state she is stressed and cannot focus on herself because she is constantly thinking about the well-being of her baby. She worries just as much as other mothers do because she wants her baby to be happy."
"Canadian government introduced many immigration laws and policies and invited people from European and non-European countries to apply for immigration. The protagonist Nina migrates to Canada under the family reunification class via marriage to her Canadian Indian-born husband. The family reunification class was one of the first immigrant classes in which women immigrants were allowed to come to Canada."
"Personally, I do not like this assumption that Jesus was once done for actions that are seen as questionable. Furthermore, Strauss then uses Albert Schweitzer and his writings that talk about that the picture of Jesus was modified by rationalistic scholars into a gentleman and philanthropist (Pg. 12). Strauss compares this scenario that took place in the 19 th century to todays society. He says that we make Jesus seem like a Santa Clause or a mans man. This is not entirely true. While I do accept as true."
"You could see by their facial expressions that their pride was different from that of the white men. In some of their pictures some of them were actually smiling unlike the pictures of white soldiers I have seen. I think it because they were truly happy to be fighting for their cause. Frederick Douglass put it best when he stated that blacks were, \u201cthe pivot upon which the whole rebellion turns, this war, disguise it as they may, is virtually nothing more or less then perpetual slavery against universal freedom and to this end the free states will have to come.\u201d The 650 men of the all black 54th Massachusetts regiment proved to the Union that blacks were useful soldiers during the battle at Battery Wagner in South Carolina. Even though the Confederates were ahead in this battle, the battle ultimately ended in a protracted siege that was enabled by the 54th. It was because of their battle other black regiments were deemed worthy to fight."
"In 2001 the total literacy rate in India is 65.8. The woman literacy rate is 54.16 while male literacy rate is 75% this shows that woman literacy rate is low, In spite of many schemes for girl education. We have to make minds of girl child parent to send them school.These are the random problems and many are under curtains. The one perfect remedy is the proper implementation of laws and schemes for woman. Though significant improvements are have taken in the position of woman in the 50 years following independence, women continue to suffer from the problems like violence, illiteracy and ill health Together we have to work in the way of gender equality, woman wale fare so that a woman can live proudly as human being and not as servant nor as goddess."
"Bishop Locati Luigi Children\u2019s home needs to hire a child psychologist to speak to the children especially the ones who have gone through psychological torture. Others have been abused by their own family members and that makes them run and become street children. They need guidance on how to integrate themselves to the world after they actually leave the home and not be confused about their purpose in life and eventually turn to drugs or crime."
"Presidents John F. Kennedy, Abraham Lincoln also Martin Luther King Jr. were assassinated (Doeden 26). The people who committed these offences were seemingly normal everyday people like you and me but the lack of laws and restrictions regarding background checks allow these criminals or the mentally unstable to acquire deadly weapons and cause mass unnecessary death. Gun control has been a political idea since the signing of our constitution. Only a few years after our nation was born New York politician, Rufus King, said \u201cThat it was dangerous to put arms into the hands of the frontier people for their defense, lest they should use them against the United States\u201d (qtd."
"He says he was going to put me in the movies. Says I was a natural. Soon\u2019s he got back to Hollywood he was going to write to me about it\u201d what this man really wanted to was to sleep with her. I don\u2019t think he was in the movies at all, I think he was just claiming, it would be highly unnatural for a Hollywood film producer to turn up in a small place like Soledad, like a famous person turning up in Bloxwitch, it wouldn\u2019t happen on an everyday basis. This is why her mother wouldn\u2019t let her \u201cmy ol\u2019 lady wouldn\u2019t let me\u201d her mother wouldn\u2019t let her go with him because he wanted to protect her. This shows that Curleys\u2019 wife is shallow- cares about her appearance, gullible- believes everything that she is told, and na\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve- meaning that she is too trusting to people."
"No one wants to read devasting stories without cures. Now that you have stated the problem, what do you suggest be done? This part will need to be reasonable because the cost for the fixes should not be too high. You will want to be as detailed as possible by citing examples where those fixes have worked. You will base your thoughts on the fact that someone may want to adopt your model and implement the fixes."
"Visual game: happiness. Nowadays, countless PC, video, and mobile games flourish in the game market. With the development of visual reality technology, we can even play the games in a more real way. But why we play the games? We all know the games are not real, no matter how actual the technology makes them to be. The answer is that they bring happiness. I apply the same reasoning in the real life, if the world is not real. Happiness is the main reason why we are obsessed with unreal worlds like games, dreams, and maybe the so-called reality."
"For the second reason, which is politic, and as we know, in some countries especially the underdeveloped one there is some civil wars between the citizenship, this fact means that there is no peace in that country and automatically we know that when there is no peace there is no normal life, because when the war start it damaged anything and everyone who is in front of it, and because of all that some people choose to travel abroad and avoid any trouble caused by the war. At least, and for the third reason, which is the economic one, the most underdeveloped countries suffer from the low salaries that the workers get, which push many of them to think of the immigration."
"There are various ways families can volunteer and become involved with their child\u2019s school. Not all volunteering opportunities should require parental attendance at school sponsored events (Barbour, 2001). Various volunteering opportunities should be made available to parents who are interested in becoming involved. In addition to attending school events, fundraising activities, and chaperoning field trips (Rous, Hallam, Grove, Robinson, & Machara, 2003), parents can support schools by giving their time and resources in other ways such as, fixing playgrounds, cleaning, donating toys, art supplies, furniture, and more (Cochran, 2007). Constructing a survey every year to identify interests, talents, and availability of volunteers may enhance parental involvement (Volunteering, 2006, para. 2). Educators and administrators have to understand volunteers\u2019 schedules and be flexible so that \u201call families know that their time and talents are welcomed and valued\u201d (Volunteering, 2006, para. 3)."
"Thus, providing an argument against animal testing because sometimes, even when animal testing provides positive results, it does not mean that the same result will be present when human trials are done. Many people believe that animal testing is only about testing cosmetics or new drug therapies, however, there are many different uses for animal testing, and Timothy Musch et al discuss some of those uses. \u201cAnimal studies play a part in the initial development of candidate drugs, and the development and testing of medical devices and surgical procedures."
"Orientalism is how we perceive the Asian states, but in particular its how we perceive the Middle East and the Arab world. The Middle East in recent times has been plagued with wars such as those in Afghanistan and Iraq. The region has also seen proxy wars(Syria) and genocides(Yemen) that continue to destabilize the region and affecting power shifts. With this taken into consideration, there are many Orientalist features that continue to affect current relationships within the region."
"One of the well-known stereotypes that I saw growing up in an Asian family is that children must do whatever their parents tell them to, or else they will be disowned. The children must become majorly successful before thirty and be nothing else but doctors. I know for a fact that the family I grew up in considered this normal, and I think it is a moral question to be asked."
"For students whose own parents have limited educational experience, programs of educational counseling and tutoring are particularly helpful. BIBLIOGRAPHY: 1.

"In both the television shows the main difference is the target audience other than that both shows aim to aid in the cognitive development of children. In Teletubbies it targets the age group of children from 12 to 18 months but Sesame Street targets at a slightly older children, who are between the age of 3 and 5, most importantly those who are about to join kindergarten. The main aim of Sesame Street is to prepare young children for school, to subconsciously prep them for the concepts ahead such as introducing numeracy, literacy and spatial skills (Williamson, N., 1988). Whereas, Teletubbies focuses more on 12 to 18 months of age, including toddlers constructing and delivering messages. Their goal is to help develop cognitive abilities such as recognizing corporeal images and linking them with their names and develop basic sensory development. The characters and puppets have been utilized in both shows to help gravitate the attention of young children. The cheerful colors are also an added bonus but again, the difference in their intent behind the costumes is different. Young children are more physically and motivate in the Teletubbies , on the other hand in Sesame Street it gains attention of young children in order to pass on educational values from the show (Goodman, I., 1976)."
"Abortion is one of the most controver\u00adsial and debated topics today. There have been many court cases that have decided the legality of abortion. However, it will continue to be a hot topic for many future debates. Abortion has many pros and cons that deserve to be properly discussed and deliberated upon, before one makes a decision to support or oppose it."
"About 3,000 women served as Union army nurses. Dorthea Dix was one women who was acknowledged for being the Nation\u2019s first superintendent of women nurses. Clara Barton was recognized for being the first women to work in the U.S. Patent Office and was given the name \u201cAngel of the Battlefield.\u201d Sally Tompkins was a Confederate army nurse commissioned as captain because she performed her hospital duties so heroically. Finally, Belle Boyd was honored for being a brave Confederate nurse and spy."
"In the autumn section of the bluest eye, by Toni Morrison, the most intriguing passage that I have read occurs in the pages 33-34, beginning with; \u201cLetting herself breathe easily now\u2026 \u201d and ending with; \u201cthose pretty eyes. \u201d This passage is particularly unique in the sense that it exposes a lot about Pecola\u2019s situation at that time, her character, her feelings and emotions as well as her desires. The writer uses a number of different literary devices to convey these elements of Pecola\u2019s character."
"There are\u00a0certain groups that may be more vulnerable to exclusion or segregation. These groups include families who hold English as a second language, students who are gifted and talented or are new to the school. In addition to these, families who are of a cultural or ethnic minority, parents whose views and values differ from that of the school or looked after children may also be susceptible to various forms of exclusion. It is important that we are mindful to treat all individuals the same regardless of their beliefs, capabilities or background."
"They are also constantly stereotyped; such as, Chinese people eat dogs. This causes Asian American students to feel insecure and embarrassed when they are reminded of their background. Therefore, the American students do not socially accept them. Yang used Jin\u2019s story to emotionally connect with Asian American students because it shows the negative impression of Asian background. This emotional connection allowed his audience to see Yang\u2019s perspective of negative experience to finding identity and acceptance. Yang also connects his audience with negative Asian American Stereotype."
"Community service was such an eye opener. I have realized there are so many things I take for granted, starting from good health to a successful delivery that is not always guaranteed. I believe everyone should indulge in community service and comfort with those suffering. Community service has helped shape and develop interpersonal skills and have compassion when dealing with people."
"In the small town of Ely, Nevada I had been brought up by a single mother. I loved my mother so dearly, and she loved me more than one could imagine. My mother worked at our local grocery store, bagging groceries for eight hours a day, five days a week, fifty two weeks of the year. She never once called in sick or took a day off."
"In conclusion, law enforcement officers are individuals that are trained to, as the name says, enforce the law. They are responsible for keeping the peace within our community and protect our citizens from harm. They are supposed to be a positive influence on the community, instead they are causing the most harm. Without punishment, this will forever be an ongoing thing. No matter what law enforcement officers do, they rarely face criminal charges, much less jail. And this must be changed. Due to the growing number of victims of police brutality, it is crucial to find the solution how to stop these actions. Serious human rights violations continue, numerous obstacles do not allow accountable police officers to be brought to justice and this impunity allows them to continue the violence."
"Even a liberal view is problematic; these tend to take the view that it is permissible for an abortion to take place before a certain stage in the foetuses development, but not beyond that given point. Such an arbitrary perspective does seem difficult to quantify; how can anyone determine the criteria that would navigate a decision that finds termination acceptable today but morally reprehensible tomorrow?"
"However he releases the idea that business competition, similar to the type his father promotes will bring him success; he can\u2019t escape the rat race of American capitalism. This is similar to the inescapable, futile situation that Lennie and George find themselves in; they move from ranch to ranch, with seeming direction, but the irony lies in the fact\u00a0that their life is totally directionless. The final bitter blow lies in Lennie\u2019s death."
"Kinship and friendship networks (the family) together helps individuals in order to find jobs in the informal economy and provides assistance in the case of hardship and emergencies (Lomnitz, 1977).The various literatures exploring as social organization plays essential role in the life of urban poor (Hossain, 2000, 2001). Urban social organization of the urban poor is a collection of family networks and co-operation found in the family networks is the type of social interaction. In the poor communities most nuclear families lives in the same residential compound arrangement and shares a common housing material or equipment\u2019s. Marriage ties is the base for families are ties/network (Lomnitz, 1997)."
"Culture has elements that are obvious, like unique holidays or customs, but also features that are subtle or easy for outsiders to overlook, like beliefs about the nature of intelligence or about the proper way to tell a story. When a classroom draws students from many cultures or ethnic groups, therefore, the students bring to it considerable diversity."
"Caesar was able to gain Gaul and PO get his acts ratified. o Senate became distressed by the fact that JC formed an alliance with their \u2018golden boy\u2019 PO as they knew very well their fears of JC rising to the highest power could became a reality. o \u201cThis first and worst disaster had not been the quarrel or split between PO and JC but the friendship which had existed between them\u201d Cato o \u201cIn saying this then Cato must bear much of the blame for he and the optimates drove \u201cPompiues into Caesar\u2019s arms\u201d\u201d Bradley and Seager which as Cicero recognised it, was the ultimate origin of the civil war of 49BC 52BC = Death of Julia + Death of Crassus + JC in Gaul = Senate slowly began taking advantage of situation at hand by slowly pulling back PO under the influence of the senatorial forces o Without hesitation 1)awarded rare sole consulship to PO"
"Personal downsides may include post-traumatic stress, guilt and embarrassment from others. Morality, separation of church and state, and dangers of legal abortions are a few main arguments dividing the world on this subject. Abortion shouldn\u2019t necessarily be a go-to but it should definitely be an option. A lot of thinking and decision making goes into this choice, it is not an act of whim as most pro-life supporters may argue."
"Irecently had a student come to me who was dealing with domestic violence. Her husband who had attempted to commit suicide and once his attempt failed he then proceeded to beat on his wife in front of their young son and goddaughter. I couldn\u2019t fathom being in her shoes. Physically I couldn\u2019t do anything to her but I that words are one of the most powerful weapon we have, so I gave her what I could and that was advice. I advised her that since both she and her husband both refused to leave the house that she find someone she trusted to look after her son until she was able to do so, I informed her that one of the worst things a child can see is there parent being abused ( I know from experience) and that with him being a male that is the last thing he should witness so that when he becomes of age the cycle of abuse wouldn\u2019t continue."
"The Confederacy moved west with us in a constant inquiry. We had drawn them to starvation, exhaustion, dispirited, and outnumbered 10 to 1. Lee could no longer retreat and met me that afternoon at Appomattox Court House. I wrote all the terms, and he signed an agreement of surrendering and all the terms. After Lee\u2019s surrender a few weeks later other Confederate troop surrendered. After four years of gory fighting, the Civil war had ended. The Union had been preserved but at a terrible expense. Over the term, the war had lost 600,000 heroic soldiers either killed or from disease, and the south was left in debris. On the other hand, it was the wakeup call for equality of all oriented groups."
"The changes that Coke has made in respects to different features within the working environment have been tremendous to the organization. This can be mirrored within the numerous delivers and acknowledgments the organization has gotten. In arrange to proceed victory with differences, it is crucial that Coke is continually assessing now not as it had been company arrangement, however too that the methods are being actualized fittingly. As already expressed, the claims had been all stemming from troubles with administration from the plants. These supervisors are a coordinate reflection of the organization and ought to have arbitrary differences assessments on a regular premise."
"has been passed, which states that King Henry VIII is now the head of the Church of England. Staying true to his religious beliefs, More is unable to continue in his position as Lord Chancellor due to his belief that the King is attacking the Church of England. His disapproval of the King\u2019s actions\u00a0force him to resign in order to keep his moral conscience, as he can\u2019t be so closely connected to someone he sees as having no conscience, let alone work for them. Cromwell intends to use the information he gained from Rich in order to blackmail More into recognising the King as the head of the English Church, and consenting to the King\u2019s divorce."
"The obstetrician will do medical check such as looking for varicose veins in the legs, looking for any swelling of finger and the legs, checking lungs and heart, checking breasts for inverted nipples or any lumps as well as clinical tests such as blood tests, weight, height and urine tests."
"The practice of abortion is legal in the United States. Abortion law has many sources-constitutions, legislative statues, administrative regulations, and court decisions. The foundation of abortion law is the United States Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court (McBride, 2008). Constitutional law does not directly regulate abortion, but it sets limits on the powers of the states and the federal government to regulate abortion. The authority to regulate abortion has been reserved to the states by the Constitution because Article I, which covers the legislative branch."
"She lives with her mother and her mother helps her by giving her advice from how to comfort the child to how to give the baby a bath. My cousin\u2019s friend had her baby before my cousin and when her friend met my cousin\u2019s child she was also giving her advice on hoe to take care of the baby. She is acquiring knowledge on how to raise her child from people such as her mother that have had years of experience raising children. Her friend told her that she worries to whether she is taking care of her baby the right way. My cousin has to endure a psychological as well as physical adaptation."
"And what\u201ds more, the relationships between the groups \u2013 the persons presented and the interactive participants \u2013 are relevant for the analysis (Machin, 2007). Special importance is attached to the achieved interaction of the representation with the viewer. A direct gaze of the persons depicted into the eyes of the observer acts as a demand of information or services, while an indirect gaze acts as an offer of service or information (Machin, 2007,p.110). The size of the frame depicts social distance and ranges from close-up, via a medium to long-shot. It can suggest intimacy or remoteness (Machin, 2007). The perspective makes the attitude towards the person depicted clear. A distinction can be made between an objective and a subjective perspective (Machin, 2007). The angle of the shot also has an impact on the relationship to the observer (Machin, 2007). The horizontal variation from frontal to the side creates involvement and the vertical angle of high, eye-level or low has an influence on the balance of power. \u201cIf someone is shown at the same level equality is implied\u201d (Machin, 2007, p.115)."
"The rest of the rural population earns a living through fishing, forestry, handicrafts, and the processing of agricultural products. The most common type of settlement, typified by the Javanese village, is a concentration of large thatched-roof houses on stilts. These villages, called kampungs, are surrounded by fruit trees and various kinds of palm trees, which contribute substantially to the family food supply. A kampung, normally provide shelter for about 500 persons and many of the structures blend into neighboring settlements. These appear to be towns of several thousand people, most of who are engaged in agriculture."
"Some people claim that because animals do not have duties or responsibilities in the way humans do, they are not deserving of the same protection. However, some humans have no responsibilities or duties, such as babies, the mentally ill, or very infirm, yet they are not stripped of their rights in this way. Indeed, such individuals are usually considered more deserving of protection, not less. Others argue that the potential benefit to human society justifies experiments on animals."
"In the document \u201cPolitical cartoon\u201d, It is about the protection of Asians and how America should be equal to all men; it points out that America is supposed be equal to all men, the Irish and the German are just like any other Chinese in America, they are all immigrants, it should be fair. This document created in 1871 it correlates to the time when there was a lot of violence towards Chinese people and when 18 Chinese were killed. This document was created for the people as an advertisement for anti-Chinese violence and it has the irony of Irish and German immigrants showing violence to Chinese immigrants."
"Youth health problem- a child with persistent ear infection can have a great deal of problems in language and speech development. In this infection continue, there will be fluids in the ear and this will effect on the kid\u2019s hearing. This affects how a kid will process the language and thus lead to postponed language and speech skills acquisition."
"Taylor (132) maintains that animal experimentation has helped in unearthing new drugs that have helped to ease the suffering of humans from disease that was once witnessed in the past. Blakemore support Taylors point by indicating that vaccines for polio and cervical cancer, insulin, antibiotics, heart-bypass surgery, among others were all advances that were achieved through animal testing. For a patient to receive therapy or treatment, it has to be known that this originated from an arduous medical research involving animals."
"Moreover, young parents, possible teen parents may not have all the information to provide first aid to their new born in emergency situations or may even freak out over general issues such as a fever. The app can help with many first aid situation and even clear their doubts about what to do when their infant has a fever."
"Most of the teachers do not know sign language this lead to misunderstanding between teacher and leaners as this communication is the best way for teaching and learning in both formal and informal context. This need enough support for learners. Teachers has the responsivity to teach learners about barriers may experience like language, curriculum and classroom practice."
"Many of which have, since then, adopted the same values of Catholics. It was clear to understand that they accepted the conversion only for protection and not as a pure religion. (Roman Catholic, Wikipedia. org) The pasyon is a Tagalog prayer book introduced by the missionaries and one of the tactics used for evangelism. Because of that, there is be a possibility that if natives refuse to follow the Spaniards, it could be an act of revolt of their new religion since they still have the faith of the former beliefs and since the conversion was only forced. However, these evidences are not strong enough to support the culture as the main factor that triggers different understanding on the reading."
"I was not supposed to show off my current equal status or like the god who is so sacred that every one should acknowledge their guilt and mistake regretfully when facing him. I just wanna get my hamburger! I just wanna find a corner to finish that! Isn\u2019t it strange? Under the social circumstance at that time, the one who should feel sorry about causing the predicament is the black but not the white! I do think it demonstrated the white people they held a classic characteristic not guilty, but cowardice. They dare not admit the historical mistake."
"They are always open, upfront, and honest with me that I have never felt like a little helpless child. They have instilled a sense of self-responsibility in me from a young age and gave me the freedom to make my own decisions and learn from my mistakes. However, this is not to say that they are lax or that they spoil me. It is just that their manner of discipline involves talking to me rather than at me. If people felt happy, renewed, and enriched because of an ego booster\u2019s presence in their lives, they will feel the complete opposite when they touch base with an ego buster."
"African Americans make up over twelve percent of the population of the United States yet this race has a significantly higher mortality rate that any other group. Based on their findings regarding life expectancy, The\u00a0Center for Disease Control and Prevention insists that on average the Caucasian population in the United States life expectancy exceeds that of the African American population by almost five and a half years. Moreover, the same source states that deaths due to heart disease were 31% higher in black American than their white counterparts (CDC, 2005)."
"As one encounters a relative enhancement that joy is in respect to social experience correlations with those having less cash, achievement, knowledge, esteem, or favorable luck will in general deliver joy while correlations with those having a greater amount of these prized credits will in general create despondency. Myers presumes that wellbeing is found in the reestablishment of taught ways of life submitted connections and the giving and getting of acknowledgment. Not another handy solution book, however a calm sees what\u2019s thought about the idea of human joy. Twenty-five outlines not seen. In my opinion This book influenced me by showing me the way people really look at the world, the surveys and how he helped many people just by looking out for them."
"Judith Jarvis Thomson presents the following hypothesis:[3] a woman becomes pregnant and then learns that she has a cardiac condition that will cause her death if the pregnancy continues. Let us grant the foetus personhood, with a right to life. Obviously the mother too has a right to life, so how can we decide who\u2019s right to life is greater? A way of answering this question could be to say that an abortion is an act of aggression with the sole intention to kill. Whereas to do nothing would not be an attempt by anyone to murder the mother, rather to just let her die."
"They also have safe havens where women of domestic violence can enter when leaving there abusers. These shelters are not listed and they are usually known to women by word of mouth or a referral from a hospital or social workers who have the resources to help those looking to get out. The family support for those that are experiencing domestic violence is better than it was in the past when family members would turn a blind eye or tell them to stick it out cause it will get better. Domestic abuse is no longer the hidden secret that it once was. Domestic violence is a trend that has been around for years, but unlike in the past it is no longer a hidden secret and women and men have resources that they can go to so that they can receive help. The elderly population no longer has to hide the fact that they too are victims of domestic violence. Domestic violence affects everyone in a family not just the victim. It causes harm to the children because they are witnessing the abuse and it can cause them to become abusers themselves. With the laws that are put in place for domestic abuse and the many shelters that are available for the victim\u2019s domestic abuse should be a trend that will decline, but that is not likely to happen because for every two people that report domestic abuse there will be someone who does not report it. Love is not pain; no one deserves to be beaten in the name of love. If you or someone you know is in a domestic violent relationship please encourage them to get help before it\u2019s to late."
"Also the basis of the woman rejecting to lease her house to the man is because of the prejudiced notion that African Americans are a savage and wild people. This idea is completely discredited by the ironical fact that throughout the poem the man retains better manners and vocabulary than the woman, using words such as \u201cspectroscopic\u201d and \u201crancid\u201d, whereas she does not know what West African Sepia is and is inconsiderate in her inquiries. Using irony in this manner, Soyinka proves how absurd it is to judge the intellect or character of a man depending on the color of his skin only."
"All children are individuals first, each with a unique profile of abilities. All planning starts with observing children in order to understand and consider their interests, development and learning. I will make systematic observations and assessments of each child\u2019s achievements ,interests and learning styles. I will use these observations and assessments to identify learning priorities and plan relevant and motivating learning experiences for each child that I care for. I will match their observations to the expectations of the development matters principles."
"However, after the boom of the California Gold Rush ended in 1855, the country fell into a landslide of economic downturn. As gold and prosperity diminished, so did the respect that Americans nativists held for the Chinese. Many Native-born Americans were unable to find employment that sufficiently paid enough to support their families, however, at the same time many of such were unwilling to work unfair hours for low wages. Because of this, many companies and employers looked towards hiring Chinese immigrants, who were mostly unaware of acceptable wages and labor laws."
"If his plan to fight \u201ctooth for tooth,\u201d then the turn of events in the United States would have been different, with the black people being probably shot down for terrorism and mayhem. Then, that would have ended the black American\u2019s struggle for liberty and independence. As if Malcolm X\u2019s call to arms and racist statements were not enough, he called for the return of American Africans to their home countries and the establishment of a black republic within the United States which this writer believes could have altered the course of American history."
"Forcing students to complete 24 hours of community service in high school in order to graduate is a very controversial issue. Both sides have solid arguments about why community service should or should not be forced upon students. Community service is a wonderful thing that everyone should be required to do at some point in their life, but are high school students mature and responsible enough to take on community service projects at this stage in their life?"
"The thesis of \u201cWhy Race Class and Gender Still Matter\u201d is that developing knowledge of how the progressively universal center of society effects the configuration of race, class, and gender interactions will inspire inclusive outlooks in the United States. The author\u2019s language ability is voice-intimidating. The author uses very advanced language. Specific words I found difficult to understand were matrix, salient, domination, and framework. The author provides evidence when talking about Hurricane Katrina and the damage that hurricane did. However, most statements are not backed up with evidence of studies or statistics. The author employs the logic of problematic."
"Despite the potential that the United States saw for a Reconstruction of the way of living in the country, key events catalyzed the digression of thoughts of equality in the 1870s. Democrats were steadily regaining control of the South, as the already-weak Republican presence in region only became weaker as northerners lost interest in Reconstruction. The Depression of 1873, along with continued pressure from the Ku Klux Klan, drove most white Unionists, carpetbaggers, and \u201cscalawags\u201d out of the South by the mid-1870s, leaving blacks alone to fight for radical legislation. By the end of the decade, the fight was over, and equality for freedmen remained an unsolved matter."
"For years of being considered unproductive (unless you count five children, which no one does. For years of being viewed as a parasite, living off a man\u2026 For years of caring for five children and a big house and constantly being asked when I\u2019m going to work. \u201d (Hekker 390-91). Hekkers proves statistical evidence that housewives are on the slope to extinction and feels taken for granted from her husband and others. Instead of Hekker moving forward and deciding to get a career, she rather be a full-time \u201cstay-at-home\u201d mom. Edelman has a more modern viewpoint as a housewife rather than traditional."
"Clearing the forest considerably increases the surface run- off from rainfall, chiefly because a greater amount of the rain reaches the ground due to a lack of vegetation which would suck up the excess rainfall. In tropical regions where the forests are dense, flooding is not a serious problem because there is vegetation to absorb the rainfall. A problem occurs in areas where there is little rainfall. In order to avoid the disastrous effects of flooding, it is important that tropical forests remain dense and lush."
"He said it was not alright to suffer in silence and invoked the Koran, the Muslim bible, as the source of his enlightenment. He appealed even to criminal elements to be prepared for a possible encounter against the whites. He told them to be in the forefront of the struggle and drew the loudest cheers. Malcolm X was the opposite of Dr. Luther King, who espoused peace. If King was a rebel, X was a revolutionary who hated white Americans, no matter who they were. They had only two similarities, or maybe three."
"Define the term sensitive periods and link them appropriately to the child\u2019s first stage of development. Explain how you would support these sensitive periods during this first crucial stage. In this essay I will define the term sensitive periods linking it with stage of development, I will also outline the importance of these periods , the consequences of not recognising it, and finally how we can support children in this crucial time. \u201cA sensitive periods refers to a special sensibility which a creature in its infantile state, while it is still in a process of evolution\u201d."
"The way Steinbeck doesn\u2019t give Curley\u2019s wife a name dehumanises her and makes her feel lonely. Another quote goes to Crooks\u2019 past and how things in those days were the same, yet he didn\u2019t know. \u201cI ain\u2019t a Southern Negro\u2026 I was born right here in California\u2026 The white kids come to place at our place, an\u2019 sometimes I went to play with them\u2026 My ol\u2019 man didn\u2019t like that. I never knew till long later why he didn\u2019t like that. But I know now. \u201d Racism was a big issue in those days and that\u2019s why Crook\u2019s dad didn\u2019t like him mixing with the other white kids."
"For example, the idea of white superiority and racism may have been implied in the American comedy \u201cFriends\u201d, where the entire cast are white people. Secondly, true to the Herd Mentality, societal pressures cause individuals to succumb other people\u2019s prejudices. Media and other people in our lives shape the way we think. In order to conform to society and thus \u2018fit in\u2019, individuals would begin to formulate personal opinions based on the information obtained from social circles, family and of course, the media."
"The Ewells who are despised by the Maycomb community as \u2018white trash\u2019 are poor, uneducated, crude and dirty and would most keenly feel the threat of the Blacks. They are uncertain of their position in society, thus they assert prejudice on Blacks to make themselves feel more superior. Due to their fear of racial disturbance, they want to get rid of the Blacks, so they choose Tom Robinson to be charged with rape, a crime he does not commit. During the trial, Tom says he feels sorry for Mayella. Mr Gilmer, Mayella\u2019s defendant, picks up on the point and states hastily:"
"The practice of abortion is legal in the United States. Abortion law has many sources-constitutions, legislative statues, administrative regulations, and court decisions. The foundation of abortion law is the United States Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court (McBride, 2008). Constitutional law does not directly regulate abortion, but it sets limits on the powers of the states and the federal government to regulate abortion. The authority to regulate abortion has been reserved to the states by the Constitution because Article I, which covers the legislative branch."
"In recent years, the climate on Earth has changed significantly: some countries suffer from anomalous heat, others from too harsh and snowy winters, unusual for those places. Ecologists unanimously talk about global climate alterations which cause global warming. These alterations include an increase in the average annual global temperature causing melting of glaciers, and an increase in the level of the World Ocean. There is also an unbalance of all natural systems, which leads to a change in the regime of precipitation, temperature anomalies and an increase in the frequency of extreme events such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts."
"Domestic violence is the leading cause of injury to women\u2014more than car accidents, muggings, and rapes combined. The CDC reports that 15 million children are abused every year. Recently, the NFL has been under a lot of scrutiny for their domestic violence policy. There are as many opinions as there are teams on how they should react. To me, that is the problem. See, reaction means to have an action performed in response to a situation. However, action stands for the fact or process of doing something, typically to achieve an aim."
"Another way to improve a child\u2019s behaviour is through communications. Parents who communicate more with their children starting from young will decrease the chances of children doing rebellious things. Parents who often communicate with their children are able to tell his or her problems. Therefore, these children will not get any wrong advice from their peers or outsiders."
"It does not address the issue of crime in society. There will always be criminals who commit heinous crimes for personal pleasure. Yet 20% of the U.S. prison population involves people who have been locked up because of a drug offense. People who are in prison are reported statistically under the most violent offense from their conviction. Its groups people with felony murder convictions with those who do not even commit the crime, like participating in a robbery where someone dies, but they did not pull the trigger.8. It creates the possibility of sentencing children to death row. George Stinney was wrongly convicted of murder in 1944 in his hometown of Alcolu. At the time of his execution, he was only 14 years old. He was convicted in less than 10 minutes, in a 1-day trial, by a jury that was all-white. Stinney had been accused of killing two white girls, ages 11 and 7, and supposedly confessed to the crime, though no record of the confession was every found. Stinney was denied appeal and electrocuted. Although the Supreme Court ruled in March 2005 that the death penalty for anyone under the age of 18 is cruel and unusual punishment, other countries are not bound by such a ruling. It eliminates the possibility of rehabilitation. There are criminals who prefer to live outside of the rules that society sets. These individuals may never be rehabilitated. The death penalty eliminates that possibility from the equation. Instead of allowing individuals an opportunity to make amends in some way, it automatically assumes that nothing can be done about that person. It suggests that society discards people based on their willingness to follow the rules, especially in nations where non-violent offenses qualify for capital punishment."
"Furthermore, Malay culture has been centre of attraction in his drawing, and this culture that can be learns from most of his cartoons. As example below, Lat\u2019s describes his childhood experience when they have to learn how to solat or pray with all the games equipment is hidden beneath their clothes and songkok. The cover blown up definitely, but its shows that no matter what they do, religion and knowledge are crucial, and it should be on the top of the list. Another thing we can examine is what is the game they always playing back in village, when all the hidden things was discovered. Lat\u2019s drawing shows slingshots, gasing, batu seremban and marble are rolling out from their pockets. These are all popular games back in village in those days, in his childhood era. All these elements of traditional Malay culture is connected closely and very important that we can search just by looking at his drawing."
"Along with other ethnic immigrants, the Filipinos suffered discrimination (Hoh). This discrimination of Filipinos may be attributed to \u201cethnic difference, economic hardships and language barriers\u201d (Hoh). As a response, there were agricultural workers who went on a union strike in 1924 (Vera Cruz cited in Garchitorena, p. 1). In addition to this, Carlos Bulosan, a renowned Filipino"
"\u201cIt is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. \u201d This opening line summarizes the character\u2019s intentions throughout the story. Pride and Prejudice is set in a time where marriage defines one\u2019s value, so the entire plot revolves around the sacred union. From cover to cover, the idea of marriage corresponding with happiness dictates the actions of every character. Because of the culture of the day, every Bennett sister is expected to marry and settle into a higher class family than her own."
"It is true that the ways the parents raise their children will decide how well the children grow, especially the mothers who impact their children the most. There is no right or wrong in how a mother takes care of her children. All of them want the best for their children. The only difference is the level of intensity in how to raise a child. In Why Chinese Mothers Are Superior, Amy Chua, a professor at Yale Law School believes that the ways Chinese mothers raise their children are the most effective ways."
"Current practice focus on specialty and acute care only and a shift in practice to deliver more primary care and community care services is essential to improve the quality of nursing care and address the growing need of care in these areas. Involvement of nurses in patient care substantially improves the quality of care and reduces medical errors. A study conducted by RWJF at John Hopkins University has found significant reduction in blood stream infection can be achieved by nurses leading the infection control effort. INQRI, 2010b; Marsteller et al. , 2010). We need to have consistent nursing practice laws which will enable nurses to practice at the full extent of their education and training. Nursing Leadership The great shift in education and practice level of nurses that reach across disciplines require a great amount of mutual respect, team work, collaboration and communication. Today we have very limited participation from the nursing community in hospital boards when compared with other health care professionals (6% when physicians accounts for 20%)."
"This may be majorly due to environmental and social factors that may factor in to invalidate the findings. 1. 9 The Scope of the Study The study primarily focused on the impact of alcoholism on family welfare, a case study of Suneka division, Kisii south district, Nyanza province in Kenya. The study was based on a sample of 30 respondents and was conducted between the months of February and March 2009. 7 1. 10 Conceptual Framework ALCOHOLISM FAMILY WELFARE FAMILY HEALTH AND SAFETY MARRIAGE STABILITY FAMILY ECONOMY ALCOHOLISM RESPONSIBILITY WITHDRAWAL LEGAL IMPLICATIONS Fig."
"However, it gave me the opportunity to live life by myself as Ryan, instead of Amanda\u2018s little brother. Since the beginning, I got stuck with a teacher that she had had. Being four years younger than my sibling made the memory of Amanda, being the bright student that she is. easier for my teachers to recall. Every September for twelve years I was greeted by all of my teachers with the same \u201cOh you\u2019re Amanda\u2019s little brother."
"The deterrent is not effective so stop throwing the money away by continuing with capital punishment. The vast majority of homicides are spontaneous and domestic, many even know their killer personally. Many criminals also realize that only about 50% of people sentenced to the death penalty actually receive the punishment. From January to April of 2019, 14 people have received the death penalty, three have been executed, six have stayed, four have been rescheduled, and one has not reached the date yet. That means nearly 46% of 2019\u2019s prosecuted persons have been executed. This does not strike any fear into the heart or mind of these people that are committing these horrid crimes. The death penalty has been active and ongoing for centuries. Is it time to put the ancient method of death to a halt? Is the price we pay to complete the execution really worth it? Many people face the death penalty but the execution is unlikely. Taxpayers are sending their money to the government to fund this method and for its price, it is not effective. Yes, the person will be executed but the crimes are still being committed by other criminals. The threat of death does not strike fear into these individuals. So why do we continue to pay for it?"
"The use of technology can either have a positive effect or a negative effect depending on the quality of the content. Given that quality of content is important, the quantity is just as relevant as well. Therefore, the relationship between these two play a huge role in the outcomes of early childhood. With this taken into consideration, another important point to reflect on is what are they watching and what are they learning?"
"With her strong stance on immigration, Bharati Mukherjee makes it clear in what she believes in: each immigrant has their own story and migrates to a new country for a variety of different reasons, the process of moving to a new place and adapting to a new environment can be somewhat of a struggle for some and a completely opposite feeling for others, and idea that everyone is immigrants is false and never was and never will be the case."
"A parent is abusive to one of your colleagues, and may show aggressiveness. In my setting, the line manager would be called to deal with the situation, by passing word of mouth, quickly and efficiently \u2018down the line\u2019 so, that the member of staff in question is not left by themselves to deal with the irate parent."
"Gore explains that his father would always find excuses to continue growing tobacco after the surgeon general\u2019s warning until the death of his close friend. This is just like people coming up with reasons to avoid paying attention to global warming situation. Gore also includes information about his son when he was hit by a car and was put into critical condition. This would relate to the majority of the audience who has children themselves and at the same time show everyone that he has tragedies in his life just like every other ordinary person does. Another important part included through the little movies, possibly the most important little movie because it contained main emphasis on the topic, was how he became interested in global warming. He informed his viewers that his interest was jump started by an image, an image shown to him in college by a favored professor. He then explains that this college professor was also a talented scientist who would send weather balloons over the pacific in order to get statistics of his own. The professor recorded his findings and shared them with his classmates, all of which Al Gore absorbed like a sponge and became interested."
"Students who show little to no effort are giving teachers much needed feedback. When a student likes their teacher, the student will work harder to impress their teacher. When learning gets the student excited, curious or intrigued then the student will put out more effort. This is a prime example of how some students work harder in one class than another because the student simply enjoys that class as well as the teacher more than the uninteresting class and teacher. It is imperative teachers invest in students who are not putting forth great effort. In a study of more than 1,800 children from poverty, school engagement was a key factor in whether the student stayed in school (Finn & Rock, 1997)."
"Two people must have romance between them to be defined as lovers but friendship can be maintained without any romantic inclinations. 2b) There is a great difference between friends and relatives. We are not fortunate enough to choose our relatives. We have to be content with relatives who have been bestowed to us by faith. But friends are those people whom we choose. They are the people with whom we love to spend our time. They are not attached to us by birth but are those with whom we naturally gelled and got interested in when we grew older."
"Dr. Omalu placed the brain in a bucket of formaldehyde until the brain hardened enough to slice. Once he was able to get these slices he took the brain slices to the lab at University of Pittsburg where he had just finished his neuropathology training and knew the technicians and their particular expertise. Dr. Omalu picked Jonette Werley to assist him with the processing of the brain. Jonette Werley was to shave each block of the brain that Dr. Omalu brought to her into microscopic sliver, mount them onto glass slides and stain them with the antibodies requested by Dr. Omalu. The stains are to bring any unusual patters of cells into view. (Concussion pg108)"
"Nash offers in his book a historical account with a timeline of the objective facts and events during and briefly after the revolution, but also a pertinent theory with respect to the inherent concept of race within the American civilization. He lies out and analyzes a block of data as well as authentic testimonies and documents of the time. It is obvious that he insists more on opinions and declarations from the time of the revolution, rather than on mere facts. Thus, he bases his analysis on the concepts and ideologies which circulated at the time."
"It is also reported that constant bullying discourages teens from continuing receiving an education. Nora & Cabrera, (1996) found that Hispanics reported the lowest college enrollment rates as well as the highest dropout rates. The following paper will explore the social problem of racism and how it can be explained by a biological and sociological perspective. Additionally, I will give two interventions that target the social problem I am discussing."
"On February 14, 2018, Nikolas Cruz opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School located in Parkland Florida. He murdered seventeen people and injured another seventeen. Florida is a death penalty state but there are some conflicts that raise concern about this specific case. Many feel Cruz deserves the death penalty, but others believe his mental disorders should excuse him because he does not know any better. Although there are suspicions about Nikolas Cruz\u2019s mental state, he should be given the death penalty."
"The top level management must be aware about misperception happening in the company. They are the decision makers of the company, and therefore they can do a number of things to increase accuracy. They must be aware of the common misperception in their organization so that they would be able to avoid it or compensate for them. There is no formula that will eliminate misperception or tell what image is correct (Jervis, 1977). Therefore, they could develop policies, provide trainings, and discourage stereotyping thoughts, or stop discrimination. In the case, Gilman being the vice president of marketing at Hy Dairies, Inc. did not make any efforts to know about the perspective of Rochelle. This shows that he did what he thought was correct rather than thinking from the perspective of the employee. This problem occurred also because they did not know each other very well. The solution would be to conduct outing once in a while so that their employees do not hesitate to open up if any problem occurs."
"In 2017, the calculated median pay of HR management was around $110,00+ per year and $52.90+ per hour. HR managers are estimated to work about 40 hours per week. According to a site I found, the calculated amount of HR employment in Indiana is about 2,200. The annual wage in Indiana was calculated as $102,650 and the hourly wage was calculated as $49.35. To be more exact, in Northern Indiana, the amount of employment is 130 with an estimated annual mean wage of $95,730. All of the numbers provided were calculated in 2017 by a site I will have cited in my works cited page. According to a site I already spoke about, \u201cemployment of human resources managers is projected to grow 9 percent from 2016 to 2026.\u201d (\u201cBureau of Labor Statistics\u201d)"
"The tone is completely contrasting in these poems. \u201cUpon My Son Samuel\u2026 \u201d keeps a somber and pleading tone as the speaker is praying to God to save her son. It\u2019s beseeching and presents a desperate mother who is standing strong due to her complete faith in God. From the lines \u201c\u2026 if thou shalt spare me a space, That I again may see his face\u201d we can also see that she although she feels resigned and helpless, she is still hopeful for her son\u2019s return. \u201cA Parental Ode\u2026 \u201d has a whimsical tone and but can also be interpreted in different ways."
"Realism shifted literature to a way of describe life as it actually is instead of trying to present an idealized or romantic image. It was an objective style that offered detached perspectives on the everyday lives of the middle-class, working-class and the poor. This style worked well for describing the struggles of the period. Baym et al. (2008) describe W. D. Howells as the \u201cchief American advocate\u201d of realism (p. 6). Mark Twain, Henry James, Edith Wharton, and others also joined in this movement as well as some distinguished African American writers such as W. E."
"Now, that I was a regent for the young king, Thutmose III, I was not the Great King\u2019s Wife anymore; however, I was still the Great Wife of Amen. I felt it was my duty to teach Thutmose III about whom to trust, who not to trust, and how to become a great king. By doing this, I felt determined to keep my family bloodline alive. Anyway, as the God\u2019s Wife, I had to be there for the rituals to guide Thutmose III, because he did not know how to do them. So, this allowed me to have some kingly powers and control Thutmose III, as my mother did before me. I acted like a king, but not said to be. When Thutmose III was nine or ten years old, I became the co-king of Egypt."
"In plays, the audience can only know what the actors are saying and doing \u2013 they cannot have access to their thoughts. This means the narrator of this novella is omniscient (all knowing), but to a rather limited degree. Still, there might be more to Steinbeck\u2019s choice of a \u201climited omniscient\u201d narrator. The limited omniscient third person narrator almost seems to mirror the characters of the play; in this hard-hitting, straight-shooting story, it simply wouldn\u2019t be fitting to have a narrator gushing about how everyone feels all the time."
"The laws make it clear that physical discipline is not a necessary nor acceptable part of parenting as it undermines a child\u2019s feelings of safety, but in many cultures discipline provides a secure environment for both children and adults and ensures positive outcomes as children grow up. According to section 59 of the New Zealand Crimes Act, the use of force for correction is strictly forbidden. New Zealand is among a growing number of countries, around the world, having a legal ban on the use of physical punishment of children. However, this law clashes with some cultural disciplinary procedures."
"Benedick and Beatrice are tricked into confessing their love for each other. Dogberry, a Constable who is a master of malapropisms, discovers the evil trickery of the villain, Don John. In the end, Don John runs away and everyone else joins in a dance celebrating the marriages of the two couples. As You Like It It is a pastoral comedy by William Shakespeare believed to have been written in 1599 or early 1600 . The play features one of Shakespeare\u2019s most famous and oft-quoted speeches The play remains a favorite among audiences and has been adapted for radio, film, and musical theatre."
"Through stories, he analyzes the Founding Fathers personality, their flaws, and their strength. This makes the Founding Fathers more relatable to the reader and makes it easier for the reader to understand why they did what they did. Joseph J. Ellis argues that the government built today was rooted by the close relationship that these men have formed. Which is why Ellis calls his book \u201cFounding Brothers\u201d, instead to Founding Fathers which goes to reflects on how intimate they were. Their relationship was held by their united convictions that Union must be preserved."
"There are many different arguments against the death penalty, and some of these come from law enforcement. Recent polls of police chiefs in various areas of the country indicate that a large majority of them believe that the death penalty is no deterrent to violent crime. It ranks last on their lists of how they should go about reducing violent crime, and studies have shown that it is no better at reducing crime than the possibility of life in prison without any chance of parole (Cook, 1999). This is interesting, in the face of the argument that the death penalty reduces the amount of violent crimes that are committed. Studies have also shown that, contrary to the popular opinion that the death penalty brings closure, most people do not feel that watching someone else die helps them to move on in any way (Cassell & Bedau, 2005). Sometimes it seems to profane the name of the lost loved one by associating yet another death with it. The death of the loved one is painful enough without adding to it (Cook, 1999)."
"To begin, President Barack Obama once said, \u201cWhat makes someone American isn\u2019t just blood or birth but allegiance to our founding principles and faith in the idea that anyone- can write the next chapter of our story.\u201d America is built on immigration, it\u2019s one of our founding principles. Obama has also stated \u201cUnless you\u2019re a Native American, you came from someplace else.\u201d Being an American doesn\u2019t mean that you have to be born here or it is not by blood but it\u2019s having the belief that our country is a place of freedom and equality."
"Hawthorne\u2019s behavior of his aunts in real life can be seen from side to side his narrator\u2019s move toward to Hepzibah, for example. He often teasingly tease his aunts about their single status just as the narrator mocks Hepzibah. Yet Hawthorne\u2019s come within reach of to such women, though tongue in cheek, is understanding as well. Women often fall wounded to alarming patriarchies, and even though his heroines give the feeling powerless, Hawthorne\u2019s women lead small revolutions within their own family next to influential male figures that change their community and, debatably, the entire American culture. though Hawthorne has often been criticize for his vagueness about women\u2019s public roles in society he give somebody a talking to them for writing fiction that he careful middling and pass judgment on activists for women\u2019s rights such as Margaret Fuller. He is not a conservative in his fiction when it comes to women\u2019s issues. Making female protagonists central figures in his fiction alone substantiates his pioneering imagination as an artist since dynamic fictional female characters were rare in early American fiction. The bonds between age band of women in Hawthorne\u2019s fiction are symbols which direct future generations of heroines to develop an artistic emotional retort that will lead to the fruition of their full possible as women."
"Slowly losing interest in her sister\u2019s book, Alice catches sight of a white rabbit. However, he is not merely a rabbit; he will be the \u201cWhite Rabbit,\u201d a major character in the novel. In this first paragraph, then, we learn about the protagonist, Alice, her age, her temperament, and the setting and the mood of the story. In a dream, Alice has escaped from the dull and boring and prosaic world of adulthood a world of dull prose and picture less experiences; she has entered what seems to be a confusing, but perpetual springtime of physical, if often terrifying, immediacy. The White Rabbit wears a waistcoat, walks upright, speaks English, and is worrying over the time on his pocket watch. Alice follows him simply because she is very curious about him. And very soon she finds herself falling down a deep tunnel. For a few minutes, she is frightened; the experience of falling disorients her. Soon, however, she realizes that she is not falling fast; instead, she is falling in a slow, almost floating descent."
"Friendship can exist between the same sex man-man, woman-woman or opposite sex man-woman. It transcends age and could subsist between even an old man and a small boy. Human beings also establish friendship with their pet animals such as cats, dogs, horses, doves and parrots. Friendship also can be felt in familial relationship between father and son, mother and daughter, husband and wife and also brother and sister.Yet, more than friendship, love is the binding force in familial relationship."
"The theoretical construct that Sony Company Entertainment incorporates is based on the apprehension to the international markets that the house concentrates on adaptability that secures a keeping on the demographic both offline and online. The steadfast geographic locations. specifically in markets that catered to the merchandise demographics interets nowadayss more a direct involvement to the game rubrics and proficient online handiness. Furthermore. the Sony PlayStation contrasts with old game developer\u2019s perceptual experience on how Sony\u2019s selling scheme for the on-line drama to inculcate advertisement support suitably ( Porter. 2004:89 ) ."
"Working on stereotyping, discrimination and prejudice has broadened our knowledge on the many challenges people face as a result of this issue. With our study objectives being; Identifying why people stereotype, discriminate and prejudice against others in the society. Examining the sources of stereotype, discriminate and prejudice in the society. Recognizing the role of stereotyping, discrimination and prejudice in tribal conflicts. Discovering strategies for dealing with stereotyping, discrimination and prejudice related situations. We have being able to conclude our findings based on the objectives. 4.1 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS"
"Heavy drinking can lead to teen pregnancy. Teachers in a health course for teens need to explain clearly how different the brain is when a teen drink heavily. Weekend drinking contests are frequent for some teens. The teenage brain seems to be less reactive to alcohol\u2019s short-term effects. Yet, for teens, alcohol impairs the memory system in the hippocampus and severely limits the ability of the frontal lobes to carry out thoughtful and logical thinking. \u2018Without mature frontal lobes, young people are less able to weigh negatives consequences and inhibit impulsive behavior like binge drinking. Binge drinking can lead to unsafe sex and unwanted pregnancy\u2019 (Paturel, 2011/12, pp. 24 and 26)."
"In 1869 Canada passed a law which banned abortion with a penalty of life in prison. Physicians, not citizens led the battle against abortion in England, the US and Canada. They were trying to protect women\u2019s health but it only resulted in illegal and unsafe abortion practices. If the right to abortion is taken away then it is inevitable that history will repeat itself. Especially in today\u2019s world, if a woman wanted an abortion that badly she would find someone to do it illegally and unsafely."
"Religion helped dull the pain that the African American men and women slaves faced every day. Some slaves believed in God because they needed something to believe in, while others didn\u2019t believe or hated God because they did not understand why he would let them suffer. In \u201cIncidents in the Life of a Slave Girl\u201d, the whites hire a preacher to teach the sermons. The preacher teaches the slaves the importance to obedient to their master. Linda was appalled at this message and could not believe what she was hearing. Elizabeth implemented her religion daily and even enjoyed preaching to others. Many communities did not accept her because she was a woman. Instead, she began to hold prayer meetings in homes and continued this practice for many years, despite strong church opposition. Another activist like this is Sojourner Truth. After gaining her freedom Sojourner became a Christian and believed that God was urging her to abolish slavery and have equal rights for all (Washington 7). Her most famous speech was \u201cAint I A Woman\u201d which pointed out the discrimination that she experienced as a black woman. Also, Sojourner was the first black woman to sue a white man in court and win the case."
"Writing a thank you letter is an important skill to learn. Constructing an effective letter, with good grammar and an important message is a valuable skill to have, and one that is rarely taught in these days of rapid texting and instant messaging. Next, saying \u2018please\u2019 and \u2018thank you\u2019 to the people we deal\u00a0with when we want or need something is basic good manners."
"Throughout history the lives of the people in the working class have not always been easy. People always work hard to earn money and support their families; however, people don\u2019t always work in a suitable working area. The term \u201cBlue Collar\u201d is jobs that require manual labor from people. The problem with these kinds of jobs is that the places the people work in can be extremely unsanitary and may cause a bad working environment for the people in it."
"Adichie is addressing the challenge of belonging and identity through the lens of Ifemelu\u2019s African perspective. The American girl triumphs the Nigerian girl in a workplace setting. Ifemelu struggles to figure out how she should look to appeal to the customers at her workplace. Beauty is oppressive, as she goes outside of her comfort zone to please other people. Readers get a sense that she becomes aware of the difference in cultural beauty norms within America and Nigeria."
"As I move into this next phase of college life, I am so grateful that I have family who believes in me and has taught me to believe in myself at all times. My family has had a huge impact on my life and have motivated me to continually strive for success."
"Capital punishment is a punishment creates fear, especially in the minds of sane persons. Haag (2003) in his article On Deterrence and Death Penalty, people refrain from dangerous and harmful acts because of inchoate, vague, habitual, and most importantly preconscious fear (Haag 72). Everyone fears death, and most criminals would have a second thought if they were aware their own lives would be on the line. There are not so many justifications and evidence of death penalty to effectively deter crime than the usual long term imprisonment. The countries or states with the capital punishment has no lower rates of crime or rates of murder than those countries and states without those laws. On the other hand, the states or countries that campaign against capital punishment have not shown any significant deviation in the rates of murder or crime. The indicates that capital punishment has no defined deterrent impact. Claims that the executions dissuade particular number of murders have been discredited thoroughly by the researches of social sciences. In fact people do commit murder widely in the heat of passion basically under drug or alcohol influence, or because of mental illness, without thinking about the implications of the act."
"As I have pointed out, gun control legislation has only a marginal effect. I think that more headway in lowering handgun related crimes could be made through education. This exact point is made by Barry Goldwater: Gun education, in fact, can actually reduce lawlessness in a community, as was demonstrated in an experiment conducted in Highland Park Michigan. City police launched a program to instruct merchants in the use of handguns. The idea was to help them protect themselves and their businesses from robbers, and it was given wide publicity. The store-robbery rate dropped from an average of 1.5 a day to none in four months. (186)"
"In today\u2019s society every time a person turns on the television, goes on a computer, turns on a radio, passes a billboard, or picks up a newspaper that person is bombarded with debates. There are many different debates and each debate with two parties both of which have two very different and sometimes conversational opinions. Everywhere a person looks they are faced with arguments such as president Obama\u2019s affordable healthcare act, gay rights, the matters of the death penalty being legalized or illegalized in all states, and many more."
"Missing a clue like that can cost you a sale. 4. Exhibits patience. Without patience, you may make early concessions just to get the process moving\u2014especially if you\u2019re negotiating with a larger company. \u201cTheir sales process takes a lot longer than other small businesses or consumers,\u201d says Robertson. But making the right deal, rather than a swift one, will be better for your company. 5. Understands the negotiating process. Salespeople must understand that there\u2019s a beginning, middle and end to the sales process, and that once the relationship begins, everything you do afterward either adds value or takes away value. So remain positive, continue to be responsive, and don\u2019t let the customer fall off your radar."
"Fletcher Henderson was a very successful commercial jazz artist in the 1920s. He was a pianist, arranger, composer, and bandleader and was an important figure in the production of big jazz bands and swing music which ultimately made him the uncrowned king of swing (NPR, 2007). He wrote several pieces of music for Benny Goodman which allowed Goodman to gain the title of \u201cKing of Swing\u201d. This interaction with Fletcher Henderson can be seen as a step in the right direction to end the way in which many musicians see working with other musicians outside of their race and this shows how diversity never hindered or prevented Benny Goodman from creating amazing music with people outside of his race."
"Excessive amounts of greenhouse gases, particularly CO2, introduced into the atmosphere have increased average global temperatures forecasting a number of dire consequences. Impacts from rising sea levels, desertification, and damage from intense super storms like Hurricane Katrina have already created some of the first groups of climate-change refugees and some estimate that number to rise to 150 million by 2050. But even if you\u2019re skeptical of the science, the excessive amount of carbon made has released into the atmosphere has started a dangerous problem with ocean acidification."
"Maylor (2014), recognises the stereotype unconscious or conscious attitudes among teacher\u2019s towards certain ethnic groups, particularly the Black Caribbean leads to teacher racism & institutional racism in schools thereby creating educational inequalities and unequal learning experiences. Black Caribbean children and young people of this ethnic group face humiliations and their abilities are underestimated which suggest that these teacher expectations are overruling these students\u2019 academic talents."
"March 23, 2014 my Maw-Maw passed away at 11:53pm. I was awoken by my father at 6 in the morning telling me my Maw-Maw was no longer with us. I knew that I had to do something to honor her and do something great with my life. August of that same year, I started volunteering in the Nursery at my church. I\u2019ve always loved being in the nursery, I\u2019ve actually always wanted to own a preschool and have baby-sitting jobs on the side. I wasn\u2019t highly involved in the nursery until early 2015. I was doing my job, playing with the toddlers until the door opened up. I did what I normally did, threw my head up, smiled and let out a friend \u201cHIE\u201d. I looked down and saw these two adorable little kids waddle in the doort Both special needs, adopted from Bulgaria Caden, the boy, has down syndrome Avery, the girl, had dwarfism, They were both about the age of five years old but considering their condition, they were in the 2-year-old class. Avery didn\u2019t stay in my class for long because she is super smart. After a few weeks she was moved up to pre-school class. Avery has one of those smiles that makes you smile."
"Capital offenses or we can say that capital crimes are the crimes which results in death penalty. Crime is an obvious part of the society. Death penalty had been practiced by many societies; currently it is practiced by around 58 nations and has been abolished by 97 countries. Execution of criminals i.e. a person who executes criminals by order of the law and the political opponents are being used by all the societies- both to punish the crime and also to suppress the political dissent. In most of the places where capital punishment is practiced it is restricted for various purposes like treason, murder, part of military justice or as espionage. In some of the countries sexual crimes like adultery, sodomy, rape and incest carries death penalty while in Islamic nations religious crimes like apostasy carry death penalty. In most of the countries that uses the death penalty, drug trafficking is also considered as a capital offense. In china, some of the serious cases of corruption as well as human trafficking are suffered for wrong doing by death penalty. In all the cases death penalty is opposed by Amnesty International without exception regardless of forming part of offender, nature of crime or the method which is used by the state to put a prisoner to death. Capital punishment has proved to have good benefits in order to determine the consequences which the criminals deserve in the country. This is required to make certain the moral values and safety of the society, then there will be no need of the expenses that are involved in death penalty."
"Through their avatars and associated profiles, virtual world residents can establish their virtual identities, which can be moulded according to their desires and expectations. When an individual user decides to establish a virtual presence and with it inadvertently assumes a virtual identity, he or she has to make a variety of decisions throughout the process of avatar and profile creation. Similarly to real life identity development, virtual identity construction can described as a cyclical and continuously and iterative process, simultaneously influenced by a variety of individual and global community-based factors within certain environment-specific realities."
"My skills would certainly help me to face the industry as a well-equipped professional. Yet the completeness in being moulded as an engineer would be manifested in its totality, only after a post graduation with a specific area of expertise. It is this context that I came to the conclusion that \u00b7. (give specific names of the instiutute) will be the ideal place for me to take up my further education. I am impressed by the broad and deep experience of your faculty, your modern and flexible curriculum which is tuned to the changing technological times and your links with industry which will give me an education grounded in practice."
"Despite this diversity, Indonesia today has a common bond that united them all into one nation, one language, and one people. Due to this diversity, conflicts are unavoidable. However, the people of Indonesia have been able to overcome their differences. The spirit of musyawarah (to deliberate or confer), mufakat (to agree), and gotong-royong (mutual assistance) that have been instilled by their fore-father have helped in achieving peace between the people\u2019s groups. They have yet find this quality in any other nations of the world. The largest country, both in area and population, in Southeast Asia is the Republic of Indonesia."
"A student needs a supportive and positive environment for fruitful learning which includes quality instructions, guidance, motivation and practical knowledge. The involvement of the stakeholders in the education of children has now gone beyond the walls of the school building and educators to the parents and families. Many families are faced with overwhelming and unpredictable schedules and circumstances while juggling school, sports, family situations, family time, work schedules, and other responsibilities, allowing minimal time to provide support in any one given area (Swap, 1993)."
"Once the goals of the first therapeutic interventions are accomplished, the next step will be assessment. The assessment phase lasts the whole duration of the therapeutic intervention. Within this step the family related cognitions are constantly identified. With the identification of these cognitions, the behaviors and thoughts that result from them can be addressed."
"Squeak also uses her body to help free Sofia from jail, sacrificing her body in efforts to aid Sofia\u2019s circumstances although Sofia knocked her teeth out. This rape in particular \u2013 of a black woman by a white man is depicted, according to Hooks, as a positive force because \u2018even though it acts to reinforce sexist domination of females and racist exploitation\u2019, it is also \u2018a catalyst for positive change\u2019. Not only does the act free Sofia; it also empowers Squeak, as, when Harpo says \u201cI love you, Squeak\u201d (84) she stands up for her own identity by replying \u201cMy name Mary Agnes\u201d (84)."
"It teaches us about enjoying ourselves, having fun, keeping fit and healthy. We also need to share our thoughts and feelings to others. And who can understand better but our parents, siblings, relatives. They will understand us because the same blood running through your veins is the same type of blood passing through theirs. Even if you and your siblings often fight at the end of the day you would eventually make-up again and forget what had happened between the two of you."
"Finally, unmetered access to technology and particular websites may also negatively affect children\u2019s physical activity and thus their overall physical health. Researchers have dedicated a lot of research on this area, with the major concern being that spending more time on digital technology automatically results in reduced time for physical activity. This in turn leads to health problems including obesity, overweight, and cardiac problems among others. Majority of studies suggest that physical health problems among children cannot be solely tied to the time that they spend online and the content they access. Notwithstanding, these factors cannot be completely eliminated in expanding constructive discourse, which would inform policy making and sensitize parents on best practices in assuring the physical well-being of children."
"Bring the spa experience to your clients via a mobile day spa. Mobile spa treatments can be offered in homes, offices or hotels. A mobile spa offers facials, massages, bridal hair and makeup, body treatments, manicures and pedicures. Mobile spas have low startup costs. There are no ongoing costs like those involved in operating a storefront operation such as rent, utilities, maintenance and insurance. Massage therapists, manicurists and hairdressers can run a successful ."
"As a result, it is clear that this has had a lasting impact on American as a whole, and is at the core of the problem with the wealth disparities between African Americans and whites. Deliberate government policies helped create racial segregation. Therefore, policy makers should work towards dismantling the still existing housing segregation through a policy of integration. The fact that before the civil war, African americans and whites lived side by side in the same community, and now over a hundred years later we do not, is staggering."
"Disrespect, however, has exactly the opposite effect. If a leader disrespects his troops, he fails to earn their respect and therefore fails to create devotion to the team. His attitude will be noticed and will become detrimental to morale, which in turn will hurt the combat effectiveness of\u00a0each troop as well as the whole. Because he cannot respect his troops, he will also fail to recognize their true strengths and employ his forces to the best of their respective abilities."
"The media covering police brutality and exposing them on the news became a hit. People nationwide were able to be informed of the latest news within the movement and were able to unite together to fight against the odds. The media was the first method in giving the people knowledge of what was occurring in their community. The Civils Right Movement was a nonviolent movement created to end racial segregation and discrimination towards minorities, made primarily of black people. Police brutality became a problem, as it was widely known across America, because officers were not being punished for their behavior and police brutality lead to more riots."
"African American dance forms such as tap, a combination of African and European influences, gained widespread popularity thanks to dancers such as Bill Robinson and were used by leading White choreographers who often hired African American dancers. Contemporary African American dance is descended from these earlier forms and also draws influence from African and Caribbean dance forms. Groups such as the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater have continued to contribute to the growth of this form. Modern popular dance in America is also greatly influenced by African American dance."
"The present paper mainly explores the mother\u2019s intricacy, questions the blessedness of marriage as an institution, and explores the perceptions as mothers. The purpose is to interpret from a feminist perspective and see whether or not the institution of \u201cmotherhood\u201d can ultimately give power to women to be noticeable in vital areas of human deeds. Many African authors have been dealt with extensively with the notion of motherhood. Catherine Obianuju Acholunu has coined the term \u2018Mothers\u2019 as an alternative to Western feminism."
"One-career families usually have the mother staying at home, and this is very beneficial to the children because they will always have someone to can go to once they reach home after school.\u00a0 Homemakers have unlimited time to help their children with their homework and studies and other after-school activities, and it is also beneficial to the entire household if there is someone based in the house who is ready to provide food to members of the household who come home and are very hungry and tired.\u00a0 However, there is also an unwritten hierarchy in a one-career family, and that is\u2014the working parent is known as the breadwinner or the head of the household, and the other parent who stays at home is not considered to be of authority because he/she is not earning any money."
"Make it a habit to always try and find ways to improve your current situation. Optimists are often proactive because they know how to see the good in the bad. No matter how bad things may get, if you make this habit a part of your life, you will become an optimist before you know it!"
"Erikson\u2019s stages are all said through virtues. To help explain what each virtue is, Erikson talks about each stage of the crisis, relationships, and malignancies. In my case, we will talk about Initiative vs. Guilt. This would be known as the preschool stage, but in my situation I will be talking more about my interaction with other children and parents rather than the age portion. The relationship I will be discussing is between myself \u201cadopted child\u201d and my parents."
"When the children go into key stage 2 they have already started to mature especially the way they communicate with each other and their teachers, they will have a level of understanding and will be more considerate of the needs of others especially with children with \u2018special needs\u2019 they tend to protect them alot more and interact with them and help to keep them on the right path. You will at some point still have to remind them not to interrupt when others are talking but this could be due to immaturity."
"I cried of joy, no one had ever done something like that for me. It was an awesome way to celebrate my birthday. The relationship has been going very well, and I\u2019m positive that it will continue to stay like that. It just comes to show that that myth about how dating your best friend is bad isn\u2019t always true. It can happen to anyone, and yes it doesn\u2019t work out for some people, but in my case it worked out for the better. As I said before, I don\u2019t think we were meant to be best friends, just something more."
"A study done by Professor Mathhew Desmond concluded how communities, especially the black community, lost its trust in the police department after an incident with unarmed man Frank Jude. Frank Jude was at a police officers housewarming party, when off-duty officers blamed Frank and his friend of stealing one of the officer\u2019s badge. The off-duty officers made racist remarks and the proceeded to beat Frank. Because of this incident that included police brutality, the community decreased the amount of crimes they reported to 911 stating, \u201cThe magnitude of the crime-call decline in Milwaukee was large and long lasting. It persisted for over a year, \u201cresult[ing] in a loss of approximately 22,200 911 calls, a 17 percent reduction in citizen crime reporting, compared with the expected number of calls.\u201d19 Moreover, the \u201cmissing\u201d calls were primarily confined to the areas of Milwaukee in which mostly African Americans lived\u201d (pg.1358). The police community tends to forget is that key events in our history that impacted society the most, is the main cause for the problems that have emerged today. Since Michael Browns death in 2014, Black lives matter movement arise. There are controversies of what happened that day when Michael Brown was shot and killed that have raised questions whether to believe eyewitnesses, the officer or the police dash cam. Therefore, police agencies have adapted a new piece of technology that is able to record from a first-hand experience, from beginning to end. Vehicle dash cameras have been an effective tool police agencies have used for many years. Vehicle cameras were mainly used to capture the sound and scenery of what only is ahead of the vehicle, lacking the ability to record everything else. Because of this, police agencies lacked the ability to use their vehicle dash cameras to support their statements."
"Depressive disorders during childhood and adolescence may be more virulent and of longer duration than depressive disorders in adults. Depressive disorders during childhood are a risk factor for the development of additional psychological disturbances and for the development of depressive disorders later in life. The number of youths who are experiencing depressive disorders is increasing at the same time that the age of onset is decreasing (Mash & Barkley, 2006 p.336)."
"Booker T. Washington noted how Twain\u201dsucceeded in making his\u00a0readers feel a genuine respect for\u2019Jim,'\u201dand pointed out that Twain,in creating Jim\u2019s character,had\u201dexhibited his sympathy and interest in the masses of the negro people. \u201d The great black novelist Ralph Ellison,too,noted how Twain allows Jim\u2019s\u201ddignity and human capacity\u201dto emerge in the novel. \u201cHuckleberry Finn knew,as did Mark Twain[Ellison wrote],that Jim was not only a slave but a human being[and]a symbol of humanity\u2026 and in freeing Jim,Huck makes a bid to free himself of the conventionalized evil taken for civilization by the town\u201d\u2013in other words,of the abomination of slavery itself."
"After 1979, in the Thatcherite era it was much the opposite, New Right thinkers wanted less state intervention. They argued that the individual is responsible for their own successes or failures. \u2018 The use of the Welfare State to promote welfarism now began to be seen as costly, unnecessary and morally repugnant political instrument which financially cripples the successful in order to feather-bed the lives of the disadvantaged members of society\u2019. (Bilton, 1997, P497) When the Labour Party came into power in 1997 a new perspective was introduced called New Individualism."
"Are cops abusing their power? Police fatally shot 987 people last year or two dozen more than they killed in 2016, according to an ongoing Washington Post database project that tracks the fatal shootings. Cops have been judging unarmed and innocent citizens way too quickly and those numbers seem to be increasing with frequency unless someone speaks up."
"Secondly, people share very private information on social networking sites, as Nico Reiher(2009) mentions, \u201c If the receiver of the information is not trustworthy, the user does not have a chance to track or remove this information back into trustworthy hands.\u201d causes some serious troubles. Firstly, people tend to announce where they are at that moment and what they are doing, therefore, they share real-time location based information on social networking sites. To illustrate, people who share their locations and especially notify others that they are not at home on social networking sites such as Foursquare, provide an opportunity to thieves to rob their houses. In addition, Facebook which is the most popular and preferred social networking sites, also enables people to share that much private information with the \u201ccheck-in\u201d application."
"Cooper is likely to convey that any white, even the noblest and most sensitive man will be proud to be white in front of whatever race whether it\u2019s white\u2019s opponent. Another evident that supports Hawkeye racism is when he perceived Magua initially as a bad man without meeting the Indian yet. He based his judgment based on prejudice not on experience. \u201cA Mingo is a Mingo, and God having made him so, neither the Mohawks nor any other tribe can alter him\u201d (Cooper, 1804). Hawkeye like any other white men perceives Indians as horrible creatures basing on race."
"As soon as Abraham Lincoln became president, South Carolina seceded. This showed that the state didn\u2019t feel part of the Union because it believed that the president was going to want to abolish slavery and South Carolina was reliant on slavery. So, because they seceded more states after them, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina and Tennessee. Already before the war it was clear that the United States were dividing into the North and South. Historian Arthur Cole wrote, \u201d Lincoln was pictured in many quarters not only as a black Republican but as an Abolitionist, a fanatic of the John Brown type.\u201d Fundamentally, this means that the South saw Lincoln as a \u201cblack Republican\u201d who is definitely going to break up the Union, and so this is what it led to, the secession of 11 states. The southerners believed that Lincoln was an Abolitionist because of the John Brown raid, who was from the North. He was against slavery, and was extremely violent compared to the other Abolitionists. Him and 18 other men attempted to raid the government armoury at Harper\u2019s Ferry. He was captured and hung. This just shows the hatred that there was towards the northerners, and that because of this, it helped build up the tension between the North and South and then lead to the secession of the southern states. As the historian Walter Edgar says, that when Lincoln did come to power, it was a shock for the southerners, and that they because of this the nation began dividing and causing war."
"Sylvia Plath\u2019s poem \u2018Daddy\u2019 expresses the struggle for female identity by basing it around the Holocaust, one of the most gruesome, immoral events in the whole of history. Plath uses this event as a metaphor for her struggles in life, and the struggles of women in general for independence. The male figure used in this poem is in the shape of Hitler, a man of unfathomable evil. In this poem, \u2018Daddy\u2019 is seen as a Hitler figure during the metaphor of the Holocaust."
"If a woman is at a risk of dying or becoming severely handicapped, due to the pregnancy, she should have the choice especially if she has other children to look after. Abortion is not murder, as it only destroys a collection of cells, which cannot survive out side the mother\u2019s womb."
"One must then tread into the next relevant level, moving woman to mother. Is a mother born or made? In this thesis author would argue that a mother, although influenced by essential facets of her separate self, is made. Social constructionism, then, is at the center of this thesis due to the African-American mothers addressed within their specific environments in this novel."
"In the poem, Duffy mocks men, ridiculing them for showing weakness.\u00a0In particular, lines 43-46, describing the man, very distressed at starting his period, ridicule men for not being able to cope with such trivial things that women have to cope with all the time.\u00a0At the end of the poem the narrator spites the man by introducing him to her lover, a female.\u00a0This is Duffy being derisive towards men, gaining the last laugh, for when the man leaves the narrator to become a woman; she gets him back in the most ironic and spiteful way possible."
"Spivak says, reveal their \u201cpolitical interests\u201d in those claims. As intellectuals. both are at home (although their belonging is qualified by Freud\u2019s being Jewish and Spivak\u2019s being a nonwhite women) within the dominant discourse. The subaltern is not similarly privileged. And does not speak in a vocabulary that will get a hearing in institutional locations of power. The subaltern enters official and intellectual discourse only rarely and usually through the mediating commentary of someone more at home in those discourses. If the problematic is understood this way, it is hard to see how the subaltern can be capable of speaking. In the third part of the essay, Spivak offers yet a further twist."
"In a competition of An Inconvenient Truth\u2019 vs The Great Global Warming Swindle\u2019, both the films provide a very strong opposition to each other. Each documentary took a definite stance on global warming, whether it is human-caused and on whether climate change presents an imminent danger to human kind. While both documentaries received accolades, both documentaries were also criticized for containing flawed data by those for and against anthropogenic global warming theories. \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth\u201d claims that there is a scientific consensus that global warming is anthropogenic (originating in human activity). However, \u201cThe Great Global Warming Swindle\u201d disproves that claim stating, \u201cThe most highly qualified and respected scientists can be blind to obvious deficiencies in a theory and will be dismissive of evidence when it undermines what they want to believe.\u201d"
"Mr. Baldwin should act with HRM to create a hiring policy that allows for a greater diverse workforce. HRM needs to invest in different recruiting methods to attract diverse candidates other than the majority of Latinos or Vietnamese. Reaching out to local colleges, local churches, county and city offices, posting job openings on job boards, etc. will allow the word of job openings to spread to different diverse groups. \u201cPlan to post job opportunities on a wide variety of online employment websites, such as Times Change Women Employment Service,\u00a0Diversity Link, LGBT Job World and Simply Hired as well as newspapers and magazines that target different ages, minority groups and alternative lifestyle communities. Arrange to attend a variety of job fairs and recruitment events, including those which highlight the achievements and credentials of visible minorities, women and alternative lifestyle groups\u201d (Wolski, n.d.)."
"Over the last few years, there has been an alarming increase in the levels of teen crimes. Teens involved in crimes has been an issue and the problem is still upholding. The real question is why are teens engaging in crimes? Furthermore, what is really the problem? Studies show that teenagers have been engaging in crimes due to lack of family involvement, financial hardship , and substance abuse and peer pressure."
"At the same time, they were being challenged to adjust to their roles within their won community as many of the racism they faced against their indigenous heritage in Guatemala persisted. The irony is that they heritage that they are being persecuted form is also the source of the philosophical perspective that give them the will to survive and bear the conditions and challenges of their journey north. The siblings peg all of their social interactions from their observations as well as each other\u2019s perspectives."
"The statistics both sources quote contradict each other. It seems very unlikely that 88% of people believe it to be \u2018sometimes necessary to smack a child\u2019 and also 71% believe in equal protection. This would mean at 59% of people believe both. The surveys cannot both be representative of the UK population, or perhaps are outdated."
"Race plays a vital role in deciding who is sentenced to die: The two major factors that decides who lives and who dies are the race of victim and the race of defendant. It was concluded from the report of General Accounting Office in the year 1990 that those people who killed the whites were mostly sentenced to death than those who killed blacks."
"An exceeding amount of Chinese immigrants were willing to work long hours for less pay, leading to many Native-born Americans to resent the Chinese and believe they were pilfering them of job opportunities. Animosity grew due to American nativists desiring a scapegoat to blame for their economic misfortune. Hate crimes against the Chinese became prominent; racist graffiti adorned various areas, anti-Chinese riots occurred, and many people even went to such lengths as to suggest the barring and deportation of all Chinese-Americans. This dissatisfaction ultimately lead to the racism-fueled Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which was the first time that race had been used to exclude an entire group of people from entering the United States."
"Even if the games are not violent, another side effect that video games have on the health of children is with exercising. In a pediatrics journal, it states that 9 million kids are overweight, which is three times the amount it was in 1980. I am not stating that video games are the sole proprietor of this drastic increase, but for children, playing a video game usually takes precedent over exercising. With this increase in body mass, children have become more susceptible in acquiring what are usually known as adult diseases such as diabetes."
"This may explain why the article shows such cliche images of Aboriginal children, and families with no information regarding the story itself. This can be a reference to how the media and in this case \u201cThe Australian,\u201d portray Indigenous people to the Australian public via their print and visual media. The stereotypical undertone is clearly prevalent. To develop a proper understanding of the stereotyping issue within the Australian media, one has to incorporate the first hand views of the Indigenous people. How do they view their representation? Waller (2010, p. 19) refers to a telephone meeting involving Walpiri elders from Yuendumu."
"It is widely argued too that Westerners use the concept of the White Man\u2019s Burden as a camouflage for their exploitation of the non-white people and their lands. One of the significant reasons for the hostile policy of the imperial expansion is economic exploitation. By acquiring new territories, the colonial nation testifies an economic growth. It takes benefits from their resources; makes use of their raw materials with receiving their cheap labor, brings the raw materials to their homeland to be turned into manufactured goods and then gets it back to the colonized lands to be sold in their markets with larger profits."
"This negative perception of black pupils and association with gang culture, was highlighted in the LDA report (2004) where one Black Caribbean (B/C) pupil commented that, \u2018when it is white boys it is a group, but when it is black boys, it is a gang\u2019 showing how the relationship between B/C students and white teachers is one based on \u2018conflict and fear\u2019. The labelling of students inevitably leads to different student responses, with those that conform most likely to be I and C students who are viewed as the \u2018ideal pupils\u2019 whilst Sewell and Hall have recognised how black students can create a \u2018culture of resistance\u2019 to school and rebel or retreat completely from the"
"After the phone conversation, Hally insults Sam\u2019s dream of a world without collisions and becomes incredibly nasty to Sam. He has changed again, and all because of the news of his father\u2019s return. This conflict is the greatest in the play, much larger than the two that preceded it. Hally expresses his disinterest in his father, until Sam defends him, and Hally loses control of his emotions. At this point, both Sam and Hally are \u201cdancing\u201d too fast to stop from colliding with each other. While previous collisions could be avoided, both Sam and Hally take it to the extreme."
"First is the limited recognition and understanding of domestic violence in the case of homosexual couples. This is perhaps due to the complex issue of accepting homosexual partnership more so with homosexual domestic violence. Lack of understanding or unacceptability of homosexual partnership would likely yield to negative reactions from society and evasion in addressing homosexual domestic violence. Aversion and evasion are the expected reactions of society to issues that it cannot understand. (Peterman & Dixon, 2003; Brown, 2008)"
"First, gender assignment should be made promptly after birth, as hesitation could result in the stigmatization of the infant. Second, the assignment should parallel the prognosis for future sexual function and fertility as closely as possible. Third, Money emphasized that an infant\u2019s gender is highly \u201cmalleable\u201d during the first eighteen months of its life. Because no gender identity has begun, he proposed that proper treatment (hormones) could effectively construct the gender of choice."
"In addition, parents must be sure to practice talking with their children about their feelings. Children who have good social skills can put feelings into words. Parents can help a child to do this by giving him chances for speaking up his emotions. For example, parents should try to listen and sympathize, rather than minimizing their feelings."
"Implicit acts of racism can be noted through two significant events and incidents \u2013 one being the event at Poisson D\u2019Or and the other being the job interview for Braithwaite, as an engineer. In the restaurant incident, the mistreatment of Braithwaite, by the waiter dropping soup, and not on Gillian (who was white-skinned) and the appearance of a smirk, across the waiter\u2019s mouth, shows the disrespect and intentionality of the act."
"What legal barriers exist to help or stand in the way of the process? Religious organizations are the ones that probably have the best chance of reaching out to the immigrant and ethnic populations. The main problem lies in the political structure and the tails of immigrants trying to navigate the maze of the nation\u2019s immigration laws. \u201cIn the pews of the First Baptist Church of Orlando, where thousands of evangelical Christians gather on Sundays to worship and sing, a change of heart is happening on the once toxic issue of immigration. Two years ago, national evangelical leaders began to speak out in favor of legislation to give legal status to immigrants in the United States illegally. Now, as Congress is about to start a debate on overhauling the immigration system, conservative Christians, once inclined to take a hard line on immigrants they viewed as lawbreakers, are consulting their Bibles and coming around to the pastors\u2019 view."
"The riot occurred because of a death of an African American child. This riot was the biggest riot in Illinois history. So in conclusion, racial tension and inequality between African Americans and whites are the two main reasons why these riots occurred. (Encyclopedia of Chicago) The Division Street riot was a turning point on history because they showed how racial the government was, how violent and dangerous riots can be and how they riot can affect the atmosphere. First, in the Chicago riot there were cases were police would only arrest African Americans for having possessions of weapons and not whites."
"No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o\u2019clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge.\u201d (Dickens 14). Next there is Tiny Tim, he seems to be a symbol of hope in this story even though he has to use a crutch to walk and he is very small. Despite his disability, he constantly keeps the spirit up and tries to maintain it in all his brothers, sisters, and parents, even though they are poor. He is the epitome of the Christmas spirit, that which should inhibit all of us. \u201d He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember, upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk and blind men see.\u201d (125). This quote just shows how thoughtful he is, and how much he cares for others. Tiny Tim\u2019s father Bob Cratchit is next on my list. He is an employee of Scrooge and he is the only one in the Cratchit family to thank him genuinely for the job and the pay that he has given him to support his family and keep food in their stomachs. \u201c\u2026and in came little Bob, the father, with at least three feet of comforter, exclusive on the fringe, hanging down before him, and his threadbare clothes all darned up to look seasonable, and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder.\u201d(121). The father\u2019s love for his family bleed through the fact that they are poor and Scrooge sees this in the way they act. The last but not least major character is Scrooge\u2019s nephew, Fred. He seems to be the only individual who comes to converse with Scrooge and offer him anything. In this case, Fred offered him an invitation to his house for Christmas dinner. Fred is convinced at the beginning of the story that Scrooge doesn\u2019t really mean \u201cBah!\u2026Humbug!\u201d (18) no matter how many times he says it. Fred is presented cheerful and in high spirits. \u201cHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge\u2019s, that he was all in a glow; his face ruddy and handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\u201d (18). As I said before, Fred is one of the few that feels pity for Scrooge. 3.) The book starts off talking about Jacob Marley, Scrooge\u2019s former business partner. It basically says that he \u201cwas dead as a door-nail\u201d (11). Then it moves to Scrooges counting house where he converses with Fred. Then two men come in to ask for a donation and Scrooge shoos them away quickly enough. Then Bob Cratchit come in for a days work and Scrooge is stingy about putting coal on the fire. At this point in the book, Scrooge is not made out to be a nice, caring, giving man. When Scrooge goes home, he is confronted by the ghost of Marley who tells him that he will be haunted by three spirits over the course of the next three days, each at One O\u2019clock. The first spirit that comes is the Ghost of Christmas Past. This spirit takes Scrooge back to his childhood where he sees a very lonely boy engulfed in his books without a friend. Then they skip ahead in time and see when Scrooge was an apprentice to Mr. Fizziwig. This episode shows the Christmas party that Old Fizziwig threw and here is where he met the love of his life. Once again the ghost skips ahead to a time when Scrooge and the woman are speaking. She says that she has been replaced by a golden idol and there is not any room for her anymore. After this, the first Ghost leaves. The next ghost, the Ghost of Christmas Present as come to show him how his hostility toward others affect the way people live. The majority of the trip takes place at the Cratchits home. Here, Scrooge sees Tiny Tim\u2019s hope and the togetherness of the family. I personally think this scene is one of the most important in convincing Scrooge to change. Then Scrooge is transported to his nephew Fred\u2019s house where he is having his Christmas party. He then sees that even his nephew mocks him. Then the ghost takes him to what would be considered the bad part of town, under a bridge. There he sees a truly poor family, this one without a home. Even here the family stays together and refuses to be broken up, despite their disposition. The Ghost of Christmas Present leaves and then he encounters the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. This ghost is very mysterious, never talking. It merely points with it\u2019s long, narrow fingers. The scene again is the Cratchits, this time sorrow instead of joy. Tiny Tim has died and the family mourns his pasing. Bob just returned from the cemetery and comments about how beautiful it is. Next the ghost shows how the people of the town react to a man\u2019s death. No one seems to care about the loss of this wretched human being. Even some people steal his belongings out from under his dead body in his own bed. Scrooge does not realize they are all talking about him until the ghost takes him to the cemetery when Scrooge sees his own gravestone. From this point on Scrooge begs the ghost to let him change his lifestyle and try to change it for the better. When Scrooge wakes up he realizes that it is Christmas Day. He starts his new life of good will by buying a prize goose for the Cratchits. Then he makes a donation to the men that he shooed away the day before and he joins his nephew Fred for his Christmas dinner and Tiny Tim lives! 4). The first ghost, The Ghost of Christmas Past- This apparition comes to Scrooge to show him where his pain is coming from and when he turned his life toward the direction of money. The spirit was \u201c\u2026like a child; yet not so like a child as like an old man , viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a child\u2019s proportion. It\u2019s hair\u2026was white, as if with age; and yet the face had not wrinkled\u2026It wore a tunic of purest white; and round it\u2019s waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful.\u201d (63). The second ghost, The Ghost of Christmas Present- This ghost shows how Scrooge\u2019s lifestyle has affected the people who he has contact with. Every man and woman that knows him or knows of him have a set idea of him. A mean, old, stickler. The spirit was \u201c\u2026clothed in one simple, deep-green robe, or mantle, bordered with white fur.\u201d(107). He had a holly wreath, a scabbard without a sword, and dark-brown curls. The third ghost, The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come- This third ghost was very mysterious, Scrooge made most of the conclusions during this time himself, although very self-explanatory. I personally think that this apparition carried the most weight in changing Scrooge. It made him greatly sorry for his sinful behavior of his past and vowed to change his life. Not much was said about the spirit except that it was dressed darkly and did not speak, only pointed. 5). The message that Dickens is trying to get across is one of happiness. If you live your life in seclusion, only speaking to those who you must and always being nasty, you can never be truly happy. Dickens uses Scrooge as the epitome of selfishness and we are suppose to realize this and contrast it with Tiny Tim\u2019s attitude of caring and sharing. He is the epitome of joy and hope. He is the person in the book with who we are suppose to learn from. The ghost are the conduit from which we are to understand the past, present, and future of an unhappy man. 6.) Life in the 1800\u2019s was one of simplicity, everyone seemed to know each other in their area. People lived and worked in their neighborhood, which brought a greater sense of community and family values. Some Christmas customs were hanging candles from a tree instead of ornaments. Holidays always seemed to be a gathering of people to celebrate the occasion. The dress in the time period seemed to be top hats, slacks, vest, and a coat. From the movie that we watched, the style seemed very formal. When speaking to another person, it was speaking in proper English, never a \u2018Yo\u2019 or a \u2018Whaz up\u2019. This is because of the time period and the slang we use now had developed with our generation. Although very different, it is very ,much alike. A Christmas Carol was a very good book and a lesson to be learned by all, and in the words of Tiny Tim, \u201cGod Bless Us, every one\u201d (130) !"
"By comparing her new place of residence to a hole, Saroj feels trapped or exiled within this alien land, proving to be the motive for her resentment. Saroj displays her regret when she wishes to have stayed in India by saying that she would have been happier there thus providing a reason for her refusal to find happiness in her new environment. Similarly in Monica Ali\u2019s novel Brick Lane, Chanu Ahmed was asked for permission by his wife, Nazeen, to attend English lessons and here he demonstrate the characteristic of resentment: Your going to be a mother\u2026Will that not keep you busy enough?\u00a0And you can\u2019t take a baby to college. Babies have to be fed; they have to have their bottoms cleaned. It\u2019s not so simple as that. Just to go to college, like that."
"In closing, I feel like many different things affect a person\u2019s parenting style. These things can stem from how that particular person was raised. The timeframe they were raised in and the culture that they come from. I can honestly say that I think my style of parenting is that of the authoritative style. As I mentioned above in how I raise my own son. I am more democratic with him and try to help guide him with some pretty standard expectations. My upbringing has a lot to do with how I chose to raise my son. That and my experiences thus far in life. I have to deal with people all the time in my job and have learned certain way to deal or handle a lot of different situations. I try and teach him these things much earlier in life then I did or save him from learning the hard way in a sense."
"Mr. and Mrs. X attribute the success of their marriage to their strong faith and hope in God who blesses their marriage and to the love that they have for one another. They go to church together for almost 20 years now and their zealous life improved their relationship as husband and wife. The bible states that the husband should be served, loved and cared by his wife while the wife should be protected, supported and loved by the husband. Mr. and Mrs. X follow this passionately and arguments or problems with their relationship are lessened. If there was an argument or a fight between the couple, they tend to rationalize things and think maturely. They try their best to talk with one another and control their temper."
"Fitzgerald wishes to convince the reader that Tom is a highly despicable character, but he does not come out and say such in so many words. Rather, he meticulously describes Tom\u2019s actions so that the reader is left to draw no other conclusion. His views are clearly racist, evidenced by his choice of reading: \u201cHave you read the Rise of the Coloured Empires by Goddard?\u201d This refers to a genuine book that was around at that time, titled The Rising Tide Of Colour by Lothrop Stoddard, which increases the realism. Tom feels threatened by the rising power of racial minorities and wishes to preserve the archaic status quo. Fitzgerald\u2019s skilful use of naturalistic realism would suggest that The Great Gatsby is more effective as a realist novel rather than a symbolic novel."
"\u2018 The fact of Derek\u2019s mental age also created disputes as it was clear he was mentally subnormal and ill prepared to undergo cross-examination at that period in time. From my knowledge of the case I think that Derek Bentley suffered a terrible miscarriage of justice. He was below the mental age of criminal responsibility and shouldn\u2019t have even been on trial. Derek hadn\u2019t once been in contact with the murder weapon and was already arrested when Chris opened fire. The evidence alone is enough to liberate Derek from his charges but an error of judgement caused his freedom to be withheld."
"Facebook users are starting to get more and more addicted each day. According to an article from WebMD, in a 2009 survey of 1,030 parents, Rosen and colleagues found out that children and teens had spent more time engaged in media (online and offline) had more anxiety, more stomachaches, and more sick days from school. In teens, the time spent playing video games also led to poorer health. In another ongoing survey of teens and adults, Rosen found that spending more time than average on Facebook was associated with signs of narcissism, anxiety, and bipolar disorder on a standard psychological test. In another 2011 study, 279 middle school, high school, and university students lost focus for an average of three minutes for every fifteen minutes spent studying or doing another task. Checking Facebook just once during the fifteen minute period was associated with lower grades. Not only does Facebook cause lower grades, it also can ruin someones self-esteem."
"After reading the biographies of the promoted, one commonality between these employees became evident; most of these individuals have MBA degrees. In my career to date, positioning myself towards a path that gives me the greatest opportunity to progress my career has been essential. Having an internship every summer at companies such as GE Capital and Burger King during my undergrad years and completing the management development rotational program at AC Nielsen are examples of the path that I have established for myself to build and grow as an employee."
"Police misconduct can be broken down into 3 categories. Civil, procedural, and criminal. Which means a violation in department policies, a violation in constitutional protections or a violation of the law itself. Not to say that two can\u2019t be broken in one action or even all three at once. Many departments have what is called a \u201cuse of force continuum\u201d which establishes the rules on what type of force is permissible in response to specific actions that a suspect may perform."
"Away, The Island and the UNICEF website all convey many aspects of change. These aspects are similar in some sense, however are also very different. Within \u201caway\u201d the main ideas of change were quite similar and correlated to the other texts as they similarly involved superficial barriers that prevented or delayed change from happening. In the case of \u201caway\u201d these superficial barriers were the material positions that Gwen held close to her, not allowing her to appreciate the family and the life that she had."
"The Bureau of Labor Statistics (2019) claims that the average growth of occupations is around 7%. The demand for accountants and auditors will increase 3% more than this at 10%. Globalization and more complex tax laws will increase the need for these positions and that those with their CPA license will have an advantage for more desired positions."
"This also shapes others identity too, more people rather wear something that is well known then wear their traditional/ cultural clothing. They don\u2019t want to be discriminated against, plus it makes it easier to fit in with other cultures if you have something in common i. e. clothing. Our individual and collective identities are affected by communication and the media in many ways. One of those ways being, how we easily can talk to people on the other side of the world within minutes even seconds, between sixty and eighty years ago, we wouldn\u2019t be able to talk to people on the other side of the world."
"I will be expressing my view on an issue that has divided the United-states of America, an issue that is as stark as pro-life verses pro-choice\u2026\u2026 arising as a result of making illegal all forms of abortion in the state of Alabama unless the mothers life is deemed as seriously at risk."
"Drawing a conclusion on this issue is difficult, though the degrading condition of Australia\u2019s biggest tourist attraction, the expected extinction of massive races of fauna and flora, and the constant rise in temperature suggest that precautions have to be taken when dealing with this issue and the future of the next generations. Do we really want to be known as the generation who doomed their children by leaving behind an endoskeleton of what the world once was? Well, let me ask you this; why would the dumbest species on that perfect planet become dumb enough to continue to use the resources that destroy it?"
"Some numbers that reflect the increase are South Koreans goods exported to China increased from IIS$I . Ban to US$49. Ban and China\u2019s goods exported to South Korea increased from IIS$mom to $US. Ban. South Koreans investment in China ,by the end of 2004, totaled US$8. Banned-Gung,2006). The Pharmaceutical industry also has contributed to the impact on South Koreans growth. Three countries are tied to this industry and include Taiwan, China and South Korea. As a result of this advancing market, South Korea, China and Taiwan have developed their own pharmaceutical industries. South Korea has changed their state policy to promote and help South Korea 12 small science organizations. They all created aggressive policies."
"The economic takeover of one nation by a more powerful one and the subsequent political and social domination of the native population is called colonialism. If the takeover of one nation is trough the military superiority of the more powerful one for the purpose of territorial expansion and establishing colonies, it is termed as military colonialism. On the other hand, if the economic takeover is made through the great technological superiority of the more powerful one, the institutionalization of their businesses in their former colonies, the control and domination of most of a colony\u2019s natural resources, the imposition of trade policies and economic treaties favorable to their side; the establishment of outlets for their surplus capital; the need for more cheap labor, raw materials, and markets to fuel their growing economy, the process is termed neo-colonialism or economic imperialism."
"Religion helps provide justice. As I have already shown, religion is a powerful motivation and inspiration to people, overriding external authorities when it seems just. The reason for this is that religion answers first to god, then society and god principley aims to achieve justice. Racial segregation and racism is unjust and therefore god seeks to fight against it through religion, and not promote it."
"Hence, this diary. In order to enhance in my mind\u2019s eye the picture of the friend for whom I have waited so long, I don\u2019t want to set down a series of bald facts in a diary like most people do, but I want this diary itself to be my friend, and I shall call my friend Kitty. No one will grasp what I\u2019m talking about if I begin my letters to Kitty just out of the blue, so, albeit unwillingly, I will start by sketching in brief the story of my life."
"In \u201cAnimating Youth: The Disneyfication of Children\u2019s Culture,\u201d Henry Giroux discusses whether Disney\u2019s animated films are a good influence on kids. He argues that they teach ideas in their films that are contradictory to societal priorities. Giroux states that in Disney, females \u201care ultimately subordinate to males and define their sense of power and desire almost exclusively in terms of dominant male narratives\u201d (71). Although Disney movies are beautiful to watch, they are portraying harmful stereotypes. Disney has shown these stereotypes in many of their famous films."
"Hence care and share between husband and wife is the basics of family harmony. OPENNESS: The husband and wife will lead a meaningful life only by openness. Once we hide anything, the hidden will block the meaningful relation. Need not be open for any thing and everything, but to be open at maximum possible, Gandhiji became \u201cMahatma\u201d through the openness. Openness creates confidence and it is the foundation for healthy relation. Hence openness is a required character of family harmony. Sacrifice: For a healthy, ever lasting and enjoyable relationship, sacrifice the insulated Ego, smaller individual interests own leisure\u2019s and pleasures ."
"Few scholars like Mooij and Smeets in Holland were of the view that possessing ICT skills does not warrant use of computers in teaching.\u00a0By analyzing and synthesizing the different ways of classifying and categorizing ICT usage in the classrooms,\u00a0the literature informs a repertoire of using ICT in teaching and learning.\u00a0Children who exposed to school ICT programmes learned better than children not exposed.\u00a0Whenever teachers used follow up activities,\u00a0student\u2019s attitudes toward ICT 52 programmes were found are higher."
"The fact that he talks to himself suggests an element of mental instability, which is backed up elsewhere in the novel where, \u201cfrom out of Lennie\u2019s head there came a little fat old woman.\u201d He hallucinates, a classic symptom of mental illness. We could not possibly blame him for what happened when he is clearly not fully in control of his own mind. Lennie needed help, not chastisement. Even when Curley is assaulting him in section three he, \u201cretreats,\u201d rather than fighting back. Steinbeck presents him as someone who hates violence. The only reason he attacked Curley was fear, and because George told him to do it."
"Science is our friend in the field of Medicine and in the aspect of health. When we are sick, it has the solution for us. It can detect what our illness is and what kind of cure will be applied to it. Because of the experiments and tests the scientists are making, we are able to extend our lives and our loved ones lives. The herbal medicines were to improve for an easier way for us to chew, drink, or apply it directly. This can lessen our time in boiling, squeezing or preparing such herbal leaves."
"This is notably the first hint at madness in the play, and Hamlet, perhaps having doubts about what the ghost says, delays his revenge and sets out to find proof for himself. He wants proof to assure himself that the ghost\u2019s words are valid, and thus he puts on a \u2018play within a play\u2019 on the theme of his father\u2019s death called the Murder of Gonzago to watch the reaction of his uncle. Whilst he delays his revenge, Hamlet does pretend to be mad, fulfilling Horatio\u2019s prediction in a manner. The result of all of this is that Ophelia, his lover, actually turns mad and commits suicide."
"Society is affected as a whole when children are not vaccinated. Due to the significant increase in infectious disease rates in California, the legislature intervened to stop parents from citing personal or religious beliefs to avoid vaccinating their children (Law to prevent). Particularly, California state officials removed the ability of parents to cite personal belief as a reason for exempting their children from vaccine requirements (Texas minimum). However, the trend toward mandatory vaccinations of children is not consistent throughout the United States. For example, in Rockland County, New York, a judge lifted a ban on unvaccinated children. The ban prohibited unvaccinated children from going out in public places for 30 days (Judge lifts ban). Not everyone agreed, however, with the judge\u2019s decision to lift the ban. Rockland County executive Ed Day said, he feared for the well-being of pregnant women and children because they would be put at risk and could suffer life-threatening complications (Judge lifts ban).\u201d"
"The sense of excitement throughout gives a clear impression that the female character satisfies the wolf by using her adolescence as an admirable trait, to pursue her passions referring to herself as a \u2018little girl who is to \u2018dearly love a wolf\u2019 in order to \u2018read his verse\u2019. Duffy gives a clear insight on her longing to gain the secrets of adulthood and nature from the wolf, who eventually becomes old and boring. This is best exemplified by the reputation of \u2018same\u2019 in the sixth stanza in which she subsequently emasculates him cutting him from \u2018scrotum to throat\u2019, leaving the female character to be wholly empowered and thus sings \u2018all alone\u2019 by the last line. This wholly emphasises the subsequent idea that women can overpower men to achieve self-validation in the world and become a symbol of empowerment by using their own desirable traits to override masculinity. The significance of \u2018Little Red Cap\u2019 may lie as a similarity to Duffy\u2019s own relationship with Adrian Henri, which draws on a similar experience following Little Red Cap\u2019s and may influence her apparent adolescence. Duffy being 16 while entering a relationship with Henri, 39 draws a parallel as she described Henri as \u2018giving her confidence\u2019 and the relationship was \u2018all poetry and sex\u2019, which was \u2018very heady. This poem reflects youth in an autobiographical sense and in fact reinforces a sense of fulfillment and pride, of which Duffy creates the impression that little red cap leaves fully advantaged and she departs when she feels satisfied and fully confident in comparison to the start when there was a sense of need and desire to be \u2018in his wake\u2019. However, a feminist critic may be more inclined to hold this view as there is a prospect of sexual and personal liberation, a free expression that women should be able to not only explore but should also freely express any sexual and promiscuous desires if this is what they should aspire. An alternate feminist critic may however oppose this view of self-objectification and believe instead that women are of equal beings to men who hold a sexual nature and can express these feelings without it being a mechanism in attempt to exploit masculinity."
"\u201cHills like White Elephants\u201d by Ernest Hemingway documents a story between two people, a man, and a woman waiting to board a train in Spain. The story takes the form of a dialogue between the man and woman about a contentious issue. Throughout the book, Ernest displays the difference in opinion between women and men about abortion and pregnancy. Furthermore, the author captures the emotions of the characters using metaphors. When the conversation begins in the story, the author does not reveal to the audience what the story is about, but as the dialogue progresses, it is clear that the two characters are talking about abortion."
"From the previous example, this leads us to the rise in deportation under the title of \u2018removal of criminal aliens\u201d which parallels that of the deportation which is currently ongoing by President Trump\u2019s orders. The detainees taken by ICE, have been removed from their homes under the tense of criminal removability grounds. This brought in an explosion of detainees being held against their will and their removal from the United States."
"Many teenagers try to bring out their dreams to be exactly like their favorite hero done in the game or movie. By selling and showing these games and movies, I would emphasize that we are propagation a production of violent children, which make our society more violent in the future. We have to teach our children that violence is bad for our society. We try to teach our children self respect brotherhood and patience. We also teach our children don\u2019t hurt anybody and always help others."
"Friendship is the one cement that will ever hold the world together,\u2019 (Woodrow T. Wilson). Everybody has friends. Without friends people can survive but cannot live. Day by day a strong bond is created in this relationship and that bond unites people forever. Indeed, There are a number of things that make someone a good friend. An ideal friend could differ, but they\u2019re always trustworthy, intelligent and supportive."
"Education plays a major role in determining one\u2019s health. The people who are well-educated are more likely to experience better healthcare than the ones who are less educated. This statement is supported by Emily Zimmerman and Steven H. Woolf in their discussion paper entitled \u2018Understanding the Relationship Between Education and Health\u201d. It is mentioned in this paper on how our educational background can shape our cognitive and noncognitive skills. Simply said, we are able to weigh the good or bad of the decisions that we make for our health with a good education. Education can make us realize how important it is to care for our health. However, the point here is not to imply that a less educated person do not care about their health, but by being a more educated person, we can understand the real purpose of getting a certain treatment which eventually develops trust on our healthcare provider. Just like in Henrietta\u2019s case, she did not feel the need to go for checkups but only went to Hopkins just because she had to. The education level that she had (sixth or seventh grade) made it hard for her to comprehend the unfamiliar jargon used by the doctors and that she felt like \u201cshe is in a foreign country\u201d (Skloot, 2010). In addition, Henrietta and the people during that time, generally, do not have the knowledge in preventive measures that needed to be taken in order to take care of their health. In the book, Skloot mentioned that Henrietta thought the pain was from the sexually transmitted disease (STD) that was caused by her husband\u2019s unsafe sexual activities. It shows that David did not have the awareness of having safe sex to prevent any STDs. His lack of comprehension in this aspect had affected Henrietta\u2019s health and eventually affected their daughter, Elsie, with epilepsy. Henrietta\u2019s biography is a great example in illustrating how important it is to have good education in taking care of our health."
"They go on to explain that, in contemporary international migration, it \u201ccan be considered a new discursive line intending to hide the much-contested classical logics of assimilation or acculturation\u201d (Carrera et al, 2009: 3). Mireille Paquet defines civic integration as policies that \u201ccorrespond to mandatory measures focused on the acquisition of language and on the demonstration of individual alignment with a set of national often presented as liberal \u2013 values\u201d (Paquet, 2012: 244)."
"Respect is good way to show how nice you are, how courteous, and how good you listen. One really important place you should be respectful at is the classroom.The three main people you should be nice to are your classmates, your substitutes, and your teachers. If you want respect, then should be\u00a0respectful to everyone else. Remember, good things don\u2019t come to people who are rude."
"\u201cThe art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which no account be neglected\u201d(Sun Tzu)\u201d. The earliest known United States shooting to happen on school property was the Pontiac\u2019s Rebellion school massacre on July 26, 1764, where four Lenape American Indian entered the schoolhouse near present-day Greencastle, Pennsylvania, shot and killed school master Enoch Brown, and killed nine or ten children."
"Young people caught in negative family experiences could be adversely affected by gap in knowledge of issues related to domestic abuse (Templeton et al 2009). Young people sometimes create the circumstances they live in and in the study by Templeton 8 young people were interviewed from five families (Templeton et al 2009). It has been suggested that research in which the opinion of young people are taken directly would be needed and in this case data from five families helped understand the lives of young people who lived with parental alcohol misuse and violence. Links have been found between parental drinking and domestic abuse with verbal aggression and physical violence. The young people noted a range of strategies in which they tried to cope with their home environments and one of the ways they received support was from friends, family and other professionals. The practice and policy responses for children living in family environments will have to be changed significantly."
"Some African Americans were rejected by liberal white voters. The riots made the two races not get along even more because before the riots there were already racial tension between African Americans and whites. So in conclusion, the Division Street riot was a turning point on history because they showed how racial the government was, how violent and dangerous riots can be and how they riot can affect the atmosphere. Discrimination towards African American provoked the riot. First, when Tabitha C Wong writes \u201cangry white workers lodged a formal complaint against black migration."
"All the writer offers picture of African human beings because they are publish-colonial. But of their thoughts and thought aren\u2019t exchange that\u2019s why in joys of motherhood buchi suggests marital violence. Different writer talks about these items because the impact of colonialism is gift. The old idea in their thoughts become gift. The treatment of husband with wife is vintage and shows marital violence. The maximum popular writer of African literature ben okri additionally talk the effect of post colonialism. Ben attempt to exchange their vintage subculture by means of encourage peoples changing their antique thoughts which become present after colonialism. He alternate the idea of husband and wife to cast off marital violence but there\u2019s no change this became present."
"When we make decisions and experience things, we often describe them as being our own, \u201cours. However, when we think about why we made those decisions and why we experience things we come to realize that we are influenced by society to make decisions for us. There are many external societal factors that influence our beliefs and values which in turn affect how and why we make decisions. My family, friends, and society in general have heavily influenced the way I have lived my life and the person that I am today."
"These fossil fuels are needed for our mechanical objects we use for example, a car we use gas to make our car turn on, but this gas causes the fumes of intoxication to the air. Renewable sources wouldn\u2019t cause no danger to us, but it will be harder for us to get energy from these natural sources."
"Spivak points to the British outlawing of sati, the Hindu practice of burning a widow on her husband\u2019s funeral pyre. While this intervention saved some lives and may have given women a modicum of free choice, it also served to secure British power in India and to underscore the asserted difference between British \u201ccivilization\u201d and Indian \u201cbarbarism. \u201d Hindu culture was driven underground, written out of law, denied any legitimacy. Can today\u2019s intellectuals avoid a similar condescension when they represent the oppressed? What is Subaltern?"
"However, their study proved to have some limitations as they failed to include differences such as culture and mixed gender friendships, which could have altered their findings. Social media is becoming increasingly important in regard to friendships and the study does not help us to determine the differences between online relationships, so although the study helped to begin the psychological research in friendship, it might not benefit research in todays modern society"
"Staples main purpose of article the essay, \u201cJust Walk on By,\u201d to demonstrating the negative view of black men and the fact that racism is still alive today. He put on the path to understand the effect his appearance can have on his journey as a black man. Staples describes his extreme frustration at the fact that racism plays such a large role in his life."
"A family is the backbones of any person. Having a parent who really cares and are supportive is the best thing for any child because the parent will always ensure they give the best in terms of education to the child. Creating a strong bond between the two members will have a positive impact to the society at large. Once the child or student succeeds in their education, they will influence others and contribute to the growth of the economy. Levels competence is attributed to the level of trust and close communication with parents as well as being negatively influenced by family conflict (Campbell, Pungello, & Miller-Johnson, 2002). In a scenario where the parents are not in good terms with each other, the students get disturbed and take the stress to class which affects their level of concentration and negatively affect academic performance."
"For positive questions score allotted to each option were as \u201c4 for never, 3 for rarely, 2 for sometimes and 1 for always\u201d. For negative questions this scoring was reversed. For categorizing loneliness, 3 categories were formed. Up to 49 score was considered normal, 50 to 59 score were considered moderate loneliness, above 59 score was considered high loneliness. This grading of loneliness was based on special correspondence with the author of this questionnaire Mr. Russell through email. The original author recommended this classification system. Along with this questionnaire 8 basic demographic questions were also administered egarding name, education, age, gender, residence, parents, birth order and number of siblings. Procedure The study was carried-out in December 2011. The departments were first contacted by application to the head of department and this was followed-up by a telephone conversation to arrange a suitable date and time for the department to be visited. Prior consent was taken from participants. Before the questionnaire was administered, students were assured of the confidentiality of their responses, that there were no right or wrong answers and that they should fill in the questionnaire as truthfully as possible."
"Mass media would make me fight to prove that as a single parent I would subsume to be just another statistic. If one was to solely listen to the media than you would come to the conclusion that children raised by single a parent were more likely to end up is the same situation as the parents. They were more likely to drop out of school and not go to college. They were more likely to end up being young single parents and they were far more likely to end up using alcohol and drugs. And abuse amongst single parents on their kids was a higher risk factor as well. No. I was not going to just become a statistic."
"Capital punishment is a difficult issue to address and has been the subject of highly controversial debates over the decades. The United States Supreme Court decided in Furman v. Georgia that the death penalty was a form of cruel and unusual punishment. However, just three years later in 1975, the Supreme Court reversed their decision, and executions resumed under state regulation. The death penalty is considered the harshest from of punishment enforced today. The most common method used to implement this task is lethal injection; although, the electric chair is still used in some states."
"As these conditions progress, they also obstruct efforts to provide emotional or spiritual comfort. How can you let Grandpa know how much his life has meant to you? How do you make peace with your mother if she no longer knows who you are? Someone who has severe memory loss might not take spiritual comfort from sharing family memories or understand when others express what an important part of their life this person has been. Palliative care or hospice can be helpful in many ways to families of people with dementia."
"The 20th century has seen predominantly fundamentalist Protestant missionaries gaining converts, the \u201cCrente\u201d, as the Brazilian Protestant is known. In 1960, 90% of Brazilians gave Roman Catholicism as their religion. By the early 1990s this had dropped to just over 70% with only an estimated 10 million attending Mass regularly, although Brazil is the world\u2019s largest Roman Catholic country. Whereas only twenty-eight percent of the USA population are Roman Catholic; over eighty per cent of the population Christian and fifty-six per cent are Protestant. There are minorities of people of other religions, for example, Jewish, Amish, Mormon. The United States has produced a number of evangelists, such as Billy Graham."
"Mockery is another language device Shakespeare uses to emphasise the Capulets as traditional medieval parents. For example, Lord Capulet imitates her childish voice and says\u201d To answer, I\u2019ll not wed, I am too young, I pray pardon me\u201d to Juliet. Medieval parents neglected their children\u2019s opinions and insulted them unlike parents today who are more supportive. The quote above demonstrates the fractious nature of Lord Capulet who assumes that Juliet is too young and too childish because she is refusing the good fortune offered to her."
"A five year old girl was raped in New Delhi in 2013. Two men Manoj Shah and Pradeep Kumar were accussed of kidnapping and brutually rapping her. This incident took place after for months of Nirbhaya\u2019s case. She was found two days later, tied in the basement of East Delhi house she lived in with candles and bottles in her private parts. The child was rescued after 40 hours on April17, 2013. The trial was completed in two years and finally justice was served to Gudiya claimed as claimed by her parents."
"The main reason for this trend is that urban areas tend to make more condensation nuclei; the tiny particles are essential for water droplets to form. Despite the fact that humidity levels are lower in urban areas (due to\u00a0less vegetation and more drains/sewers), the greater concentration of condensation nuclei means that there is more cloud and rain, as well as mist and fog. Condensation nuclei is produced from car/lorry exhausts, as well as this, dust from human activity adds to the general mix. In the past, a huge amount of coal dust was produced and pumped into the atmosphere again, adding to the condensation nuclei."
"Urban life launched the era of divorce. People in the cities were having fewer children because more children would mean more mouths to feed. Women were growing more independent in the urban environment. Feminist Charlotte Perkins Gilman called upon women to abandon their dependent status and contribute to the larger life of the community through productive involvement in the economy. XVIII. In 1890, the National American Woman Suffrage Association was founded. The re-born suffrage movement and other women\u2019s organization excluded black women. Ida B. Wells helped to launch the black women\u2019s club movement, which led to the establishment of the National Association of Colored Women in 1896."
"In abusive relationships, there is a victim and a perpetrator and typically it is that of a married couple or a couple living together and there may even be children living with the couple. During these times, researchers and activists believe that the term spousal abuse is inappropriate, because the term is gender-neutral in that the abuse can be that of either a husband or wife. Some activists say that men are just as likely as women to be victims of abuse. However, in many of the hospital and police records, it shows women as the victims of domestic violence in intimate relationships. In intimidate relationships, the problem tends to be intimidation control of women by their man."
"Under the current law, gun dealers hold a Federal Firearms License and are required to conduct instant background checks before allowing a firearm to a buy, but \u201ctransfers between people who are regularly engaged in business of dealing firearms fall outside this requirement\u201d (Rivkin Jr. ). This includes family to family transfers or family to friend transfers, anyone dealing outside of a gun dealership. Though universal background checks are a great idea, it will not stop a criminal from obtaining and using it to break the law."
"Many anthropologists have argued that kinship is simply a system of meaning and symbols, they also state that animals reproduce, mate and form attachments but they do not have a kinship system. (Marx cited by Gittins p 5) argued that it distinguishes people from animals. In child birth motherhood is always known unlike fatherhood, however apart from carrying and giving birth to the child that is where the biological process stops the rest become socially constructed."
"George concurs. He raises Carlson\u2019s gun, which he has actually gotten rid of from his coat, and shoots Lennie in the back of the head. As Lennie falls to the ground and becomes still, George tosses the weapon away and sits down on the riverbank, this is one of the times when it proves the primary point Steinbeck is attempting to percieve: loneliness and isolation."
"Statistical evidence conducted on cases of similar crimes found that African American defendants are over four times as likely to be executed as their White counterparts. A similar study noted that White defendants face almost no chance of execution when their victim is African-American. While African Americans make up only 13% of the U.S. population, over 40% of death-row inmates are African-American. In light of these gross inequalities, the continuation of capital punishment constitutes egregious discrimination. it is also true that those on death row come disproportionately from low-income and high-crime geographic areas. That such areas are disproportionately\u00a0populated by African Americans is a tragic correlation, painting a troubling portrait of a nation that lacks equality."
"She keeps in touch with her mom to get some information about this allegation that she is black, and she comments that she will die from misery if it is all valid. Her mom doesn\u2019t know Desiree\u2019s real parents, so she sends back a mysterious message. Desiree attempts to move Armand\u2019s heart one final time, however without any result, since he enables them to leave, which in a sense means that he abandons them from now on. Desiree doesn\u2019t think straight anymore, since she cherishes Armand more than herself and their son. Desiree ignores that she and her child are human and they have the right to proceed onward, and she chooses to murder herself and her infant."
"About half of the total students in OECD countries are from the developing world. It is estimated that almost in every 10 tertiary educated grown-ups, who was born in the developing world, was living in U. S. Australia, Canada, or Western Europe in the year 2001. As shown by studies of World Bank and IMF, there is high correlation between talented people with sound education and legal migration. The rate of legal educated migrants is 4% higher now than it was ten years ago (37% and 33% respectively)."
"A penetration into the middle class could prevent their children from experiencing social inequality of the same magnitude but unfortunately, their kids are not born into that much luck. Karen and McClelland conclude that the odds of achieving success are heavily dependent on luck and structural circumstances. The achievement ideology does not at all teach this reality. They explain that, lifestyle choices matter but are greatly inferior to the larger social setting that we all inhabit. The United States has many programs to help lower income people, those who need help due to drugs, etc. but many things are limited as politics and times change. This changes what resources are available for people like these men. Karen and McClelland refer back to Bourdieu. The given society determines what takes place in it. If the Brothers and hallway Hangers lived elsewhere their life experiences\u00a0would be different. Another thing is that social structures set up choices and influence choices as well."
"Racism had existed throughout human history. It is regularly defined as the detestation, or belief that someone is less than human, because of skin color, place of birth, and mores. All of these arguments are based on a false understanding of race; in fact, some contemporary scientists could argue that the classification of races used today is inadequate, and that there are more meticulous and proper ways of categorizing humans. What may seem to be considerable \u201cracial\u201d differences to some people, such as skin color, hair, and facial shape, are not of much scientific significance. It has been said that there have been greater biological differences between people of the same race than if we were to compare the same trait to a different race. One philosopher writes: \u201cThere are few genetic characteristics to be found in the population of England that are not found in similar proportions in Zaire or in China\u2026.those differences that most deeply affect us in our dealings with each other are not to any significant degree biologically determined.\u201d"
"Discrimination, as with cultural racism, on the basis of culture and ethnicity considers some minorities and cultures as intrinsically undesirable or inferior. Hostility or Anti-Semitism toward Jews as an ethnic or religious minority persists from the medieval times when the Jews were generally the only non-Christian minority that existed in Europe. Jews, expelled from their nations or murdered, stripped of property, penalized with high taxes, compelled for living in ghettos secluded from the Christians, and generally forbidden from practising majority of the professions and trades, strived for hundreds of years against prejudice and injustice of the Christian societies."
"The story is all about the mother moth and her child. Mother moth told the baby moth not to go in the fire because it is very dangerous, despite of the ignorance of the baby moth he ignored the warning of his mother, and he went to the fire. He flies and played around the fire. His eagerness to go near to the fire leads him to get burned and die. This story was never forgotten by Rizal when he was growing older and become a hero at his time. Rizal became a courageous and a bravery man at his time because of the traits that he develops in his growing stage with the help of his family especially his mother and father."
"Dodong did not object, but tried to make Blas think twice before rushing to marriage \u2013 because Dodong doesn\u2019t want Blas to end up like him. It simply tells the story of an older person who made a mistake in the past who ended up with a not so pleasurable life. Then he had a son who is like him when he was young. His son is hasty in making the decision to get married, just like he was when he was 17. Despite this, Dodong did not \u2013 and could not \u2013 stop Blas from marrying Tona. Therefore, he didn\u2019t object. Instead, he just reminded him that Blas is still very young and might as well think twice before rushing to marriage. But, as the ending goes: \u201cYouth must triumph\u2026 now. Love must triumph\u2026 now. As long ago did youth and love triumphed for Dodong. And then\u2026 life."
"\u201cI feel used,\u201d Mira raged on the phone the other night. \u201cI feel manipulated and discarded. This 8 is such an unfair way to treat a person who was invited to stay and work here because of her talent. My employer went to the LN. S. and petitioned for the labor certification. For over 30 years, I\u2019ve invested my creativity and professional skills into the improvement of this country\u2019s preschool system. I\u2019ve obeyed all the rules, I\u2019ve paid my taxes, I love my work, I love my students, I love the friends I\u2019ve made. How dare America now change its rules in midstream?"
"I feel Slim uses his power to his advantage when he tells Curley to say that his hand got caught in a machine, he shows kindness to George and Lennie and true understanding of Lennie\u2019s condition being physical and mental as he has been informed by George when he confides in him and his strength when he is moving the big bags of hay on the ranch. I feel that you see the strength of Slim\u2019s character when Curley\u2019s wife has died."
"The benefit of giving love to others is that it appeals to our heart and makes us connected to others, provides stability and security, removes fear and gives a feeling of being good towards other people. One can get to know love by first generating such feelings of being good to others. How can a person feel love from others if he is filled with ego, anger and selfish tendencies? These negative emotions suppress inner urge to love others."
"Irecently had a student come to me who was dealing with domestic violence. Her husband who had attempted to commit suicide and once his attempt failed he then proceeded to beat on his wife in front of their young son and goddaughter. I couldn\u2019t fathom being in her shoes. Physically I couldn\u2019t do anything to her but I that words are one of the most powerful weapon we have, so I gave her what I could and that was advice. I advised her that since both she and her husband both refused to leave the house that she find someone she trusted to look after her son until she was able to do so, I informed her that one of the worst things a child can see is there parent being abused ( I know from experience) and that with him being a male that is the last thing he should witness so that when he becomes of age the cycle of abuse wouldn\u2019t continue."
"Dyad parenting plays an important role in the molding of the person\u2019s identity and social concept. Each sex in parenthood contributes to the development of their children by either negative or positive reinforcements. In the case of single parent, the absence of the other parent greatly impairs the normal and ideal cycle of child development. Single-parent families usually conjure negative psychological, emotional, and identity needs among children especially if this situation occurs in the period of pre-adolescent"
"It also provides families to understand child growth and developmental opportunities that can help reduce problems such as poor health, dropout rates, poverty, and crime, by establishing a lifelong love for learning, and a positive attitude toward the world that surrounds the most important years (Twright, 2018). Investment in schooling is a pre-request mean of improving economic growth and well-being of societies."
"2013 has been embossed by recent incidents such as a Vegas shooting that ended the lives of three people, four gruesome murders in Orange County in California, and many more tragedies. It is estimated that there are 300 million guns in personal hands in the US today, many legally owned and others not (Neyfakh). Every year, close to four million guns find their way into the market (Nicolas and Nelson). This level of gun infiltration is alarming; it means that even the Supreme Court would find it hard to locate or seize these guns."
"Though the fact that the police used lethal force against a Black woman with mental illness when it was not necessary is a violence loaded with racism that needs to be combated, much of the problem starts way before this point, at the point in which we make racist and sexist assumptions about Rosser\u2019s position. As I have mentioned, all the sources I have found say nothing of the situation before the cops arrived. Because of the fact that Rosser had a knife and her boyfriend felt threatened enough to call the cops, as well as the way our patriarchal society is organized in which a man is the head of the household, should exert control over a female partner, and whose voice should be recognized, she gets no say in the story."
"It was an \u201ceye opening\u201d project and I truly enjoyed it. After I had time to process it, I kind of chuckled at myself about it. I know that a few of that added to me being raised in the South and my childhood of \u201chow\u201d white people or European American\u2019s should not be relied on all the method, which some leaning more toward European males must not be relied on."
"In the passage, Michael says, \u201cA women stepped into the shelter. She was nicely dressed, despite the weather, and she was carrying shopping bags\u00b7 Francis was taking two spaces on the bench, and he moved so she could sit, but she looked deliberately away\u00b7 She left walking down the street, maybe to the next shelter, her heels clicking on the sidewalk\u201d (120)."
"It was the summer of 2005 and I decided to work voluntarily as a financial specialist for a nonprofit organization. I was tasked to help manage the finances of a public hospital. However, my duties went beyond financial matters as I, together with 40 other volunteers, helped the elderly in a variety of chores such as cleaning their rooms and preparing their meals. I observed the elders suffering from dementia; up-to-date facilities and medicines were what they needed."
"Coca-Cola in Canada is a family business which operates in 10 provinces in Canada. It has 6200 employees in over 50 facilities. They manufacture, market, sell and distribute Coca-Cola products. Coca-Cola offers a wide variety of beverage brands, many of which come in no-calorie and low-calorie options. These beverages include sparkling soft drinks, still waters, juices and fruit beverages, sports drinks, energy drinks, and ready-to-drink teas. Its popular brands in Canada including Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Coca-Cola\u00ae Zero Sugar, Coca-Cola Life, Sprite, Fanta, NESTEA, POWERADE, Minute Maid, Dasani, and vitamin water."
"One such organization that can be severely affected by poor time management is the Marine Corps and as a Marine, I have failed the organization due to my inefficient use of time. However, one can always learn from one\u2019s mistakes and I have learned from mine. While I did mismanage my time a couple of times, I have since learned the importance of time management as it pertains to the Marine Corps and recognized the errors of my ways."
"Metaphors are another language device Shakespeare uses to display the Capulets as medieval parents. For example Lady Capulet irritatingly says to Juliet \u201cI would the fool were married to her grave\u201d .The point Shakespeare is making is that traditional medieval parents were very cold and unpleasant if they didn\u2019t get their way. The quote above means that if Juliet does not marry Paris the thing for her to do is die, her parents will feel shameful and deeply insulted if she rejects Paris, as Paris\u2019s family will no longer respect the Capulets."
"The death penalty should be eliminated due to the types of drugs used, the issue of race in sentencing, it is morally wrong, and the mentally ill cannot get a fair trial. The type of drugs in these executions are suspect. The race of the offender can play a large role in their sentencing and this is a big deal when deciding whether or not this person has the right to keep on living. The death sentence itself is morally wrong because humans have no right to \u201cplay God\u201d and decide whether or not to take the life of other human beings."
"After the marriage, these women were separated through a guarded chamber, but their freedom was always retained. During this era, concubines were the least feminine class looked upon between legal wives and prostitutes. The role of concubines was even recognized by Athenian law, which comprised the legitimacy and freedom of lineage produced through her. However, with a clear picture, the Athenian law towards these concubines was much more inclined to the benefits of patriarchal society by having their sexual needs filled (Witherington 11)."
"One strategy I have developed as a tutor is viewing each student that visits the Tutoring Center as \u2018not another tutee\u2019, but as a unique individual with his or her own strengths and weaknesses. When a new student comes in for tutoring, I introduce myself and then ask his or her name."
"All he ever did was try and make the king happy. For instance, he said, \u201cWhen the King wants something done, I do it\u201d. I think Cromwell said this because he did not want his head to be cut off; therefore, all he did was kiss up to the king. In the end, it did not help him because he was tried and found guilty of treason. One character that did not get tried for treason was Richard Rich. He was one of the characters that betrayed Sir Thomas More. Throughout the film it was obvious to the viewer Richard Rich only cared about himself. By far, his worse act of selfishness was when he lied and sold out Thomas More for he could become Attorney General of Wales. As a result, I think Rich was a piece of scum for doing such acts of treachery to an old friend. I also believe Thomas More thought so because he said, \u201cRichard, it profits a man nothing to trade his soul for the whole world, but for Wales\u201d."
"This consequently repealed the Missouri Compromise by allowing slavery to spread North of the Missouri Compromise latitude line if popular sovereignty called for it. Popular sovereignty led to a series of deadly confrontations, known as Bleeding Kansas, between anti-slavery Free-Staters and pro-slavery Border Ruffians. In an attempt to establish Kansas as a free state, anti-slavery organizations such as the New England Emigrant Aid Company convinced thousands of anti-slavery Northerners to settle in the new territory for the sole purpose of casting anti-slavery ballots."
"The very \u2018preoccupation with recording the history of childhood is a sign of the waning of childhood\u2019 Postman (1983) p.5, these recordings all indicate a preference to the disappearance rather than a general change in attitudes due to other changes in society. The fear of childhood disappearing is very distinct since parents of children in the recent era had very different upbringings and childhood\u2019s themselves."
"A doctor is being unethical if he/she treated the patients differently based on their skin colour, religion, sexual orientation for example. Although the doctors did not show explicitly that they had treated Henrietta differently, misdiagnosing a patient and not taking responsibility out of it is considered a \u201ccrime\u201d in contemporary medical field and they should not did that to Henrietta. The structural inequality faced by Henrietta had led her to health disparities."
"Cultural diversity is a big part of the community I was raised in and apart of today. Many people spend their whole lives surrounded by one race or culture, but I grew up surrounded by many. Having been raised in a society influenced and shared by so many different races, I had very little idea about what or why racism existed in the world. Having never been taught and seeing very little racism growing up I believed benefited me, today and benefited my future."
"When speaking \u201cBlack English, you have confessed your parents, your youth, your school, your salary, your self-esteem, and, alas, your future\u201d (Baldwin 110) according to Baldwin. People associate language with background which then leads to choose to treat that specific person a talk to him a way they associate with the people who speak that exact same language. In this case, for the minority, it is language that assumes their behavior, but for the other dominant group, it is identity that shapes behavior. It is their identity that tells them that a specific language must be allocated with that specific type of person and then treat them in the way it is conventions set. People speak a specific language because it is in their identity to do so, and they choose to treat people differently according to language. This allows me to conclude that identity defines language, and language triggers behavior."
"Gloria Anzaldua is a strong activist when it comes to the connection between language and identity. In her essay \u201cHow to Tame a Wild Tongue\u201d she outlines her strong emotional arguments about the ability for one to conform to a society by disposing their own language or identity. Your identity is determined by language, the language you speak is a part of your culture, and your culture is what defines a person because of their beliefs, norms and values. Even though there will always be Linguistic Terrorism and suppression, it is important to remember that your language is what makes you who you are and changing from one language to another is something you must do but that doesn\u2019t mean you let that change your true language or your true identity."
"Therefore implying that the boy was inferior and unimportant to him because he was black. This created a barrier in the normally trusting relationship that Teddy and Gideon shared, forcing Gideon to distance himself from the boy becoming for the first time in the story as black and white,. Teddy also changed and realised superiority over Gideon;"
"Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness. \u201d Elizabeth stands out and draws people\u2019s attention with her good looks and is treated with higher respect and affection, because of this, she then learns to treat others with the same respect, as she grows older. This is not unconditional love. Frankenstein is not loved unconditionally either, but instead of being loved for good looks, he is hated as a result of bad looks and as the creature grows older, he learns to treat people with the same hate."
"The men were hiding out along a river called Salinas, across from the Gabililan mountains. Trouble occurred in Weed when Lennie grabbed a hold of a ladies dress, because he was curious about the texture of the fabric. The woman took it the wrong way and became upset and frightened. Curdling screams caused some men to come rushing to the aid of the woman. Lennie then became frightened and ran away. George was such a supportive and understanding friend that he ran away with him."
"He believes that stigmatizing overeating in children will be a feasible solution to end the increasing epidemic of childhood obesity. However, Critser has several problems linked to his simple solution to a very complex problem. First, Critser doesn\u2019t talk about the discrimination and the rude treatment that people struggling with obesity face. Second, he claims American families are to blame for this epidemic, but really parents are the ones who are held responsible for their children\u2019s eating behaviors in the first place."
"People ranging from Gilbert Collar, a white man, to Eric Garner, an African American, were wrongfully killed by the police however, these officials have not been indicted, just put on suspension. Just last week an African American man named Philando Castile was shot unreasonably by a police officer who stopped him for a broken headlight the day after another African American man named Alton Sterling was shot and killed by police. This fueled the \u201c#BlackLivesMatter\u201d movement even more when the two tragedies led to the fatal shootings of five officers in Dallas and major protests of about two hundred people on Interstate 94 (Helsel, Fieldstadt, Grimson, The Associated Press 2016)."
"There was also the loss of their culture to be considered which essentially meant the loss of their identity. The reverend who runs the school even used an analogy of knocking the old soil from a plant\u2019s roots to help it grow to justify taking the children from their families and way of life and forcing them to forget about their heritage. Even when they got to the schools some of the other children were being cruel as any of the other people who ran the school. Which made the children even more confused that one of their own kind could be so cruel. The teachers were also constantly beating up the kids."
"Both women are shown disrespect by their husbands. \u201cI didn\u2019t know as what his wife wanted made much difference to John\u201d said by Hale, a acquaintance of John Wright, clearly tells us that Mr. Wright didn\u2019t consider anything from Mrs. Wright weather it\u2019s her feelings about something or an opinion. Similarly, In the short story John calls his wife names like \u201cpoor little girl\u201d or \u201cmy little goose\u201d, his attitude towards her ideas or thoughts is expressed as one\u2019s attitude towards a child or towards someone who doesn\u2019t know any better, like she doesn\u2019t know anything."
"More refuses again and Rich\u2019s violent behaviour and badgering spark fright in More\u2019s family, who try to convice More to have Rich arrested. More believes the idea of this is infallible because Rich has not broken the law. King Henry visits More personally in an attempt to receive his approval, as the approval of a man with such an honest and moral reputation would be sure to make the King\u00a0feel moral as well. However More is unable to discard his conscience, telling the King: \u201cThis is my right arm. Take your dagger and saw it from my shoulder, and I will laugh and be thankful, if by that means I can come with Your Grace with a clear conscience\u201d. Once again he is portrayed as a man of irrefutable morality, in that he won\u2019t approve of something he believes is wrong by the law, or unacceptable by God."
"But first to look how they discuss domestic violence as the cause for low social status, the lack of economic resources is clearly associated with domestic violence against women. But it is how we see one leading to the other that they discuss. Walby & Allen purpose that maybe it is the other way around. For example that poverty and low social status are the consequences of domestic violence. Women who leave behind their homes and partners in order to escape violence will be much more ikely to be poorer as a consequence of the loss of their home and of their partner\u2019s income (Walby &Allen, 2004)."
"When holding a conversation with a child and they only use a few words you could help them extend their language by using their words and adding some more words on. Giving children the time and opportunity to communicate \u2013 it\u2019s important to give children time to process what has been said to them and if they don\u2019t answer straight away don\u2019t answer for them, allow them time to respond. Some children will require you to sound words out for them but then you must get them to copy you and blend the sounds together whilst giving them time to\u00a0process what you are telling them. Facilitating communication between children and each other \u2013 in my setting we have registration twice a day for the toddlers and the pre-schoolers this allows the children to communicate between each other and learn how to take turns whilst in small groups, it also provides an activity that has proven to be a husge success through repetition, children now understand and recognise their name, shapes, colours, months of the years, day and date. The children learn to take turns in walking up and retrieving their name from the board and all get turns in naming the colour, shape etc \u2026.."
"Seiter (2003) pointed out that \u201cBehind My Little Pony and Ghostbusters toys stand developments and strategies now institutionalized in the US toy industry today; deseasonalization, the encouragement of toy buying at times other than the Christmas season; character licensing, the use of popular fictional characters for a fee or a share of the profits as the design or decoration on toys; consumer research, in the form of test marketing; and line extensions, new characters and accessories added to successful toys (Seiter, 2003, p. 194).\u201d This idea points to the changing social condition which Toys R Us, through its intuitive marketing acumen, took full advantage of."
"Without these methods of exploring and celebrating a diverse range of cultures and beliefs children may become closed off to the views of others. Children and families who are in the minority may feel segregated or excluded. Children who feel this way may then develop feelings of anxiousness and unease, which in turn will have an adverse effect on their ability to socialise and their academic development."
"Replacement refers to technologies or approaches which replace or avoid the use of animals in experiments. There can be a full replacement or a partial replacement. A full replacement avoids the use of any research animals. It includes the use of human volunteers, tissues and cells, mathematical and computer models, and established cell lines. A partial replacement includes the use of some animals that, based on current scientific thinking, are not considered capable of experiencing suffering. This includes invertebrates such as worms and social amoebae, and immature forms of vertebrates."
"Lennie is described using animal imagery. Animals have a low intelligence level just like Lennie, he cannot think for himself \u2018the way a bear drags his paws\u2019. Animals are commonly found in packs, if they are left without their pack they become very vulnerable to other animals, George is like Lennie\u2019s pack, this will give Lennie a sense of insecurity as he knows that he cannot survive by himself. He is constantly asking for Georges approval, he relies on George over everything \u2018Where we goin\u2019, George\u2019."
"Psychological research therefore suggests that infants differ in the type of attachment they form with the caregiver. In an attempt to measure more attachment behaviour, Ainsworth (1967) conducted an experiment known as \u2018strange situation\u2019. This experiment involved observing the infants reactions when he/she is separated from the parent, and observing how the infant reacts to a stranger and how, on the parents return, the infants then responded to their parents."
"My best friends are the most tremendous friends I could ever ask for. I can talk to them about anything, or not say anything at all. We support each other in what the other does. We can be apart for so long but when we see each other again, it\u2019s like they never left. I think that friendship is more essential than romantic love. You have the comforts that only a best friend can give you, the care and concern from friends, and even if you lose or grow apart from a friend, it can help you become a better friend."
"Clearly showing the United States is greatly affected by the death penalty. By the absence of the money needed for jobs, it has been forced to cut jobs strongly needed to protect society. As it can be seen, all the money spent on the death penalty is crucially affecting the economy. The process of following through the death penalty is lengthy; an entire appeal process can take more than 15 years before executions take place and in some cases it never goes through. \u201cSentences or convictions can be reversed, defendants may die of natural causes or suicide, governors occasionally grant clemency, and entire statutes can be overturned by the courts.\u201d (Dieter 28). Meaning, most of the sentences don\u2019t result in an execution, which only consumed an exaggerated amount of money when the process is over. Not only is the appeal high priced, pre-trials and trials only add much more money to the high amount already accumulated. Instead of finding a more appropriate approach, society spends millions of dollars into a system that doesn\u2019t produce results. Although many citizens do believe the death penalty is effective, they also believe the price is worth it. \u201cThis is because life is invaluable; there is no amount of money or prison that could equal it\u201d (Roberts \u2013Cady 3)."
"This comment is similar to the quote made by one employee at Cityside who stated, \u201cWhen a white man disagrees, he\u2019s being strong. He\u2019s taken with respect. When a black man disagrees, he\u2019s being negative and whiny, militant and kind of like Malcolm X.\u201d Both quotes show that while the companies made strides as far as diversifying their employee base, there is still a great difference in the way the ideas and contributions of white and minority employees are perceived."
"When new foods are introduced to infants, they should be presented individually to encourage infants to taste and accept individual flavors. Infants should have a variety of fruits and vegetables of different colors. Infants should be introduced to one new food every three to five days to help identify food allergies and/or intolerances. When infants start being introduced to new foods, it would be good to coordinate with parents and serve that same food that the child has already tried."
"Natural hairstyles, such as the afro, and African clothing, such as the dashiki, gained popularity. More importantly, the African American aesthetic encouraged personal pride and political awareness among African Americans. Music [pic] Men playing the djembe, a traditional West African drum adopted into African American and American culture. The bags and the clothing of the man on the right are printed with traditional kente cloth patterns. African American music is rooted in the typically polyrhythmic music of the ethnic groups of Africa, specifically those in the Western, Sahelean, and Sub-Saharan regions."
"The ocular individuality is completed by in writing design harmonizing to our trade name pyramid. It should be \u2018aesthetically delighting, connect with the audience on rational and emotional degrees, and supply them with pertinent information \u2018 ( Hembree, 2006 ) . It is of import that the transmitter of message and the receiving system speak the same ocular linguistic communication."
"Any inequality and discrimitation should be challenged to guarantee fairness, decency and respect beteween students. Creating a safe and relaxed enviroment, learners will be more motivated and focused, able to participate, voice their opinions, ask questions and be actively involved in determining how they will learn, allowing them to use their potential and achieve their goals."
"He considered them as one art, all attempting to find the perfect Pythagorean aesthetic ratios. \u2022 The third area of Yeats\u2019 reflection was his view of himself as a lover. Beset by love for one woman for many years, Yeats describes the intimate feeling when his beloved grants him a vision of the life that she led prior to their meeting. Segment 3: Yeats\u2019 Philosophical Thoughts (6:08) ________________________________________ \u2022 According to Plato\u2019s myth of creation, originally everyone was once half of a sphere."
"Naturalism is the final literary element that completely mends the concept of Petry\u2019s story together. Naturalism is the theory that ethical statements and actions can be brought forth by unethical ones, \u201cEach person inherits compulsive instincts especially hunger, the drive to accumulate possessions, obsession with status, and sexuality and is then subjected to the social and economic forces in the family, the class and the milieu into which that person is born\u201d (Ann Petry and The Street, D2L November 2, 2018). To expand on this, Petry uses this story to portray the harsh struggles black women face in the 1940s and 1950s. Not only are they suffering from the poor treatment due to their gender and skin color, they are also suffering from the male patriarchy. Petry depicts this by exploiting the truth about the cruel reality of being a single mother in the city of Harlem."
"My husband is a Marine which is a full time job. I am a student, a mother, and have been able to balance a part time job as well. With our busy schedules being able to sit down and talk for at least ten minutes a day, like the article states, is something that we had never considered doing. As I read this article my husband was in the room with me. I decided to read it aloud so that he could grasp the concept of self-disclosure just as I was."
"The Victorian era was a time bound by Social Conventions; female adulterers were shunned by society and treated like pariahs, whereas male adulterers were not in fear of getting this treatment. There were many double standards set between men and women in that era, some of these remain even now."
"Humanity will not survive global warming if we don\u2019t figure out a way to fix it quickly. If we really needed to stop global warming, countries would need to sign treaties and contracts to prevent carbon dioxide from being produced as fast as it is right now. Global warming is when the global average temperature rises due to carbon emission getting trapped in our atmosphere. Global warming is irreversible at this point because it would take over a decade for us to even tell if we fixed it."
"In this essay I am going to analyse the dramatic techniques that Arthur Millar uses in his 20th century drama called, \u2018A View From The Bridge. \u2018 The play is set in Brooklyn in the 1940\u2019s when the Italians were immigrating to America to find work as they were poor and they needed to get away from Italy to find work to feed their families in Italy. Many of these immigrants entered America Illegally. The play is about a skilled docks worker in Brooklyn named Eddie Carbone."
"Didion makes self-respect all about other people and what they have done you to and how you have become this way as a direct result of failures or trauma. I do not agree with Didion\u2019s opinion of self-respect in this post because self-respect is about the individual, not anyone else."
"1. To attract young, new hires, college career fairs allow an employer to target people of color and women who may be good potential employees. 2. Employee referral programs: good employees typically associate with other good potential friends and associates. By implementing a program where employees refer other good candidates, employers can identify and reach out to others of the same race or background. 3. Recruitment: enlightened employers know that they need to take a hard look at their own tactics for generating diverse job candidates. These organizations take a serious look at their internal assessment around recruiting. With this, employers target key groups of employees and then mentor them so that they are able to navigate the system successfully."
"He argues that this is what is happening in America in terms state of race relations because the white individuals has manipulated, corrupted the minds of other ethnic groups. During, the Tocqueville writing period Native Americans were seen as savages and African-Americans were seen as properties, in hard labour. He argues that both race groups were seen as dispute, dispossessions, and considered as inhuman. Ethnic groups were viewed as part of the animal kingdom he believes the reason why they were treated like an animals. For instance he describes the \u201cEuropean[s][ as the top] man of other races is to [make] them animals? [White Europeans] serve his purpose and when he cannot bend them he destroys them\u201d In other words, Tocqueville implies that perhaps no-one from white race will ever sympathises with the two ethnic races, so it was acceptable for any white individual to do whatever they intended to do with native Americans and African-Americans because their race, their lives were seen as irrelevant, unimportant living in the land of America. Both ethnic minority groups did not have any rights or equalities like the white individuals did. Tocqueville see Native Americans and African-Americans (slaves) are connected to democracy because they were both socially excluded part of\u00a0democracy side of society. Tocqueville argues that opinions like this then leads to democracy being based on the idea slavery of African-Americans viewing it as satisfactory. Democracy subsidises the idea of racial segregation, racial superiority and divisions of races which he suggests could be a great danger to society."
"The LSM demonstrates that just 6% or 1 of every 17 houses is in the base LSM 1-3 gathering, the SEM demonstrates that 44% or 1 out of 2.3 family units are battling. As far as the critical LSM 8-10 gathering, which gets more than 70% of promoting spend, the SEM additionally beats the LSM with 19% of families versus 14% for the LSM. As far as authenticity, the SEM likewise has numerous focal points over the LSMs. With 14 factors, versus the 29 on LSMs, overviews are shorter and simpler to oversee. SEMs are likewise steadier, this is on the grounds that there is less dependence on durables and more dependence on family unit structures and open foundation, which change all the more regularly."
"Education is a major issue when living in poverty. Children who raise in poverty don\u2019t have the opportunity to attend school. This can lead to a person\u2019s lifelong struggle. This mostly affects young children. Millions of children in Asia and Africa Don\u2019t have the chance to go to school. This reason is also because of hunger. \u201c66 million primary school-age children attend classes hungry across the developing world, with 23 million in Africa alone (Samir).\u201d Being hunger ruined children\u2019s brains. Their brain doesn\u2019t develop properly and concentrate on things. They have to walk to school without food and they also have to help out in the house or family to make a living for their families. That what keeps them away from school. Children in America has the opportunity to attend school at a young age. A lot of students in America dislike school; this is mostly High School students. High School students hate school is mostly because of homework, things they were forced to learn and their interest. Now, that a whole different reason between the countries. There are also other side of not attending school in America. Those who didn\u2019t finish school and drop out were living in poverty and there is a reason for that. Family problems, low income, and even stuff like depression or stress. When children have no access to education, they don\u2019t have the knowledge to know what\u2019s happening around them."
"To seek new insights; to ask questions and assess phenomena in a different perspective in relation to what others have done on the topic. It will educate us about value diversity and equal opportunity. We will understand how to challenge assertively expressions of stereotyping, discrimination and prejudice. Develop a responsible attitude towards person relationships. 2.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY"
"At this point of his life Delaney is being bombarded with a number of incidents that cause him to formulate a dislike and anger toward Mexican immigrants. Delaney allows what occurs around him to dictate how he reacts to situations. This starts to promote contrast in his liberal views, making him a product of the society and cultural views that surround him. At first attempt to characterize Delaney it took a number of possible traits, and it summed up to: Delaney struggles to be a normal person due to his social awkwardness and lack of common sense, but that was only with part one of The Tortilla Curtain."
"Benjamin is the hero; the incoherent individual that learns an unpleasant lesson due to one event that changed the course of all events prior, (Gordon\u2019s death) Captain Stoltz was the villain; the sadistic, power hungry oppressor with manipulative ways that ended up determining his fate, Johan represented the loyal and resourceful character that led the viewer to believe there was a shed of hope throughout any struggle, and Stanley was the character I\u2019ve seen way too often, the random bystander that provides the cathartic release by ultimately giving the villain what he deserved."
"A good friend is someone who\u2019s there for you when you going through problems. This is someone who will have your back through good or bad times. This person will be there when you need a helping hand. A good friend never back stab a true friend. This is someone who does not sugarcoat the message that he or she is delivering to me. This person is well brought up in a church and stable environment."
"Hoy (1986) also researched this area and used the same animations and cereals as Atkin (1975) but used a different sample of children and added some other research areas. Results that are found in both studies show that \u2018\u2019the type of cartoon, or host, the children viewed significantly affected an attitude change towards the product\u2019\u2019 (Mariea Grubbs Hoy, 1986). There was a difference however in one of the outcomes, Hoy (1986) results showed that the attitude towards the \u2018\u2019Pebbles\u2019\u2019 cereal almost remained unchanged when they had viewed a \u2018\u2019Flintstones\u2019\u2019 cartoon. \u2019 In contrast they liked the cereal more when they had seen the Bugs Bunny Cartoon. If a child likes the product because of the use of animated spokes-characters remains uncertain. Hoy (1986) proposed that the use of an animated character creates a positive attitude towards the product. Acuff and Reither (1997) state that \u2018\u2019A child\u2019s beliefs and desires about a product (or product entity) may be moderated by the child\u2019s affective evaluation of the character\u2019\u2019 5. Attitude towards Brand Preference A study concerning children below 7 years in the United Kingdom researched the impact of television advertising on the children\u2019s wish list for Santa Claus (Nash, 2002). During this study 118 children took part and several factors were examined, among these factors were the amount of time the children were watching television and the proportion of branded and non-branded products requested by children in their letters to Santa Claus."
"The wall project that will stretch 2,000 miles will evidently create more damage but as well be costly and ineffective[12]. $21.6 billion has been a recent cost projection for the construction, with perhaps putting the United States into more debt[13]. This billion-dollar wall will not stop undocumented immigration since those who enter the United States come in with visa and outstay their visit, [outnumbering] those who cross the border without permission[14]. This gives an example of the forthcoming ineffectiveness of this wall that these billions of dollars will go into when comparing it to today\u2019s border fence that hasn\u2019t necessarily stopped undocumented immigrants from coming from the south of the border. Another matter as well, as Josiah McC Heyman explains in their journal, \u201chuman smugglers have apparently kept ahead of the government, despite the post-1993 tactical shifts, added technology, and the buildup of forces\u201d[15]. Such as the picture above, these human smugglers or coyotes as they have been named as, have found ways in the last two decades with smuggling unauthorized immigrants into the United States, despite the increase of money and labor that has been put for the \u201csecuring\u201d of the U.S. \u2013 Mexico border since its construction in 1993[16]. Immigrant individuals or families will give thousands of dollars to these coyotes to sneak them across the border, putting their lives into these individuals\u2019 hands for a better life than the one they had in their home country. In addition, patrolling the extent of this 2,000-mile border wall will need additional border patrol agents. The Trump Administration is considering hiring another 5,000 agents, significantly increasing their budget to hire, train and maintain these agents, with an estimate of $328 million for 2017 and 1.884 billion dollars for the year of 2018[17]. Hiring these much personnel will not come easy, these patrol agent applicants must go through extensive training and tough exams where hiring them can take about seven months[18]. With shortening and easing the processes, however, could do more harm than good since they will not have the adequate training to patrol rough and dangerous terrain. Thus, building this wall as Trump has been consistently vocal about doing will only bring predicaments to the United States economic condition, since this proposed funding will not bring much triumph with stopping undocumented immigrants from coming into the country. With this wall, it would only reflect irrational money waste to the eyes of the national and international public, disregarding other departments such as education and health that would most benefit and outweigh the 20-billion-dollar funding for the greater future of the country."
"For conclusion, it is crystal clear that marriage age in Malaysia should be increased because underage marriage and domestic violence can be avoided, young females\u2019 health can be secured, the youngsters can continue their education without limit, the mental health of the youngsters can be improved, the risk in divorce for underage marriage can be decreased, and also manipulative adults who take on advantages can be put to an end."
"Some people may argue that racial profiling goes against the Constitution and country\u2019s morals. The American Civil Liberties Union argues that \u201c\u2026racial profiling is in every instance inconsistent with this country\u2019s core constitutional principles of equality and fairness\u201d (\u201cShould Racial\u201d). If the American Civil Liberties Union wants everyone to be equal and treated with fairness, then that means protecting everyone equally and fairly. While this may be true in some peoples opinion, \u201c\u2026the president has emphasized that\u2026Federal law enforcement officers who are protecting national security or preventing catastrophic events\u2026may consider race, ethnicity, and other relevant factors to the extent permitted by our laws and the Constitution\u201d (\u201cShould Racial\u201d). Therefore, the use of racial profiling as a tool to protect and prevent in law enforcement is completely legal."
"\u201cRacism\u201d is supposedly the belief one race is superior to another. But those who accuse whites of racism or white supremacy feel morally superior to those whites. You can\u2019t force someone to love you. All people discriminate, and you should be free to do so.\u00a0Blacks were doing quite well in separate schools and businesses. But they were influenced by \u201cleaders\u201d who wanted Integration (1)."
"Throughout the novel, Holden always retreats to his childhood as a coping mechanism for what is really happening in the real world. Holden values childhood throughout the novel, as it was the only time in his life was he felt secure. Holden\u2019s childhood is the most important theme in the novel as it is the only part were the reader can understand Holden and feel a sense of pity for him. Holden childhood was the only place were he was his true self and with the help of Phoebe, his younger sister in which he admires and is the only person he can be his true self around."
"At first their strategy consisted on getting people to support them due to the moral implications; however, they changed their approach and campaigned for the use of social, educational, and political tactics to encourage government control of liquor. Liquor laws were passed due to their inexhaustible effort and backing from the churches. Women like Susan B. Anthony, Frances E. Williard, and Carry A."
"The individuals would favour people in their group rather than the individuals of the other group. In most cases the participants would sacrifice points for their group simply to increase the distinction between the groups. The participants would provide 7 points to their own group and give the other group 1, although they could have given 13 to each group. This shows that you can be quickly be put in a group for a minor thing and you would stick and go versus the other group and see them as the opponent without having any genuine factor."
"But taking that forward motion too far can be a bad thing. Success at the expense of everything else, for example, leads to the opposite of happiness. Life requires balance. And people that understand that there is a balance to work and play, strife and joy, are more in tune with the universe and, therefore, better able to achieve happiness. Life with a dose of humor is more pleasant. Comedians, compared to any other profession, live the longest because they understand that laughter adds the spice to life, and makes daily progress worth the minor tribulations."
"That can often cause the successful person to have a hard time having sympathy for those people. But what most of those individuals who weren\u2019t fortunate enough to make out of the hard times want is empathy from a person who made it out of poverty, they don\u2019t want any one to feel sorry for them because they most likely don\u2019t know any other way of living so they cant miss what they never had. As was the case with Lawino and her\u00a0husband she didn\u2019t want his sympathy or anyone else, she just expected Orcol to understand her situation and respect her more since there struggles were similar prior to his University education and it probably hurts especially because they are married."
"While in Dr. Smith\u2019s waiting room I perused a copy of Psychology Today which referenced an essay by William Brennan called \u201cYour Dog Feels No Shame: The Myth of Canine Guilt.\u201d Mr. Brennan offered a short corrective to the general view that dogs don\u2019t feel guilt. Mr. Brennan cites the work of Dr. Alexandra Horowitz. He writes, \u201c\u2026 according to Alexandra Horowitz, a dog-cognition expert at Barnard College, what we perceive as a dog\u2019s guilty look is no sign of guilt at all.\u201d However, it may or may not be."
"For many years, animals have been used in research both in the scientific and medical fields. In order to introduce new drugs into the market, they have to be tested first on animals in order to ascertain whether they are effective or not. Animal experimentation in this context defines the use of non-humans, mostly animals, to test new drugs and consumer goods such as cosmetics, pesticides, herbicides, food additives, among others (Taylor 120). Pharmaceutical companies and research institutions have been active in animal experiments because these institutions are charged with coming up with new drugs."
"The last category consists of cyber crimes in which the use of a computer or computer system is incidental to the commission of the crime. This category includes, for example, instances in which a murderer uses a com\u00adputer to plan a murder or lure the victim to the murder scene; it can also include a blackmailer\u2019s using a com\u00adputer to write extortion letters to his victim or a drug dealer\u2019s using a computer to monitor his sales, inventory and profits. Here, the computer is merely a source of evidence and new substantive criminal legislation is generally not needed. The cases in this category can, however, require new law to resolve procedural issues such as the processes used in gathering evidence of cyber crimes."
"The show had low ratings, but its popularity soon increased and by the end of the third series the show had achieved decent ratings in the UK. It also aired in BBC America and surprisingly had a little success. Friends is an American sitcom created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, which aired on NBC from September 22, 1994 to May 6, 2004. The series revolves around a group of friends in Manhattan. Filming for the series took place at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California in front of a live studio audience."
"In modern world, there are so many people that couldn\u2019t stand not going to the dentist ever again. They depend on them to keep up with the oral hygiene, clean their teeth and get X-rays. From Dental Assistants to Dental Hygienists and Dentists, they are always willing to help you. People in the dentist office always advise to you how important it is to keep up with regular cleanings at least twice a year, and brush and floss your teeth daily. If you do not take care of your teeth, it could lead to bad things like oral cancer and Periodontal Disease. The Dental Hygienists are the\u00a0ones to help you prevent these things from happening. If you ask any person in this field if they enjoy their job, I know most would say yes. There is nothing more than a better feeling wake up every day knowing you are going to help someone. Although this career takes a lot of skills and education, it is worth it in the end. Most hygienists are aware that there are \u2018better\u2019 jobs out there that make a good amount of money, (a lot more than theirs) they would not trade it for anything else. Of course this is why it is such a growing field. This really shows that they truly love what they do. If there are any traits or skills listed above that fits you then this may be your career of choice. Over the years since researching this field, I have learned so much from it. There is good pay, they are flexible with you if you have a family and want to work part time. I think this job is perfect for anyone honestly. This is such a dynamic job to have. There are some things you must research before going into this job. How long does it take for? you to become a Dental Hygienist, what is the pay and availability in your area, and what is the total cost of the program. Although these may be stressful things to think about, but is very important to look into these things before going into this career. (ONETOONLINE, 2014)"
"Through my own personal experiences, I have found out that I am an activist, that inside me that wants to find a solution to this all but know it will not be easy. I started to protest on May 1 2006, La Gran Marcha (May Day). (\u201c2006 United States Immigration Reform Protests.\u201d) I was in the 6th grade and at just 11 years old I knew this was huge and it had to be done. We were primarily standing up for \u201cA day without Immigrants\u201d. This was to show the United States how much of an impact hard working immigrant make on the daily. Whether it was to support farm field workers, Latin restaurants or any restaurant in general since mostly Latino\u2019s work as dishwashers or cooks, it didn\u2019t matter we all came together as one to march in importance of this topic. It was one of the best experiences of my life and I thank my parents for allowing me to experience something that went down in History."
"Where would we be without ethnic studies today? Without the efforts and sacrifices of those student protesters, someone like me might not even appreciate and understand the struggle that so many went through. We stand on the shoulders of those who dared to challenge injustice and discrimination, and broke the barriers of race and racial equality."
"There is racial anxiety and ambivalence in this stage and individuals must deal with moral dilemmas about racial issues and has to choose between either becoming involved with other individuals from different racial and ethnic identities or maintain the status quo (Leach, 2006). One example of my own development in this stage would be when I started school. I had never really been around anyone else from another race before I went to school. I remember asking my parents about the other kids that looked different than me. My parents then explained to me that there are kids too, just like me and that they shouldn\u2019t be treated any differently. I chose to become friends with other children of all races in my class. The third stage, Reintegration, is identified by the \u201cblame-the-victim\u201d attitude and idealization of the White race and denigration of other races (Leach, 2006). In this stage, Caucasians may feel that even though there is White privilege, it is because they deserve it and are in some way superior to other racial groups. The next stage, Pseudo-independence, is the first stage of positive racial identification. Acceptance of other racial groups occurs during this stage, but full acceptance is not yet achieved (Leach, 2006)."
"Similar concerns also apply to the Government \u2013 who hold the burden to communicate with the entire, linguistically diverse nation competently and effectively. Government officials, and the President, must therefore be\u00a0certain that their speeches are translated accurately in all languages, as well as all legislation and legal proceedings. If certain laws passed are misunderstood, it could result in civil unrest. During legal proceedings, misunderstanding could even result unfair prosecution."
"Volunteer your time to support domestic violence counseling programs and shelters. For domestic violence education , government should expand education and awareness efforts to increase positive attitudes toward nonviolence and encourage individuals to report family violence. Form task forces to evaluate and assess domestic abuse and start to develop an action plan, as well as ways to monitor the progress. Mandate domestic abuse and domestic violence education and training in the public school system, including training for all social services and criminal justice professionals."
"The first day of high school, going to homecoming and prom, learning to drive, graduation, getting a job and starting college, and lastly, buying a first vehicle are some of the most exciting and memorable events which occur in the lives of the average American adolescent. However, as if life during the teenage years isn\u2019t complex or chaotic enough, another event has been added to the lives of numerous teens: getting pregnant and becoming a mom. Teen pregnancy by far is not a new issue for American adolescents."
"According to Collins Dictionary, the law is defined as ?a system of rules that a society or government develops in order to deal with crime, business agreements, and social relationships. You can also use the law to refer to the people who work in this system.\u2019 This definition may be deemed as broad or controversial all depending on which society, beliefs and also the school of thought one tends to be on favour of. There are over seven Schools of Jurisprudential Thought according to Cheeseman."
"There are many crimes happen in the world every second, every hour and every day. The causes, effects and solutions to the problems of violent crimes is complicated and the rate of these crimes is the most prominent issue that people are most concerned. Similarity, the justice of some crimes always get much attention from victims and other citizens. In this essay, death penalty becomes a very controversial issue to discuss, many people support it and many people don\u2019t. Personally, I think death penalty is the most ferocious way of punishing a criminal."
"As evident in marriage, family headman always tries to control the sexuality in the family by taking each and every decision by themselves; like mostly families marry their daughters and sons under endogamy system so that their traditional rules and regulation could be saved but there are very rare caese where families allow exogamy marriages as well forming a new culture. Thus, individual roles and status in society are customized through influences of kinship."
"Iago states that \u201cThieves! Thieves! / Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags! / Thieves! Thieves!\u201d (Shakespeare 1.1.81-83). It demonstrates that Iago considers Othello as a thief because Othello has eloped with Desdemona and this elopement is seen as an evil and immoral deed, a miscegenation at that time. The quote also reveals that Iago is using Othello\u2019s background to cause internal conflict within Othello, reflecting the start of Iago\u2019s manipulation of Othello."
"In this chapter Mrs. Williams attempts to make people realize that race is not the same as poverty, and that race is not a breeding ground for disease and exotic entertainment. She separates race from this and a slew of other things that it is associated with. The main goal of Mrs. Williams in this chapter is to get minorities to recognize the racism their up against. As she states though it is hard to get individuals to recognize racism when the very thing, material or not that is subliminally racist, is being endorsed by blacks or other minorities. When we learn how to use our third eye, see through the rhetoric, and gain some type of understanding this is when we will be able to see that racism is not just black on white, and that it comes in many forms. Mrs. Williams also criticizes the idea of racial science in which she describes as nothing more than \u201cthe science of\u00a0stereotypification\u201d."
"Sneaky and scantily clad, Connie deceives her parents on a regular basis. While around her parents Connie dresses conservative and behaves graciously, reversely, in company of her friends she goes for the hooker look and carries herself as if she were a mindless teenage squander. Soon trouble finds it way in this rebellious teen\u2019s life as she become more curious about her developing sexuality. In this exciting short story, Joyce Oates thrilled the reader with an intense built up suspense followed by a promising and thought provoking climax that not even the main character/ Connie could see coming."
"Upbringing is a very strong factor of what influences people to become racist, or to have even slight racial views. In Peekay\u2019s case, he had gone from one extreme to another. At home, Nanny and his best friend were the only people he could call family, besides his mother who spent time at what Peekay called \u201cThe Mental Breakdown Place\u201d. When sent to the boarding school, he wasn\u2019t expecting the black students to dislike him because of his skin color. He saw the black kids as merely bullies, and before they started bullying him hadn\u2019t anticipated them to gang up on him because they were black. This is what caused Peekay\u2019s neutrality with the racist society in which he lived. He gave each person a chance to be a good person, because he had seen the good in different ethnicities to which many people were stubborn to open up their minds."
"The contents of TV plays on TV media will greatly affect children\u2019s mental health. If a child\u2019s long-term television drama is about ghosts and gods, violence and inappropriate circumstances for children, then the child\u2019s mental health will certainly be affected. Also, movies and songs often praise positive energy, so children\u2019s hearts will be very healthy. So the media can affect children\u2019s mental health positively and negatively. whether the piece of media helps removing stigma surrounding mental health."
"The question that this thesis looks to address is about how homeland security\u2019s established policies after 9/11 affected the South Asian American community. How do these policies connect to President Trump\u2019s current policies and initiatives? As we take this journey into answering these questions, I would like to start by discussing why I chose this specific topic as my thesis. Being a south Indian who was born and raised in California, I had never really had anything remotely similar to discriminatory treatment until after September 11."
"Changes surely have occurred even since this book was written 43 years ago. 8. SHELTER: The pygmy shelter is rather simple. It is a wood log framed dome with large leaves stacked like shingle with the top overlying the bottom one to keep out rain. It is the woman\u2019s hut and it is her responsibility to maintain it. It is common for the man to tell the woman to fix a leak at night if he wants to not be bothered by her for anything so that he may sleep. At one point in the book a married couple has an argument and it escalates big time. She starts taking down the hut and packing it in because she is leaving."
"Many advertisements have portrayed different images for women, especially depicting them as sex objects. In \u201cTwo Ways a Woman Can Get Hurt\u201d by Jean Kilbourne, she says \u201cSex in advertising is pornographic because it dehumanizes and objectifies people, especially women\u2026\u201d(420). The advertisements company\u2019s use display women to be used for sex when advertising for certain products. Usually advertisements for cologne use women being or looking sexy to catch the customer\u2019s eye to want to buy the product. Women are human beings that deserve respect for being women. They are made to look sexy and getting attention for dressing and posing this way, yet they are being disrespected and looked down upon for the way they present themselves when going to the club. It does not make sense that a woman can be sexy for an advertisement, but when it comes to her everyday life she cannot express herself in the same way."
"15. 31% of respondents claim stereotyping, discrimination and prejudice is high among students on campus, 11% say no, 45% are saying is fairly high and 13% had no idea. is stereotype discrimination prejudice very high among students on campus| | | Frequency| Percent| Valid Percent| Cumulative Percent| Valid| Yes| 31| 31.0| 31.0| 31.0|"
"My opinion on this matter is simple and goes along with the saying \u201cguns don\u2019t kill people, people kill people. Although gun laws today are becoming stricter, individuals who want to kill or harm others will still be able to do so. Regardless of how hard it is to obtain a firearm, a person can still find other ways to harm others, even without guns. The issue whether or not semi-automatic weapons should be allowed to be sold is something that is understandable and can have a positive effect. These types of weapons should certainly not be used for hunting, and have no reason to be on the streets of our country. The difference in the number of people one can harm or kill is drastically different and can make an overall difference in the number of deaths each year."
"They will no longer think like an average person when the drugs are active and just put into their system. With substance abuse you can no longer speak for yourself the drugs will takeover. They will not be in the right state of mind to do anything. Most crimes are committed under the influence of substance abuse."
"* In your two \u2018details\u2019 paragraphs, never describe each category (column or row) separately. The examiner wants to see comparisons. Try to organise the numbers you highlighted into 2 groups \u2013 one for each paragraph (e.g. highest numbers for all categories together, and lowest numbers together). * Describe / compare the numbers you highlighted \u2013 include at least 3 numbers in each paragraph. * Use the past simple for past years, and \u2018will\u2019 or \u2018is expected/predicted to\u2019 for future years. If no time is shown, use the present simple."
"Most don\u2019t think of the general use of the term. Sometimes it takes a young girl such as Scout to make us realize these things, \u201cNeighbors bring food with death and flowers with sickness and little things in between\u201d (Lee 293). She goes on to say that Boo Radley, their neighbor, had done several nice things to them and they have failed to repay him. They had never talked in their lives yet Scout had the general sense of friendship that she felt the need to be fair and nice to everyone. The second use of the theme trust is probably the most important anyone will ever have to deal with."
"Because no one even called the police, they are not even minimally decent Samaritans, and their actions are monstrous. While the Good Samaritan gives aid they are not obligated to give, the Minimally Decent Samaritan fulfills their minimal obligations. Just as watching a person be murdered and doing absolutely nothing to help is falling below the standard of minimally decent Samaritan, I would have to believe that watching a person starve and doing nothing to help is also monstrous."
"If an employer finds dependents on an employees\u2019 insurance that should not have been covered, the employee is required to pay back medical bills and insurance premiums through payroll deductions (Employer-Sponsored, 2004). Using information from these internal audits employers may notice a slight domestic partner enrollment increase: 0. 1%-0. 3% for gay and lesbian partners and 1. 3%-1. 8% for heterosexual partners. The increase in enrollment does not significantly affect the annual cost to the employer for employer-sponsored benefits provided to domestic partners and their families (Ash and Badgett, 2006)."
"Through ceasing Southern advances and extinguishing their army, the Battle\u00a0of Gettysburg proved to be a tremendously significant turning point in the Great Civil War for the North. Although other major Battles, such as Vicksburg, which gave complete control of the Mississippi River to the North, Gettysburg resulted in more substantial effect in the War. The significance of Gettysburg is shown by the impacts in the Civil War, mainly negatively to the South. The Battle of Gettysburg can be related today because it shows that through perseverance the odds will come in your favor."
"Specifically in Canada and Australia the focus was much wider and from the start multiculturalism included constitutional and land issues and has been about the definition of the nation. This was partly because these countries had a\u00a0continuous and recent history of ethnic communities created by migration usually from different parts of Europe, partly because there were unresolved legal questions to do with the entitlements and status of indigenous people in these countries, and eventually in the case of Canada, also because of the further issue of the rise of a\u00a0nationalist and secessionist movement in French-speaking Quebec."
"Mann\u2019s looked at prevailing winds. He assumed that as the prevailing winds in the UK are from the southwest, and that the high class housing would be located in the south west of the city, whereas industries would be located in the northeast. This is because \u2018modern\u2019 housing was usually found away from the smog and factories because rich people did not want to be inhaling those toxic fumes, whereas poor people had no choice but to live in the poor quality housing near the factories, in the inner city."
"In fact this showering of remnants could be considered as an attempt to make a comet-tail of any constellation but consequently dissolved with time. This can also refers to the futility of any life- immortality of any living being.So, one can explicitly recognize the way Heaney expressed this part of showering remnants with that of his mother\u2019s leaving behind those memories, though they are not gifts but are the only signs of his mother\u2019s with them, creating a kind of luminous emptiness. And finally the stanza contained with the poet\u2019s vision- he gets the visual picture of the tree being heavenly in its presence. I had a visionOf an airy branch- head rising through damp cloud,Of turned-up faces where the tree had stood. (Heaney)Transferring from thought to vision, Heaney then visualized the tree thought to vision, Heaney then visualized the tree to be elevated towards the sky or heaven with its airy branch. Reference to dump-cloud in a way clarifies the grave ambience of that moment, neither provides a clear sky nor a rainy one. Through this heavenly vision, Heaney may have wanted his readers to perceive that it could offer an imaginary space that is capable of releasing the typical concept of creativity."
"Twelfth Night is a romantic comedy, and romantic love is the play\u2019s main focus. Despite the fact that the play offers a happy ending, in which the various lovers find one another and achieve wedded bliss, Shakespeare shows that love can cause pain. Many of the characters seem to view love as a kind of curse, a feeling that attacks its victims suddenly and disruptively. Various characters claim to suffer painfully from being in love, or, rather, from the pangs of unrequited love."
"Moreover, Maintaining Planned Parenthood relieves many women from stress and the amount of burden and difficulties they have to go through within their bodies and society. At the end, Planned Parenthood offers many options for women to feel secure and confident to make the best decision for their life The women is the vessel carrying this child and until this child is ready to come out of her, it is her body, it is her choice, and there are her rights."
"There is a huge importance in keeping your culture alive. Americans regardless of being born in the U.S. need to make an extreme effort to keep their own culture alive in their homes and for the generations to come. The diversity here within America is beautiful and the point made by the author that I can agree to is that regardless of wanting to adopt the American way it is inevitable, because eventually if you don\u2019t adopt the American way the American Way will adopt you."
"To maximize their diverse workforce, the company has a vision statement in place that allows the company to maximize the benefits. The following is the company\u2019s vision statement:The Johnson & Johnson Family of Companies will realize this vision by:\u2022Fostering inclusive cultures that embrace our differences and drive innovation to accelerate growth;\u2022Achieving skilled, high performance workforces that are reflective of the diverse global marketplace;\u2022Working with business leaders to identify and establish targeted market opportunities for consumers across diverse demographic segments; and\u2022Cultivating external relationships with professional, patient and civic groups to support business priorities."
"It got response mostly from female (around 415 replies) more than male (205 replies) with mean age 34 (range from 14 to 85).The test epitomize ninety five questions with inquiries like regardless of whether it\u2019s present love or past, fundamental relationship and furthermore the purpose behind the affection and relationship between their parents in childhood.Following that cantor and shaver (1987) goes on with another investigation on undergraduate students of about 108 with 38 men and70 women (mean age 18) as a class practice and the manner in which they felt in relationship. They were requested to elucidate essential love relationship with 56 agree and disagree items."
"Other things to consider include: \u2022Take time to get to know your partners and their style of working, take their methods into account when planning their involvement. \u2022Respect differences in style. \u2022Make sure that all partners are credited on any branding and publicity (and if you are using their company logo, find out about and adhere to their branding guidelines. Don\u2019t just grab the logo from the website \u2013 ask them for a high res copy). \u2022Respect the fact that your partners have other constraints and responsibilities within their own organisation \u2013 and that your project may not be their top priority."
"\u201d Achebe also suggests the idea that Okonkwo relies on his wives more than we are made to believe. He needs his family just as much as they need him. In Chapter 9, Okonkwo and Ekwefi attend to their sick daughter, who is near to death. Okonkwo really cares for his children and it shows in this chapter, when Achebe tells us about Ekwefi\u2019s unfortunate luck with children. He tells us that Okonkwo goes to see the medicine man when she mourned the death of her second child to see why this was happening."
"Utilitarianism is one of the most powerful and persuasive approaches to normative ethics in the history of philosophy. A consequence-based approach is that intent is irrelevant. The consequence-based reasoning is that \u201cthe end justi\ufb01es the means\u201d it does not matter how you bring about a good consequence, only that the consequence is indeed good. Can we really justify the willful destruction of human embryos by arguing that \u201cthe end justifies the means\u201d (Group.)? Is it acceptable to undermine the dignity of human life in the name of medical progress (Torr)? So, if using an embryo for stem cell research will help us fight disease in the future or help couples have children with no disabilities make using embryos ethical? Is an embryo considered a life (Torr)? Purely in terms of consequence to that individual, there is no way to put greater value on the one than on the other (Peter A. Facione)."
"Anyhow, we were all playing and I had actually no considered Lennie or what he was doing. In the middle of the video game, suddenly Sweet was calling me over to the barn. For a 2nd, I felt she was simply resting. She was laying there, I went near by her and I saw her neck all twisted and her face down in the straw. Lennie did it. Crazy bastard. I understood he was the only one, but from within my mind it was eliminating me. I do not understand why that is, I never seemed like that before. In the back of my mind, I always understood that he would go too far, that he wasn\u2019t safe and needs to not been left alone. But I didn\u2019t wan na believe like that. Now I needed to."
"appearance effects the way that people are viewed within society. The ways that Sandra questions her own identity, such as what does it mean to be a black woman living in a white household, is she still classified as white if her skin colour is black and what effect her skin colour has on who she is and how she views herself have been drawn upon within the speech. These have been linked to how the protagonist in \u2018Does my head look big in this?\u2019 and her friends, school and wider societies reaction when she decides to wear a hijab full time, and the ideas portrayed within the article \u2018Good looks do matter\u2019."
"The noise his friend had made while jumping on the tree brought the bear running to that place. So the unfortunate friends fell on the ground and holding his breath pretended to be dead. The bear sniffed at him for some time and went his way. When the bear had disappeared, the friend on the tree climbed down. He shook his friend and told him that the danger was over. Then he asked, \u201cBy the way, what did the bear say is your ear?. The betrayed friends was really angry."
"Repeating past behaviors, I think this often happens because we have been so comfortable doing so. We get comfortable and settle eventually and have used these patterns whether they were worthy for us or not. We execute this because it\u2019s familiar and humans are creatures of habit. We are not stuck being anyone we don\u2019t want to be. The wondrous power that we all have individual and unique is that nobody is you and nobody is exactly alike. We are all designed differently, and that\u2019s the beauty of who you are. Being unique is the mightiest power that you withhold. You are not a lemon you have to learn how to step into the person that you want to be by understanding that your mind masters your life."
"Another suggestion as to how racism makes it\u2019s way into our heads is through the almighty media. As we grow up, media becomes a factor of our lives whether or not we want it to be, and is also a major source of how racism keeps itself active. Since the 70\u2019s the media has been giving us racial labels, one of the largest supplies coming from crime shows like \u201cLaw and Order\u201d, and \u201cCSI\u201d. When dealing with crime, people of color are reflected in the demarcation of \u201cthem\u201d and \u201cus\u201d. Whites are often represented as the \u201cgood guy\u201d, or the strong, law obeying citizens. They often target people of color, sometimes without any sort of evidence. Directors and writers use racial stereotypes to make a more complex story with more suspects."
"Conversely, many people believe that horror is bad, as it is believed to cause anxiety and nightmares. This may be because of the fear it can cause in sensitive people. While this may be true for those few, participants in a study conducted by researchers \u201creported a significant uptick in positive moods after experiencing the haunted attraction.\u201d(the Conversation, \u201cHow Do Horror Movies Affect Your Brain? Here\u2019s What Loving Or Hating them Says About Your Personality, According To Experts\u201d p4). Fear can have some positive effects, as the participants were happier after confronting their fears. Therefore, while fear can indeed have negative effects for a select few, for he most part it can have a more positive effects, which are not simply it being \u2018thrilling\u2019 and \u2018fun\u2019."
"People from higher classes play a wide range of sport and often go swimming, to the gym or play tennis which means they get more exercise than people from working class families who tend to spend more time sitting around the house. Working class adults tend to have extremely manual jobs, which eventually has adverse affects on the body, causing them to die at an earlier age than those in office jobs."
"They are also resourceful, child-like, and kind. The BFG is the only giant in his homeland who does not eat humans because he thinks that would be inhumane. He would rather eat disgusting vegetables than take another life. He also is resourceful in that he uses his job as dream catcher to enlist the help of an authority figure, the Queen of England, to stop the evil giants from eating children. His child-like personality is seen in his gentleness with Sophie and in his fear that she would tell on him."
"The fact that this aspect of the law is based on the Fourth Amendment makes it impossible to extend its application, on the model of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, to private actors. There have been many court decisions invoking these rules. The tort of interference with private life, which confers a right to take legal action against private and public actors, has been recognized in law for more than a century, and today in almost every state. Four different legal actions are generally admitted allowing to dispute the unreasonable interference in the privacy of a person, the appropriation of the name or image of others, the public representation of a person in a misleading and unreasonable publicity given to the privacy of a person."
"Many think abortions are helpful if you don\u2019t want or can\u2019t handle a baby, but what they don\u2019t know it the damage it can cause. Did you know that at just five weeks the baby\u2019s heart is already beating? In the United States, you can get an abortion up to 24 weeks."
"The help uses many rhetorical devices, but known more than colloquial language. Kathryn Stockett makes sure that each one of her characters sounds real. The reader doesn\u2019t have to infer what it sounds like because it is written that way. Stockett\u2019s use of colloquial language is continuous throughout the novel and varies as the characters change, for every few characters have distinct dialects or accents."
"During this visit, Nel walked in on Sula and Jude \u201cdown on all fours naked\u201d with nothing touching \u201cexcept their lips right down there on the floor\u201d. Sula had sexual intercourse with her own best friend\u2019s husband. Morally is it right not to sleep with someone else husband but Sula was only thinking about pleasuring herself at the moment and not the value of friendship her a Sula have. Only focusing on one\u2019s else can cause a person to be disloyal to people that are close to them. Jude is a man that isn\u2019t judged as much as the betrayal between Sula and Nel because men have more power so actions they take doesn\u2019t really affect them. Betrayal leads to the death of friendship because of sexual intercourse."
"Jacki was the youngest of five in his family. In 1920, after his father abandoned the family they moved to Pasadena California, to live with his uncle. You could say the Jackie\u2019s childhood was a wild one. He wasn\u2019t a rich kid, so he had to work when he was a little kid so he could help his family. Selling newspapers and vending hot dogs at the Rose Bowl stadium were both normal trades of Jackie making a dollar here and there."
"However, a new focus has emerged. One of the biggest culprits is stress. Studies show that constant exposure to racism creates a level of stress that which makes African Americans vulnerable to health problems such as heart disease, and hypertension. According to an early study by Sherman James of Duke University, people who cope with overwhelming stress on a regular basis by exerting \u201cprodigious physical and mental effort\u201d open themselves up to potentially devastating health issues. James\u2019 study suggests that specifically blacks pay a physical price, with higher rates of blood pressure and hypertension (James, 1994). James began his research in the early 1980s which shows that this issue has been constantly building over time."
"Through my freshman and junior year, I was forced to take care of a baby, while my dad drank, and his girlfriend got high. Also, I lost both of my grandparents in two years. This was so hard because my grandparents raised me and gave me stability when my parents could not. Finally, in the second half of my junior year I had a complete mental breakdown, affecting me physically. I was not able to go to school for the last month, I lost fifteen pounds because I could not eat, and I slept a lot."
"The extended family could also be on the increase in Britain now due to us having a more diverse ethnic background, with Asian families in particular valuing the extended family. It can also be seen that more people are choosing to be single than ever before, again I can bring the issue of ethnicity into this as it is widely reported that a lot of Afro-Caribbean families are single parent families, where as this was once seen to be something that society would question, it would now appear that society has become more accepting of individuals who would like to live alone, and put such things as career or education before a relationship."
"Wong and Lam\u2019s case was an example to reflect the issue on how\u2019s Government support to this group of people. According to the Census and Statistics Department in Hong Kong, there are around 300, 000 persons in families of elderly doubletons and they didn\u2019t get enough support from the Government. Hong Kong Government tries to promote ageing in place which wants to encourage the elders to live in the community, but it didn\u2019t have adequate medical and financial support for the elderly which help them to have a proper care. When the elders\u2019 health condition was getting worse and their economic class is low, they may not get better medical treatment for them. At the same time, they may need to wait for a long time to move in the residential care homes or living in private homes for the elderly which provide variable quality of care."
"It hopefully also gave the viewers the urge to change their ways in order to fight the bigger crisis that may come in the future because of global warming. Like Gore said, \u201cThis is not really a political issue, so much as it is a moral issue, if we allow global warming to happen it is deeply unethical.\u201dAuthority also plays a role in the documentary. Gore, for instance, is a great example of authority on the topic of global warming. He has a great knowledge on the subject from his constant research and is looked up to by many people because of his standing on politics, since he is a well known political figure."
"This reference to \u2018the lusty moor\u2019 could be Iago\u2019s racism which causes him to suspect Othello, or it could be his suspicions that cause him to be racist, but nevertheless, to a certain extent due to Othello\u2019s heritage, Iago\u2019s hatred of him quickly falls to racism. It is stressed from the beginning that Iago is a traitorous man during Iago\u2018s monologue in the opening scene; \u2018I follow him to serve my turn upon him\u2019 (A1, S1, L42) \u2018I am not what I am\u2019 (A1, S1, L66) Iago has made his intentions clear from the very beginning, which leads the audience to believe that he has a plan to destroy Othello\u2019s life, which is elevant to the fall of a tragic hero, as the destruction is apparently inevitable. Rank is relevant to the representation of a tragic hero, because according to Aristotle, the tragic hero is usually from a noble or royal family and has a high status in society. Rank is also relevant because the whole concept of rank and worthiness sparks jealousy in Iago, he is jealous of Cassio\u2019s promotion and also Othello\u2019s general status. Iago\u2019s jealousy of Cassio is apparent in the first scene; \u2018\u2026mere prattle without practice is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election,"
"Alternately, if adopted children are more similar to adopted parents, this provides a strong case for environmental influences. Studies have shown that criminal biological parents lead to a high frequency of criminal offspring (more so when both parents are criminals). Bohman, Clongier, Sigvardsson & Knornig (1982) investigated the relationship between environment and genetic factors using cross fostering analysis of petty crime. The result showed, when both factors were present criminality was 40% compared to 12% for genetic factors alone and 6.7% for environmental alone."
"In addition to this, America at the time of James still sees a society wherein being a colored means being a lesser human being; where black power is being fought for, and being black while having a white mother makes you trapped in questions and confused. This is followed by a recollection in the home of her mother in Suffolk, Virginia, where the absence of opportunities for blacks and Jews alike has lead them to miserable poverty, in addition to the presence of the Klu Klux Klan which presents constant intimidation and violence for them (McBride, n. ag. ). This recollection is then intertwined with the experiences of James with respect to his siblings, highlighting the difficulties of raising a family that explores his/her racial identities (McBride, n. pag. ). The next chapters, especially School, Boys and Daddy explores the personal experiences of both James and Ruth on racial prejudice, with Ruth having to secretly meet with her loved one due to the threat of the Ku Klux Klan, and the fears of James in attending a predominantly white school."
"America\u2019s Promise Ministries is an anti-Semitic religion that hides behind Christianity. This organization is in a position to create the perfect storm. They are a church that feeds their interpretation of what God\u2019s intent for humankind is and able to distribute right-wing racist material anywhere in the world. Is it wrong to want one Nation under God and be with your kind? Oh, wait! That\u2019s America and what the founding fathers believed built this country with just that same thought in mind."
"Penelope is Junior\u2019s girlfriend that he meets at Reardan. They first meet on his first day of school and she makes fun of him. He then develops a crush on her and admirers her from afar. There second meeting was when he finds her coming out of the bathroom after she vomits. They then from a boyfriend/ girlfriend relationship after the incident, initially he believes that she is only dating him to spite her father (Alexie 2007)."
"Essentially, this method gives the commander freedom of planning, making decisions and designing future education programs for the force (p.33). Additionally, the NCO support channel helps the chain of command in designing and carrying out every day unit activities. Moreover, they train army soldiers in conducting unit operations as well as individual task. It is the responsibility of NCO support channel to ensure the wellbeing of soldiers and their family members during their working time and when they are out of work. Non-commissioned officer and the other Officers work together and complement each other as a unit. However, research conducted by Army Research Institute revealed that there has been problem between officers and Non-commission officers (Reimer, 2003, p.2). NCO and Officers have conflicts over the sharing of their duties, it is said that some Officers perform all the duties leaving NCO with nothing to do."
"264). The structure of this group is to increase the feeling of self-worth for the individuals that are participating. This is also helpful in different cultures. The pattern identified with this type of group is that it can be applied and is being used in many different settings such as; hospitals, mental health agencies, correctional institutions, social service and all of this is outside of the traditional educational setting. This provides hope for me personally since I\u2019m interested in my degree to be in a hospital and or correctional institutional setting."
"I believed that harmony family is the key of happiness and peaceful in our life. We have to know that money cannot buy happiness, love and everything that we wish for. As a parents, we should show a noble attitude as a role model to children. Parents are the nearest people and teachers to children. Hence, children will follow our actions mostly and assume us as their model. If we do like this, I am very sure that the social problems can be reduced and we can live peacefully."
"Modern Zoo\u2019s have more functions than just displaying animals to entertain people. People have always associated zoo\u2019s with collecting and caging of wild animals. The first modern zoo was opened on 1793 in Paris, France and this changed the common people\u2019s perception of zoo. It was at this time that several zoologists wanted to study and research about animals and that gave zoo\u2019s a different purpose. Following are some of the functions of zoo\u2019s other than public entertainment."
"The situation worsens when she also threatens and reminds Crooks of his status as a Negro, removing Crooks\u2019 pride and dignity, when he dares to demand her to leave his room. \u201cListen, Nigger, You know what I can do to you if you open your trap? \u201d This then causes the reader to recognize both the lonesome and malevolent side of her. She also mocks and puts people down when it comes to the dreams of other people. \u201cI seen too many of you guys. \u201d Dreams are a major reoccurring theme in the novel \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d. When Lennie tells Curley\u2019s wife of his and George\u2019s dream, she mocks them saying its \u201cBaloney\u201d."
"The instance is an American playwright Tennessee Williams, play A Streetcar Named Desire; in the zone of Elysian fields, New Orleans, where Elysian fields refer to a place where the life is purely known as it is. Pure from classism and worries. Where the character Blanche, just gone by a road through two streetcars named Cemeteries and Desire incoming at Elysian Fields.In accordance with the relevance of the context. She went through a route of life (Desire), preceding death (Cemeteries), to heaven ( Elysian fields )."
"are also used to give the same effect of war. Heaney uses the word rank as a pun. It has two different meanings, smelly and rotten or a rank in the army. Both are images that Heaney includes in his poem frequently. This pun shows us to different aspects if the world Heaney grew up in. They both are linked with danger, the unclean area, which he grew up in, and the war that surrounded his everyday life. The ninth line in the last stanza is an example of a simile to create a strong war image,"
"We know that even if it\u2019s not about race, it\u2019s always about race. You can say that the student protests were all about race. When you ask people about which \u201crace\u201d they are, one normally gets a response like, asian, black, white, or so on. The two schools of thought, Primordialism and Instrumentalism, are opposing forces in which the former believes that \u201craces existed, that races are biologically determined and distinct from one another. \u201d The latter believes \u201crace as a man-made, human created reality. It is an instrument that was constructed sociohistorically in order to allocate resources\u201d."
"The depth of Darcy and Elizabeth\u2019s bond will lead them to a peaceful and lasting marriage. Another factor in the couple\u2019s happiness is the uncommon compatibility that exists between the two. Elizabeth said it best when she describes Darcy as \u201c\u201dthe man who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her\u201d(264). Their charismatic similarities are vast. Both Elizabeth and Darcy are bold, confident, and remain independent of society\u2019s expectations. The chemistry between them intensifies with every encounter in the story. Read what to do f you find a path with no obstacles"
"If the child comes from a difficult background then it is going to affect development for example if the child is in a poor or less privileged family then it will affect their development as the house may not be very well maintained as they cannot afford it. The child may get cold at night as there is no heating and as a result become sick and they will not be able to attend school therefore they are missing out on an education which means they cannot get out of the cycle of poverty."
"Not taking into consideration that human beings are the ones that control objects, such as guns, not the other way around. If that were the case, why not ban all sorts of weapons; anything could be a weapon. From a paper clip to a car, all could be used as an object to harm others. In any case, completely ignoring the 2nd amendment and banning guns would create uproar with many pro-gun citizens. Though some gun control is a good thing, such as background checks and at least 21 of age to purchase a gun, there should not be any reason to put anymore laws into effect."
"We all think that immigration nowadays is bad, but have you thought about what happened in the past and how many immigrants have came here. The Romans invaded in the 43-410AD. There were about 1-2 million people. Then the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, all invaded in 400-600AD. I will explain the good and the bad for immigration, why its good for some people and not for others."
"In the child marriage, one of the effect in most marriages is it doesn\u2019t always last, they do end in divorce. Some of the most leading causes in divorce are lack of foundation and lack of communication. Why would you want to get married to someone that you have nothing in common with but in this case most of the early age marriages are that arranging by the family that\u2019s why most of them they don\u2019t know each other so that they can\u2019t share information they don\u2019t have enough communication and may the girl doesn\u2019t have life experience, or beliefs. When they enter into marriage, can\u2019t sharing some of the same interest and passions can be important. If it is a marriage expected last if the couple doesn\u2019t know each other and share any experience, beliefs, passions, values, or expectations so that cause they will separate. Just what would the foundation of their marital relationship? Another common cause of divorce is lack of communication. Lots of couples lack communication when it comes to making decisions. When couples are able to talk, they are most likely to solve their problems. Disagreements due to lack of communication can often lead to arguments. Not being able to communicate can also cause financial problems and finally divorce."
"Friendship always played an important role for people It is obvious because people are social beings and they need to communicate. However we all think differently and it is significant how people distinguish friendship from other relationships. A question arises : what can friendship mean? What does it mean for me in particularly?"
"According to Dr. Perry (2017, p.79) PTSD is an over aroused state where individuals can act on impulse, or aggression that is out of their own control when triggered. PTSD individuals tend to respond similarly to how they did during the traumatic incident. If the individual went into a dissociated state during the traumatic incident, they will often go back into this state when triggered. Dr. Perry (2017, p52) also states symptoms exhibited in a disassociated state are daydreaming, hyperarousal, aggression, impulsivity, defiance and/or opposition. Based on Dr. Perry\u2019s PTSD definitions, questions were produced focusing on PTSD symptoms as well as the correlation to disassociation. Marie was to answer if she has ever experienced daydreaming, or difficulties sleeping, and if she had any flashbacks and/or dreams pertaining to her childhood particularly relating to her relationship with her mother."
"Management development programs are another significant component of the learning options available which gives Marriott a strong record of promoting internally (Marriott International, 2009). Marriott works hard to build an internal pipeline of talent, helping associates develop the knowledge and skills they need to progress within the company (Marriott International, 2009). Annually, Marriott conduct career development discussions with their associates to further understand career aspirations, and provide development plans to support future growth."
"To summarize, the main point of the argument for the death penalty is that crime will go down because of the fear of punishment. This is the belief of those that advocate the death penalty for all violent crimes, and all of the information to the contrary does not appear to change this opinion."
"My target market will be people aged over 16 and the principal short-term objective of the business is to obtain a market. The attraction of a business of this group I feel will be essential in the first year to break even. After these first goals have been achieved new targets will be set for the advancement of the business."
"I have seen media portrayal of Asian Americans and all of the stereotypes that go along with them. In my lifetime I have heard everything from all Asians eat rice to all Asians know karate, kung Fu and can\u2019t drive well. These are all just stereotypes and have absolutely no merit at all. However it has been somewhat difficult for me as a student and researcher until now to disprove these myths personally. Limited interactions with members of the Asian community due to a lack of opportunistic access have made in-depth research into behavioral patterns extremely difficult if not completely impossible. This assignment has allowed me to step into a world that has helped me to distinguish between two fascinatingly different cultures from my own. I look forward to working with members of the Chinese and Korean communities in the future as clients and professionals alike."
"This allowed Gibson and Walk to investigate whether any of the animals would be calm, and be able to move on the deep side if they realised it was safe. The use of animals gave insight into perception further as they were able to compare the reactions of animals that are more visual (such as cats, which rely on vision greatly to hunt) and animals that rely more on other senses (such as rats, which are mainly nocturnal and rely more on tactical cues from their vibrissae."
"The visual argument was prominent throughout Al Gore\u2019s documentary. When he was not using the many pictures and videos consuming mostly of the drastic changes that are already taking place, he was showing the graphs of scientific study and predictions for the near future all because of global warming. The pictures contained mountains that were once covered with snow caps but are now dry and desolate, glaciers that once stood 700 feet tall but now crack and crumble only to melt in the infrared warmed waters, lakes that once flowed freely down their lively paths but now almost cease to exist, and even trees that were once colorful and forcefully standing but now weak and drained of pigment. These were strong visual arguments as much as they were emotional stimuli. Strong arguments because the pictures spoke for themselves and no one can argue against the facts they can see with their own two eyes and strong emotional stimuli because people could now see\u00a0what their children will never or no longer be able to see or enjoy. Another example of visual argument that provokes emotional responses would be the weather changes."
"The DNA is what causes these primates and humans to be similar. According to the article on AMNH, \u201cHuman and chimp DNA is nearly identical when you compare the bands on chromosomes, the bundles of DNA inside nearly every cell\u201d (para 3). Later on the article explains that, \u201cHuman and chimp X chromosomes both contain about 1,100 different genes, or sets of instructions. Each gene affects a particular trait in the body\u201d (AMNH, para 3). With humans and the primates being so 98.8 percent similar, these instructions are relatively the same. The only difference between the DNA of that of a chimp and that of a human is the size of the strands in the chromosome of the two. That size of the chromosome strand means the difference between being human and an ape. When it comes to studying the brain, primates are the best option. According to an article on greenfacts.org, \u201c non-human primates (NHPs) and humans have very similar brains, experiments on primates remain crucial. At present, primates are the only animals available to study how the activity of a single nerve cell is related to more complicated brain functions\u201d (para 20). Chimpanzees and orangutans are help researchers with studies of how the body and mind work because of the immense similarities between them. In an article by ncbi.org, there is a quotes that is very important regarding the brain. The article by ncbi states that, \u201cwhile rodents are used extensively and are extremely helpful in answering many basic research questions, their usefulness is limited by differences from primates in their lack of sophisticated brain structures, less developed immune systems and motor skills, and differences in how their metabolism functions, among other traits\u201d (ncbi.org, para 8)."
"Mexico\u2019s relationship to the United States has a long history. In 1835 Texas, then Mexican territory, declared its independence and ten years later was annexed to the United States. After that came the U.S.-Mexican War. When it was over, the U.S. had acquired half the land that once belonged to Mexico, including all or parts of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming."
"From the findings it was revealed that parents were not so much involved in school activities that they were not attending meetings, collect students reports, they cannot solve disciplinary cases like truancy and dropout and cannot even contribute to renovate the school and hence causing poor performance. However, this made the interpersonal relationship among teachers and parents to be low. The researcher also revealed that organizing parents meeting has both positive and negative impact to the school."
"Long term planning is where it sets up opportunities for the whole year this may include setting up the learning environment indoor and outdoor, organising areas of provision deciding on core equipment, decisions about regular routines and devising a strategy to ensure coverage of the seven areas of learning and development."
"They also need age appropriate therapeutic services from mental health professionals who have been trained to deal with violent victimization and traumatized children. Not all children who are exposed to violence develop these symptoms. If they have the right support systems they can overcome these obstacles. Grief is a response to knowledge, what we know has to change, awareness. It is a word used to describe he emotions, cognitive, behavioral, and physical reactions that one experiences following the death ofa loved one."
"Crooks character has a need for companionship due to his loneliness. Page 73 of chapter 4 sees Crooks explaining to Lennie \u201cIf some guy was with me, he could tell me I was asleep, an\u2018 then it would be all right.\u201d Crooks is trying to emphasize the fact he has no reassurance when he has bad dreams or pessimistic thoughts. This shows Crooks\u2019 character dwelling on how alone he is without anyone to talk to or interact with."
"The book then shifts on how Ruth has found her guidance and inspiration amidst all these contradictions, tracing her Orthodox Jewish origins to her eventual conversion to Christianity (McBride, n. pag. ). Her early experiences are never easy. Contrary to the popular belief that having a new life in America will lead you to the prosperous \u201cAmerican Dream,\u201d In the chapter entitled the \u201cOld Testament,\u201d the experiences of Ruth\u2019s family were no American dream; on the contrary, they suffered under constant poverty (McBride, n. pag. )."
"Managing diversity entails recognition of the unique contribution every employee can make.5 Managing diversity also moves beyond valuing diversity in that it is a way in which to do business and should be aligned with other organizational strategic plans.6 Diverse employees offer an extraordinarily wide range of proficiencies for doing business in any marketplace. The following are different approaches that Wilkens and Richards could have taken to be more effective in their efforts (see footnote 8):"
"* From 1973 to 2000, more that 39 million legal abortions occurred * By legalizing abortion, the largest decline in birth rate were seen among women over 35 years, teenagers, and unmarried women (Levine, et. el,1999) * Today 30% of abortions are done on women over 35 years. * If legal abortions were not available, more women would experience of unwanted child bearing, which will affect the entire family. Their emotional and psychological life will be affected. * Couples become willing to conceive without fear of genetic disorders. In such an even, they can avail the process of safe legal abortion. * Most women report a sense of relief after the abortion, although a few would report depression."
"My survey will have to be carried out at separate times for males and females so they wont see their partners views on division of labour therefore any conflict between partners will be avoided. Separate interviewing of partners will allow better answers that have not been pressured by the other partner. I feel that implementing my survey in this way allows for the best results to be established."
"Compared to their whit\u00e5 count\u00e5rparts, dating violence was more prevalent among middle class African American teens. About 1/4 of Black undergraduates reported that while being in a dating relationship, th\u00e5y experienced physical violence. The most common forms of physical violence were pushing, slapping, hitting, and choking (Pi\u00e5rce-Bak\u00e5r, 1998). African Americans coupl\u00e5s who are divorced and seeking marriage licenses both indicated that they experienced dating violence while being in a romantic relationship. Studi\u00e5s hav\u00e5 shown significant rates of sexual violence against black teens, however, the victims of this form of violence were likely to be black women (Pi\u00e5rce-Bak\u00e5r, 1998). Between 34% and 50% African Americans female college students revealed that they were pressured to have sex by their partners."
"Beyond that, the number of minority ethnic candidates in Birmingham was increasing towards the end of the twentieth century (Garbaye, 2002) as efforts had been made by the Conservative Party and Liberal Democrats to support minority ethnic candidates to gain a substantial share of the vote. However, Dr Fieldhouse, in his study of minority ethnic politics in Birmingham, stated that \u2018political parties that exclusively represented minority ethnic groups have had a little electoral impact\u2019. The attempts to involve minority ethnic groups in specific advisory and consultative bodies were unsuccessful as they were more likely to participate in interest groups focusing on specific community issues. Over the years, many large ethnic minority organizations had become actively associated with Birmingham City Council\u2019s urban regeneration programmes (Council, 2019). Hence, much bigger migrants\u2019 participation is to be found at the local grassroots level as compared to the mainstream national level."
"The world of math today is one with endless possibilities. It expands into several and interesting subjects, typically being included into our everyday lives. Today, I will discuss one of these topics; the most astonishing and fascinating formula invented, called the \u201cEuler\u2019s formula\u201d. This formula was created and presented by mathematician Leonhard Euler. In essence, the formula develops the deep relationship in between trigonometric functions and the complex rapid function."
"Robert E. Worden wrote, \u201cThe \u2018Causes\u2019 of Police Brutality: Theory and Evidence on Police Use of Force\u201d to explore the variety of reasons that drive police brutality. One of Worden\u2019s main claims is that non-white suspects are more likely to experience an arrest. Based on his sociological theory, \u201cPolice behavior is influenced by social dynamics of police-citizen encounters\u201d (Worden 150). This study established that non-white suspects were more likely to be arrested. After taking an in depth look at police reports, black suspects were reported to be more disrespectful than any other demographic. The statistics also confirmed that minorities are overrepresented among police shooting victims."
"There are two cases of police brutality that has gone on today and both have not been resolved yet. There is a lot of controversy about police brutality in the United States. In these two cases presented, there will be similarities between them and how both police departments handled the situation. There has been two cases that have to do with police shootings. The Walter Scott case is about Officer Michael Slager who was responsible for the shooting of Walter Scott."
"This does not sway their parents though, who firmly state that their children will be taking the test no matter what. Some of these reasons are fair for wanting their child to take the test despite its flaws. Immigrant parents say that they took tests all the time and their children should learn to do so too. Other parents are resigned to the fact that it will help along their college admissions."
"Although his family was very strict, they taught him that getting a good education should be his top priority as it would prepare him for the life ahead. True enough, my father applied this lesson in his life as he graduated from high school as one of the top students in his class. However, since his family was poor he was unable to attend college immediately. Instead, he worked as a clerk for two years and helped provide for his family, while also attending a community college on a part-time basis to gain some academic credits."
"One manifestation of the lesson learned by Jason is how he spent his $1,500 earnings. Not only did Jason was able to work for his money but he also discovered the gift of sharing it wisely with people who are in need (Stovall 44-46). This part showed how Jason got the ultimate gift which represented a moral motivation as well as a significant manner to relay core values, principles and memorable life events which are definitely needed by people."
"It is the result of continuous interaction with our surroundings. People in our lives such as friends, family, teachers, idols and classmates affect the way we identify ourselves. They are a big factor in building up our identity. In many cases, some people\u2019s identity has been shaken due to poor body image and physical appearance and this has contributed significantly to one\u2019s identity."
"2001 I had my fourth child that wasn\u2019t planned man with this pregnancy boy did I eat I had a huge belly people thought I was having twins, but I wasn\u2019t there was just one baby in my belly. I remember when I was having her it was hilarious; I was due for April 11th instead I had her for my birthday that was the greatest gift. The night before I gave birth to one of my princess I was on the computer talking with my nephew, my husband was at work my kids were playing around and everything was pretty much normal as I\u2019m talking with my nephew and joking all of the sudden my water bag broke so I told my nephew, he was like what titi and I repeated myself and told him this never happened so I let him go and called my doctor she told me Mrs. Torres I would need you to come in I told her the soonest I can be In is when my husband gets here from work she replied I see you soon. My husband got home after midnight as soon as he came in I looked at him and told him it\u2019s time my water broke we got the kids ready and off we went to the hospital so when I got there they put me on the baby monitor were monitoring my contractions after had me walking around while my husband and my children were in the waiting room finally at 5 something in the morning she decided enter the world I couldn\u2019t believe another little girl she was beautiful she looked like a little witch with them long fingers but beautiful after she was cleaned up and myself they allowed my family to come in and between my family and the nurses sung us happy birthday with my favorite cake coconut yummy. When we were let out the hospital, we moved to Pennsylvania do to my husband getting another job, but it didn\u2019t last long so he found something different and moved upstate New York. I stood in Pennsylvania for a while."
"A current advocate for Mexican Americans is Eva Longoria. Though not as well known as Rosa Parks, Longoria is doing much work for Hispanic Americans. Eva Jacqueline Longoria Bast\u00f3n is an American Actress who does non profit work for an organization called the Eva Longoria Foundation. Eva was born on March 15, 1975 in Corpus Christi, Texas. She was born to Mexican American parents. She actually did not learn the Spanish language until 2009. Longoria has acted in many movies, but she has done much more towards correcting the education gap plaguing Latinas. Eva Longoria created Eva\u2019s Heroes in 2006 which helps developmentally disabled children. Her most successful organization, the Eva Longoria Foundation, helps provide Latinos with a chance at high school and college. Longoria was name Philanthropist of the year in 2009. She also was a huge supporter of Barack Obama, and helped him to carry votes by creating the Latino Victory Project. Eva is currently very interested in immigration. She has immersed herself in the issue of immigration and has deemed Arizona\u2019s SB 1070 immigration law as unconstitutional. The law was quote \u201cOn April 23, 2010, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed into law Senate Bill 1070 aimed at preventing illegal immigration that has significantly affected the Mexico-bordering state over many decades. The law, entitled Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, would require law enforcement officials to enforce existing federal immigration laws in the state by checking the immigration status of a person they have \u2018reasonable suspicion\u2019 of being in the U.S. illegally. But a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2012 and a settlement with plaintiffs in 2016 have collectively gutted the law.\u201d Longoria is one of many current fighters for the equality of minority races."
"It is only when the stress becomes too great, affecting our physical or mental functioning, that it becomes a problem. The stress response of the body is meant to protect and support us. To maintain stability or homeostasis, the body is constantly adjusting to its surroundings. When a physical or mental event threatens this equilibrium, we react to it. This process is often referred to as the \u201cfight or flight response. \u201d We prepare for physical action in order to confront or flee a threat. When it is part of a natural reaction to challenge or danger, the body\u2019s response is called positive stress."
"It is important that we teach children that it doesn\u2019t matter where you come from, what beliefs/views you have, what language you speak or what you look like, everyone is equal and deserves the same opportunities as anyone else \u2013 by doing this we encourage children to value everyone which in turn will help them have an open mind and be able tolerate differences more easily. It is also important to value and promote cultural diversity because it can help to prevent stereotyping, prejudice, discrimination and also reduce the risks od tokenism (where you only acknowledge different cultures/religions through posters or at certain times of the year)."
"Both stories explore hypocrisy. In Walker\u2019s \u201cThe Welcome Table\u201d even the title is ironic because the African-American woman who wanders absent-mindedly into a white church finds no welcome, but embarrassed shock-there is no welcome table for her in God\u2019s house, because white and black people have their own churches. The welcome table itself is an interesting image: it is at once a reference to the table of the Last Supper, symbolized in Christianity by the alter where communion is celebrated and where Christians go to eat brad and drink wine, but it is also in heaven- the bountiful table that the old lady believes awaits her after death. In the white church which she enters and then is ejected from, there is no welcome table, despite the Christian teaching of love and forgiveness for all. As Klinkowitz ( 2001, 146) puts it, \u201cIf you are Christian, and a sincere one, do you think Jesus was present in that hypocritical white church? Or is he out there on the road with the old dying lady? In Gordimer\u2019s Country Lovers\u201d the hypocrisy is more personal, despite having the support of the legal system and the apparatus of the apartheid system. As a young boy growing up Paulus simply follow his natural feelings by being attracted to Thebedi. There is a beautiful innocence and a tantalizing sensuousness to the description of his physical desire for her, but as he gets older and becomes more conventional, more socialized he is happy to betray her and ultimately to kill the child they have produced to save himself from prosecution under the Immortality Act. Therefore, his hypocrisy is personal and vindictive and selfish, whereas the hypocrisy in \u201cThe Welcome Table\u201d is more generalized and based on centuries of slavery and the oppression of African-Americans in the United States."
"On November 21, I received a negative counseling for disrespecting a Non Commissioned Officer, though it was warranted by a series of events I didn\u2019t agree with I should have found a more appropriate way to voice my concerns. The online dictionary defines disrespect as an expression of lack of respect and a fashion that is generally disrespectful and contemptuous. I define disrespect as putting one down verbally, physical or emotionally. In this essay I will be talking about the research I did on article 88 and 91 of the uniformed code of military justice."
"Our society has become desensitized to, has normalized and even romanticized the dynamics of abuse among intimate partners. Even in more progressive areas where rigid gender roles and underlying historical aspects of inequality appear to have diminished, I\u2019m not convinced this is the case. Intimate partner violence remains prevalent in our popular culture, which is a huge influence on today\u2019s youth."
"Upon the divorce of their parents, children experience a wide range of emotional reactions, including sadness, anger, loneliness, depression which frequently lasts into later phases of life, heightened anxiety, worry, lower life satisfaction, lower self-esteem and self-confidence, fear, yearning, rejection, conflicting loyalties, and a sense of fault for their parents\u2019 problems (Mental Health). An analysis by David Popenoe of the National Survey of Children found that divorce was associated with a higher incidence of several mental health problems in children: depression; withdrawal from friends and family; aggressive, impulsive, or hyperactive behavior; and either behaving disruptively or withdrawing from participation in the classroom. Parental divorce may also contribute to the development of mood disorders, bipolar I disorder, dysthymia (mild chronic depression), depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Divorce is related to increased depression and anxiety for both boys and girls of all ages. However, boys find parental divorce more emotionally disturbing than girls do, and boys with divorced parents tended to be more depressed than those from two-parent families regardless of the psychological adjustment, level of conflict, or quality of parenting manifested by their parents. Psychological problems are less severe for those whose pre-divorce families were high-conflict families. According to Paul Amato of the Department of Sociology at Pennsylvania State University, child and adult well-being may actually improve after the end of an extremely conflicted marriage."
"Othello is therefore not only presented as an outsider, but as someone who is demonic, which at the time the play was written and performed, was a very serious accusation. Characters within the play, very easily express their discriminatory opinions on Othello, as they successfully aim to single him out, allowing an audience to view him as an outsider. Through the racial slur \u2018Moor\u2019, used to describe Othello multiple times, one could suggest that he is an outsider not only to those whom he lives with, but feasibly within society."
"All professional settings are governed by policies to some degree; this may be internal written covenants or governing legal bodies that set national standards. Health and social care setting is no different and has many stringent regulations and standards in order ensure good practice. Some examples would include: Care Standards Act 2000: An Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which provides for the management of a variety of care organizations, Including children\u2019s, nursing and residential care homes."
"To contrast this case, Foot then presents a second case of abortion called a craniotomy, whereby the fetus\u2019s skull must be crushed in order to save its mother\u2019s life during labor. In this case, Foot points out that the DDE would not condone this procedure and that the permissible course of action would be to allow the mother to die. This is because; in not performing the procedure we foresee the mother\u2019s death but in no way intend or desire it, whereas directly crushing the fetus\u2019s skull would be considered an intentional cause of its death. Similarly, the DDA would also classify craniotomy as impermissible as crushing the fetus\u2019s skull would be considered a direct action of killing rather than allowing death to occur."
"Mira still lives in Detroit, works in the Southfield, Mich. , school system, and has become 4 nationally recognized for her contributions in the fields of pre-school education and parent-teacher relationships. After 36 years as a legal immigrant in this country, she clings passionately to her Indian citizenship and hopes to go home to India when she retires. In Iowa City in 1963, I married a fellow student, an American of Canadian parentage. Because 5 of the accident of his North Dakota birth, I bypassed labor-certification requirements and the race-related \u201cquota\u201d system that favored the applicant\u2019s country of origin over his or her merit."
"Possibly, cases which were undiagnosed in previous decades are now being diagnosed because of greater awareness of this condition; it has also been proposed that the condition is now being overdiagnosed in individuals whose behaviors are readily suggestible (American Psychiatric Association, 94). It is probably safe to conclude that the prevalence of Dissociative Identity Disorder is in dispute at this time; some may also dispute the validity of this diagnosis as the DSM-IV, unlike earlier versions of the DSM, does not provide any diagnostic reliability information (American Psychiatric Association, 99). Diagnosis"
"James Baldwin turns to every person with a message that it is the personal responsibility of everyone considering oneself an educated person to change the society. Everything starts with the mentality of people and their level of perception of the external world, its rules and beliefs. Is we are not sheep following the shepherd, we have to think globally and turn off the stereotypes created by people with a limited worldview. By uncovering the ugly truth, he tries to change the minds of readers and influence the situation that needs urgent change."
"In the Jamestown colony of Virginia in 1608, Captain George Kendall was sentenced to be hanged for the capital offense of treason. Among other serious capital crimes in colonial times were murder, rape \u2013 and witchcraft. Then later the first state to limit crimes punishable with the death penalty was Pennsylvania. In 1682 the conference of Pennsylvania produced the Great Law or Body of Laws, which consisted of 61 chapters dictating the governance of Pennsylvania. It included the original Quaker criminal code which limited crimes punishable by death to premeditated murder and treason."
"Gunns has effectively addressed the sociocultural myopia that was damaging the reputation and performance of the company by engaging more openly with the community. This management of the demographic changes the company has undergone has the potential to give the company a strategic advantage (Strack et. al 2008). The company must be careful, however, to not allow future sociocultural forces that are not commercially viable influence the company to the extent that any competitive advantage is lost. The current situation and the addressing of the problem by Gunns exhibits a positive management of this element of the PEST environment, though there is uncertainty in the future. As such, the outlook for this element of the business environment can only be deemed as neutral."
"They want to \u201clive off the fat of the land\u201d, suggesting that they don\u2019t want to work for anyone and be continuingly undermined by bosses and having to live in such awful conditions. They don\u2019t want to be one of the stereotypes as they say \u201cus guys are the loneliest guys in the world\u201d. To conclude, I think that Steinbeck presents Lennie and George with a strong relationship. George being a father like figure to Lennie. They both need each other, otherwise they would be lonely just like other itinerant workers at this time. Lennie really does look up to George and there has been a strong sense of foreboding through the actions from the past that we find out about. As the book progresses I can expect the reader to understand more fully that the relationship that these two men have."
"In 1876, the Indian Act had encouraged the gradual disappearance of Indians as Indians and promoted their assimilation into Canadian society. This act had made all Indians \u201cwards of the state\u201d and left them with little control of their own affairs. The 1920s was the time that this act was really applied. The Indian Act had been created earlier, but the Canadian government never seriously implemented it to get rid of the Aboriginal culture once and for all until the 1920s."
"The exclusion of Candy is another indication of the inequalities in American society in that it was very ageist and discriminative. In our society pensioners are treated with a lot more respect that the average middle-aged working class citizen but we learn from this novel that society in 1920 was juxtaposed to this. Candy did not get pension or benefits for the government; the only sum of money he received was the inadequate sum of $250 for the loss of his hand, which contributed massively to his uslessness. This is an indication in of an inequality in society as old people were not even valued by the government as there were no pensions."
"In 1989, the supreme court case Webster v. Reproductive Health Services imposed on the use of state funds, facilities, and employees in performing and assisting with the counselling on abortions. Then later, in 1992, the supreme court case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey ruled the loosening of standards for restrictions on abortion. Women were given more choice and freedom over whether or not they wanted to terminate their pregnancy."
"Criteria that are used to classify an inmate\u2019s risk include the severity of the charge, existing warrants, sentencing status, criminal/escape history, institutional disciplinary history, age, employment, residence, substance abuse, and family relations. Needs that are assessed fall under four different areas including medical condition, mental condition, intellectual capacity, and substance abuse."
"The first step in structuring this is setting aside topics for compare and contrast essays. This could take some brainstorming with the team to get to the right topic. Almost every area of life has contrasts and so finding an ideal discussion topic should be the least of your worries."
"Fletcher, 2012, argues that adolescent motherhood affects the mothers\u2019 short and long-term health conditions as well as their economic and educational capabilities since adolescent motherhood has been linked to lower income and low educational attainments. Teenage motherhood reduces the opportunities mothers have in their lives while increasing their limitations and change of priorities making them indulge in behaviors that may be risky. Tobacco consumption is one of the coping mechanisms by the mothers to reduce distress during parenting and they more likely become obese and are less likely to quit smoking. Moreover, teenage parenthood affects mothers in their relationships and marriages since they end up with low quality choices in partners (Fletcher, 2012). Miscarriages in teen pregnancies are common since they may be as a result of trauma brought about by high depression levels while 25% of teen pregnancies end in abortion, 16% end in miscarriages and 298 in 1000 of teen pregnancies become live births."
"Another very interesting part of the film was when Lili Von Shupt, who is a German woman as well as a showgirl who tries to seduce Bart to stay with her. As they become alone in the room she is confident to make Bart fall in love with her basically. Before I get into that aspect of the film the reason Lili Von Shupt was told to do this by Hedley Lamar because he thought that Lili was capable of making any man fall for her. I\u2019m sure it is because she is a showgirl and well because she is a woman. Now, to the race part of this scene when the are in the room she asks him \u2018it is true what they say, about the way you people are gifted? Oh, it\u2019s true, it\u2019s true, it\u2019s true. Now to me this is a stereotypical race joke about black men. African-American men have been shown to have bigger private parts compared to other races.\u2019 Lili Von Shupt, then states it\u2019s true, which is probably to just exaggerate the fact of Bart\u2019s private part. As for Lili\u2019s part since she is a German, white girl she is shown to have the privilege to seduce Bart. Mel Brook\u2019s may have added this scene to show both races that it is a racial way to make comedy out of a sex scene."
"But unlike other social science disciplines, psychologists often concentrate on individual behavior and, specifically, in the beliefs and feelings that influence a person\u2019s actions. Principles of human rights and social justice are fundamental to social work. Similar to the counseling profession, social workers address the prevalence of inequity, discrimination, violations of human rights, and other forms of social injustice compromising and adversely affecting the well-being of society."
"\u201cMany studies show that one of the best ways to deal with the hardships in life is not to just centre on yourself but to take the opportunity to engage in simple acts of kindness,\u201d says Stephen G. Post, professor and author of the best-selling book The Hidden Gifts of Helping: How the Power of Giving, Compassion, and Hope Can Get Us Through Hard Times."
"This incident began on the morning of February 27th, 1947, when Chinese agents beat a woman to death for selling smuggled cigarettes on the street. The Taiwanese people responded to the excessive and extreme cruelty of this incident with a series of protests and riots. In an attempt to control the situation, leaders of the Chinese Nationalist Party, or the KMT, sent Chinese troops to exert military control over Taiwan. During this period of military control, individuals who had participated in the riots and rebellions were arrested and killed. In addition, many laborers, social elite, intellectuals, and thousands other people were arrested and killed without reason. In total, over 10,000 people were killed during the 228 Incident (Shiao-Feng, 2004)."
"By repeating Juliet\u2019s words shows his anger \u2018 \u2018Proud\u2019, and \u2018I thank you\u2019, and \u2018I thank you not\u2019 and yet \u2018not proud\u2019. Mistress minion you, Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds\u2019, also using offence words to hurt his only child, \u2018out you green- sickness carrion\u2019 and \u2018tallow face\u2019 meaning she is anaemic as a corpse, pale, ugly and a dirty person that should be living out with lower society of people with no status. I truly believe that he is a warm, gentle and jolly man, who loves his only lasting child very dearly, but is also bitter and loses his temper when thing are out of his control."
"\u201cApologise, pull out his eyes, pull out his eyes, apologise (Joyce 4).\u201d Later the reader finds that this symbolizes how his family will not accept his spontaneous outbursts, especially involving the arts. Its also important to note that even at this early part of his life, Stephen prefers his mother over his father, which shows later on in the novel. \u201d . . . he had a hairy face . . . his mother had a nicer smell than his father. (Joyce 3)\u201d In the first Chapter, at Clongowes, Stephen feels isolated."
"Many of the Chinese immigrants who were able to avoid deportation in 1882 were denied jobs and lived in fear that the exclusion laws would eventually catch up to them, leading to many to go great lengths to hide their identities and evade them. Chinese immigrants such as Lee Chew, described how his race had been \u201cshut out from working on farms or factories or building railroads or making streets or digging sewers\u201d immediately following the exclusion acts in the year of 1882. Chew similarly describes how the Chinese are treated the poorest in comparison to other ethnic groups of immigrants, stating \u201cThe Americans would not dare treat Germans, English, Italian, or even Japanese as they treat the Chinese, because if they did there would be a war\u2026\u201d Many desperate Chinese would attempt to enter the United States through means of crossing the Mexican or Canadian borders despite the risk and danger that becoming an undocumented immigrant entails."
"Deforestation can cause many societal and environmental problems which can make our lives on earth even more challenging. Some of these challenges include: loss of biodiversity, the destruction of forest- based societies and climatic disruption. According to the 1992 United Nations Earth Summit in Rio Janeiro, biodiversity may be defined as, \u201cthe variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are a part."
"In the process of what Sethe and Paul call \u2018rememory\u2019(Morrison, 107) we, as readers, are confronted with the reality of what love and life look like in a world of twisted conscience and we are left with the undeniable resiliency of human beings to continue to survive despite all attempts to dehumanize them."
"This was already evident to some of the characters in the book. Crook\u2019s for instance, foreshadowed what would happen later on to people with dreams. \u201c\u201dI never seen a guy really do it,\u201d he said \u201d I seen some guys nearly crazy with loneliness for land, but ever\u2019 time a whore house or a blackjack game took what it takes.\u201d\u201d(76). This book really showed that fate is eminent and no matter how you try or what you do, something will always try to stand in your way."
"on paper this would take an awful of time just to create one piece of the spreadsheet coursework, I would be creating bar chat to show how much of an item has been sold well with paper I would need to get paper pencil ruler but with an computer it would automatically generate one for me which would take seconds."
"Many African Americans, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Jamaicans and members of other nationalities that are of black descent, face discrimination today when in restaurants, renting apartments, buying a car, and many other services. I am a witness of this because I have been living in apartments since I came to the United States. Where I currently live, we have a Hispanic manager that admits she doesn\u2019t like to rent apartments to black people because they are troublemakers. This is denying African Americans the right to live there, which is known as racial discrimination."
"Identify food restrictions for religious groups. There are some foods that not everyone eats. When planning meals, it is good idea to find out what people can and cannot eat. Some religions have rules about food and they have rules about the way food is made, such as Jewish and Muslim families will only eat meat if the animal has been killed in a certain way."
"It is important to consider and understand why equality, diversity and individual rights are important in a health and social care setting. By recognising that integrating equality, diversity and individual rights into governance or policy will help to: achieve better outcomes for people, improve performance, demonstrate accessibility and accountability, and ensure compliance with the law."
"The other claim that explains why the death penalty should be abolished concerns the moral standing and ethical perspective of the policy. No doubt that the death sentence is unethical and morally wrong. When a person kills another, the best punishment is not to murder them too but to try them and make them get out of such thoughts. There is no way that a person can steal from thieves or get to rape this that takes part in rape to revenge. Such a case is, with no doubt, depredating to authorities concerned with penal (Wilson, 2016). When there is a case of revenge, it means that it is condoning crime by getting to repeat it. By murdering those that have murdered others, it is getting the focus away from the victims having attention on the criminals. Therefore, it would be good to get rid of the death penalty as a sentence in the US and all over the world."
"According to authors, Roger G. Dunham and Geoffrey P. Albert, there are several reasons concerning the reluctance to respond to domestic violence calls. The common issues that involve law enforcements lack of intervention include: Organizational impediments, lack of training, fear of injury and most importantly police attitudes. Domestic violence is misdemeanor, so in result police officers don\u2019t think of this assault as a \u201creal\u201d crime. They avoid making arrest as to conclude that domestic violence is a waste of time. It\u2019s common for police response to a domestic violence situation to lack enthusiasm or prolong making an appearance at all."
"When he is speaking with Lennie about his childhood, he is speaking like it is still happening or it has recently happened. This is a very similar story to his life at that present time. Being the only coloured man, Crooks is treated as an outcast, as racism was very high in those days which forces him to spend his time reading while the others are playing card games. Crooks become very bitter due to the fact that everyone ill treats him which makes him feel hurt. In the next chapter Curley is introduced to the story. He is the boss\u2019s son, he has a wife, she has dark hair that reaches down to her shoulders, her eyes are quiet close together and has pink small lips with very pale skin. The book does not mention anything about her name which suggests that she does not know who her parents are and does not have an identity."
"Low teachers\u2019 expectations, have been particularly cited by many researchers as contributing to low attainment amongst Black children (e.g. Gillborn and Youdell, 2000; Crozier, 2005; Maylor et al., 2006; Rhamie, 2007; DCSF, 2008b). Overall evidence suggests the disruptive or bad behaviour of Black children in the schools receive more adverse action against them than the pupils from other ethnicity. Black Caribbean children are getting excluded three times more than the exclusion rate of the entire pupil population (DfE 2015).Demie and McLean reveal the Black pupils when interviewed said that their teachers have told them that aren\u2019t going to achieve high education and wouldn\u2019t be getting in careers."
"The first piece of practical work we developed from the stimulus room, was based on the Ecclesiastes poem extract from the Bible. We focused on four particular lines from it: \u2018a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace. \u2018 We had to create a tableaux image of the four strong words in the poem; love, hate, war and peace. The first image out group started to work on was \u2018love\u2019. We decided each member of our group would hold a still image that represented various kinds of love. Georgina and I held a still image of two parents cradling a baby, showing their love for that child and each other."
"Another significant function design in my life is my older sibling. She is a surgical specialist in the navy. Although she is always busy studying, exercising, and doing her day-to-day responsibilities she calls me to keeps me on track and offers me recommendations. They keep me motivated to finishing my objective of becoming a Radiologist. To achieve my goal of majoring as a Radiologist I will complete my pre-requisites, stay focused in college, and stay arranged."
"This realization granted me a relief, encouraged me to follow what my heart wants without concerning others. I withdrew from some clubs, classes and began to spend more time for myself. I found new hobbies that I never knew before and shared them with people around me like Kpop or photography. I talked more about what I was enthusiastic about, rather than what other people liked. I became more open to share my story because I was not the only one who met difficulty with talking about feelings. More and more people came to me to talk about their problems or just to find someone for consolation. I remembered as I returned home that day, my heart was filled with guilt, apprehension, but also calmness. I accepted that my relationship with mom can not be improved. However, I am thankful her for expecting the best for me though it was in the wrong way. Everything that I have experienced built the person I\u2019m today, open-minded and accepting."
"If they were in love they wouldn\u2019t have done this to the children. When there is a divorce the children\u2019s safety blank is shattered. They feel that there is no body to trust and that they are alone is this situation. When you go to any city there are divorces there. There is at least one divorce on every city block. At is a lot to the way that it was in our parent\u2019s day."
"In spite all the variations in defining the concept, a clearer image of what corporate identity is emerges after studying its constructs and dimensions. This will be explored in the next section. Corporate identity: The structure What meant by structure is the components that constitute the corporate identity. Regardless of the difference in categorizations, researchers have more in common when it comes to studying the construct of corporate identity than they had in its definition."
"Minny\u2019s most recent employer Mrs. Walters is the mother of Hilly Holbrook who is the social leader of the community and head of the Junior League. One day the White population of the community decides to construct segregated bathrooms for the black servants as they think black people carrying diseases."
"The Journal also continues, \u201dWe have music for everything,\u2019 wrote one New York officer to his father, \u2018Music telling us when to get up, music telling us when to go to bed, when to get breakfast, when to eat dinner, when to clean streets, when to drill, when to stop drilling, when to go to church on Sabbath, and when to come back. All is told to us by drum and fife.\u2019 When music would play, it would be known that it is time for the next event, or place to be. \u201cThe Battle Hymn of the Republic,\u201d by William Steffe would be a common song to call soldiers into war and get them ready for marching. The music would be a very common way of services getting called. The Statesmen says, \u201cAs the outcome of the war seemed assured, there were more songs about the impending Union Victory.\u201d Beyond military operations, music also was an important part of life in camp and at home. The musicians with any smaller army for example, performed in parades, at concerts and at other patriotic events. It is believed that there were more than 400 musical bands in the Union army and 125 bands with the Confederate forces."
"The move is essentially in direct contrast with the actual course of action as implemented by Lee when he crossed the Potomac the first time. In this version, none of Lee\u2019s campaigns in the North ever come to be, most notably the Battle of Gettysburg. Instead, the South continues to fight a defensive war and eventually suffers the same defeats near Richmond, although likely years in advance of when it actually happened. Because Jackson refrains from advancing into Union territory, Lincoln\u2019s undenied goal to end the rebellion forces him to resupply the army of the Potomac, change its leadership, and strike back. This time, the Union Army easily runs over their southern counterparts and takes Richmond, crumbling the Confederacy from within. By midsummer 1862, the war is effectively over, a full three years before the real-life version came to an end."
"Later on in the book the Soseki father has passed along with his mother around the same time. His uncle who he had trust in persuade him to let him take over the house and the inheritance while he was in Tokyo continuing his education. Sure enough the exact words Sensei had told his peer happened. The uncle dwindled the inheritance of the Soseki thus causing hatred between the two sides. At this time I feel like very few people could be trusted altogether. If you had money there were always people trying to manipulate you and steal what in essence was given to you."
"Villagers must consider about their ability to deal with a living in problem-ridden city before they intend to move to big cities. Economic change has helped lead America into urban crisis for the following reasons. First of all, because urban problems are no longer confined to the inner city, but are regional in nature. The federal government has, also, largely drawn from the urban policy arena, thereby having cities and sates to develop their own solutions to local problems. Furthermore, the economy of cities is no longer organized around a central business district, but is dispersed throughout a metropolitan region."
"Chalmers argues they were viewed as a \u201csuper-secret organisation; masked and mysterious, with a tradition of violence for which a generation of legend had achieved a high measure of social approval. \u201d They were feared by the blacks and praised by the whites. Although the white supremacy organisations, such as the KKK played an important role in supporting racist actions and discrimination, they didn? t exist without a cause. This cause was the deep-rooted racism within American people as well as the social and economic fear after the \u201cGreat Migration\u201d and the First World War."
"In this article Williams discusses a recent problem to the debate of the death penalty. The article aims to inform the public that the death penalty is still a relevant debate in today\u2019s society through the use of interviews with Tony Abbott and other surveys in the past decade. The article focuses on _The Death Penalty Abolition Bill_ which has just recently been passed to block any state in the attempt to bring back capital punishment."
"Garcia was caught on store video confronting Jones in a convenience store parking lot at 2:30a.m on December 16, 2018. Garcia is then alleged to have shot and killed Jones. That night Garcia was involved in multiple shootings, including the shooting of a farm worker and robbery of a gas station in another town. Garcia is alleged to have a criminal record dating back to 2002 and apparently ordered to be deported in 2014 and had past multiple immigration holds\u201d (Salvi, ojjapc). This further proves the point that actions need to be taken by Congress and the Executive branch to secure our borders and put U.S. immigration laws into place. In current studies put together by fairus.org, 12-15 American Citizens are killed every day by illegal aliens. It is almost impossible to keep track of the illegals that flood into the country, so by not cracking down on regulations for them and making excuses that they need to be here, it becomes that much easier for these immigrants to violate the law. A border patrol agency identified 240,000 illegal immigrants who were convicted for criminal charges in 2017 alone."
"A replacement teacher, Sally Green, taught Ted\u2019s class for a term. She talked with the underachieving readers and noticed that they had rich imagery knowledge of the topics they discussed but often needed time to put their images into words. She helped them practice doing this. Before they began to read a narrative, she had them do this. Sally also had them talk in sentences about the pictures in the narratives and recall vocabulary. The students began to achieve as readers using their existing knowledge to read and to anticipate the ideas in a text."
"Landy realizes that the man she is working with to find Bourne is also corrupt. The CIA director Noah Vosen was Blackbriar\u2019s \u201coperational chief,\u201d She wasn\u2019t able to prove this if Bourne had acquired the files needed to prosecute the corrupt CIA officials. By achieving these files and confronting the officials Bourne was able to find his true identity."
"The time in which Golding was alive, events like Hiroshima, Dresden, his war experience and the prevalent problem of atomic and nuclear weapons post world war two highlights the worst in humans, the evil/savagery that is hidden in our nature. Exposure to such harsh realities would lead anyone to believe humans are innately evil however some people may refute that and go further to mention the ideology of it being easier to be mean than it is to be kind, explaining a lot of worldwide atrocities and ultimately the boys savage and violent behaviour."
"I now feel more confident when looking at a 2.0-year-old child in terms of physical development, stages and skills. It has given me the knowledge to notice if a child is not developing at the same rate as another child of the same age. It has given me knowledge on how to help a child who has not met their physical developmental target. This will help me for when I work in an ECCE setting."
"This demonstrates that Sarah is aware of her high level of knowledge in her cognitive abilities of logical reasoning because \u201cmake believe play improves that area of mental abilities\u201d (Berk, 2014, pp.228). Pretend play allowed Sarah to express representing what was going on in her mind. She was able to use her mind to come up with the scenario of her being a queen, with knowing that she actually is not one but is just using her capabilities in her cognitive reasoning to play make\u00bbbeliever Social-emotional development of a child is the ability to understand the feelings of others and control their own feelings and behaviors. There was a siren from an ambulance that went off in which Sarah reacted to, She did so by covering her ears with her hands. Sarah also closed her eyes and waited to open them again only after the sound of the siren went away \u201cBy the age of 4, children verbalize a variety of strategies for adjusting their emotional arousal to a more comfortable level. This is known as emotional self-regulation\u201d."
"Alcoholism, drunken driving, domestic violence, family troubles and; addiction are discussed in this film. Alcoholism is alcoholism irrespective of your class. Maniyan\u2019s dialogue: If rich people drink it is Fashion, If we drink it is alcoholism demonstrates this. Spirit also pokes at generally the useless and pretentious intellectual class who kind of romanticize the use of alcohol with clich\u00a9d phrases like Alcohol is bottled poetry. Spirit gives an insight into just how alcohol has become a solid part of Kerala life showing how people drink just for the sake of drinking. It shows those famous queues in front of beverage outlets. Although The movie is about Raghunandan\u2019s life, the characters of Maniyan and (thilakan) are important in conveying the message. In some instances it\u2019s seen Thilakan as an alcoholic and asks his student Maniyan to get a bottle of alcohol for him. This shows how desperate the man is to drinking. As seen in the movie Thilakan starts his day by drinking a glass of alcohol and he even drinks with his colleagues. In several instances it is shown that Plumber Manian drinks at least two glasses of alcohol to start his day as well as he even chews tobacco. It\u2019s even shown that he tortures his wife mentally and physically under alcoholic influence. This is actually affecting his family life as well as his kids are getting mentally affected seeing his daily act after getting drunk. He drinks even during lunch while mixing it in the food and also spends some time even during work. The same is said for the movie Neena. Though she is very good with her work, her alcoholism and smoking, along with her snobbish behavior, overshadows it. Even in this movie too it is shown that social drinking is a factor. During the office get together Neena gets drunk and falls into the swimming pool due to over alcoholic intake. It is seen that she spends her time on the sea-shore drinking from a bottle as well as that she even drinks when she gets involved with their client meetings. There are instances from asking a bottle of alcohol from her Boss as it a dry day on the first of every month to getting few bottles of alcohol from the beverage with the help from her Boss. Even alcohol as a danger element is playing a major part in parties.She says that she loves her Boss, later she realizes that her love was just because of being under alcohol. During their interactions, Neena gets attracted to Vinay and expresses her love to him. He rejects her request. Being unable to handle this, she absconds and attempts suicide. This showcases alcoholism. If she was a non-alcoholic she wouldn\u2019t have done this. Vinay, who was initially ambivalent about an affair with Neena, slowly resolves his internal conflicts and gets attracted to her during their stay in the de-addiction hospital. However, with her thinking skills improved after a brief period of sobriety and her impulsivity after professional interventions, Neena decides to become more practical and, in spite of being in love with him, decides to leave him. Her psychologist explains to Vinay that Neenas love for him was just an obsession under the influence of alcohol and that it has decreased with treatment. In the final scenes, Vinay,the boss binges to alcohol when his love got rejected from Neena. This makes him feel guilty and so he reaches to his wife.This movie attempts to display Neenas impulsive behavior as an outcome of her childhood experiences. Neenas parents, who had lost their adolescent son in a tragic event, wished for a boy during the second childbirth. Though they are disappointed when Neena, a girl, is born, they brought her up like a boy and made her dressed like one and spends her leisure time playing with boys who in turn address her as a boy. All this generates some gender identity issues in Neenas mind in her teenage. However, once she attains mensuration, her father changes his stand and starts restricting her interaction with boys. She rebels against it. She tries alcohol for the first time During the teenage days and gets rejected by her parents. Her initial curiosity towards alcohol and cigarettes is aroused in this stage by her friends, and is subsequently maintained by her anger towards own parents. Thus, the movie emphasizes that aim-less parenting, peer influences, conflicts in accepting her gender identity and the associated emotional turmoil led to Neenas alcoholism.The movie portrays alcoholism as a disorder than a bad habit. Neenas impulsivity and recklessness are shown to disappear dramatically during the short inpatient stay at the center. However, impulsivity displayed by patients of chronic alcoholism is reported, due to the damage alcohol causes to the frontal lobes of our brain and the reversal of such changes will take much more time than is depicted in this movie. Alcoholism effects on relationships can be quite harmful. The first area that is usually affected is intimacy, which doesn\u2019t always mean physical, either. Parts of an intimate relationship that can be affected by the effects of alcoholism include trust, stability, affection, expectations, commitment, shared values, Respect etc. When alcohol is involved this raises concern for codependency probabilities as well as abusive behavior both verbally and physically. Deterioration in married or unmarried couples often stems from arguments, financial troubles, and acts of infidelity or domestic violence."
"During martial law, Presidential Decree (P.D.)No. 1866 was enacted penalizing with death, among others, crimes involving homicide committedwith an unlicensed firearm.In the aftermath of the 1986 revolution that dismantled the Marcos regime and led to thenullification of the 1973 Constitution, a new constitution was drafted and ratified. The1987Constitutionprovides in Article III, Section 19 (1) that:Excessive fines shall not be imposed, nor cruel, degrading or inhuman punishment inflicted. Neithershall death penalty be imposed, unless, for compelling reasons involving heinous crimes, the Congresshereafter provides for it."
"Another aspect of poor upbringing and hardships she had to put up with is portrayed in her accent. It shows how the speaker did not receive proper schooling and hence the poor grasp of grammar right from the early age. The speaker says that \u201cI\u2019se been a-climbin\u2019 on\u201d (\u201cMother to Son\u201d, line 9) which does not depict good grammar as a result of poor educational background. There is a high possibility that she did not get opportunities for schooling in her early years of age."
"In recent times inclusion has become an increasingly important global issue with the advent of the Salamanca Statement (UNESCO, 1994), where 92 governments and 25 international organisations agreed that inclusion education of children within mainstream schools should become the norm. Inclusion has continued shape government policy, particularly in the UK with the coming to power of the New Labour government in 1997 which explicitly committed itself to the development of inclusive education."
"Me and Lennie met a few people today. There was this old guy called candy and he\u2019s got a stinkin\u2019 old dog. He\u2019s quit a nice fella though he told me about Curley and his wife. I met Curley just a bit after that convisation with Candy, he came in asking for his wife. He had a go at Lennie for no god damn reason at all. Candy reckons it\u2019s just coz Lennie\u2019s bigger than him. Curly\u2019s one of those small guys who hates big guys, but he better not pick on Lennie coz Lennie may be dumb but hell he\u2019s strong as a bull"
"I had the same exact struggles. My mother was very upset when I told her about my decision on going to school, she argues with me about how her friend\u2019s kids never came back to their homes and how they stop visiting their parents after they went to school. My mother was not being very supportive like Hooks parents were. She teaches us to how to be loving, caring, how to respect each other in the family and everyone else. She wanted for me just to find a job close to my house, she even talked with the owners of this pharmacy on the corner of my house to give me a job as a cashier. She said I should stay home and help her with the house chores, she never thought I could be anything more than a housekeeping. We lived in a very small town called Villa Canales which was eight hours away from the college I decided to go. That was the most painful decision I had ever made. After all I was the first generation going to college."
"Then we perform step of data analysis. For this purpose we used a standard\u00a0questionnaire that is prepared under the supervision of Prof. Rizwan and analyzed the different variables relevant to our topic. In this analysis we defined the central tendency and correlation among the variables. At the end some valuable findings and recommendations are given by our group."
"In conclusion, an ideal job consists of following the responsibilities on keeping a working environment as positive as possible and defining a clear mission and vision. Through projects and training opportunities, a positive workplace helps employees grow individually to find future positions that they desire for or earn to guide them in their journey. Although, employees will only move to the right path if they are taught the correct qualities that will lead them to performing an excellent job and keeping the cycle going using these key characteristics. To remain having a happy workplace, keep important personal touch when forming relationships with employees to show that they matter and listening to staff suggestions and what not instead of shutting them down or seem uninterested, by creating a good feedback and implementation loop, it increases the likelihood of job place satisfaction."
"I strongly disagree with the above statement as when you choose to become a parent you should be ready to love a child unconditionally. You should not get the right to pick specific characteristics in your children, God created us all to be special in our own way and how he wants us to be. He knows what is right for us so why would you want to change what he has created."
"Neither route benefits anyone involved. In conclusion, I am able to deduce that problems in marriage can be hard on children. They often experience a negative change in their behavior demonstrating aggression towards others and developing insecurities and loss of trust. The change in behavior does not only occur in a child\u2019s early stages of life but it also affects the different areas throughout the rest of their lives. Every future relationship that a child has can be hampered by the indiscretions of one selfish parent. Therefore everyone in the family should take special care not to allow the satisfaction of their own personal feelings to damage this construct that is so important to a child\u2019s development."
"There are many devastating things happening in the United States. It can be argued that things are going downhill, and America isn\u2019t learning from their past mistakes. Racial discrimination and immigration are topics a lot of Americans don\u2019t like to talk about, but equality is at stake. Not many people realize how truly awful things are in the world right now, and instead of everyone just trying to getting along, or at the very least ignoring each other, people are dying at the hands of causes that shouldn\u2019t even exist. It shouldn\u2019t be a questions over whether or not one race is more superior. The color of someone\u2019s skin doesn\u2019t define how smart they are, or how much they can do. All races are beautiful in their own way. Neo-nazis, white supremacists, black separatists, the Ku Klux Klan, etc. need to see that loving your own race doesn\u2019t mean that other races need to be put down. Everyone can win. One race doesn\u2019t have to be angry for another to be happy. The heroes of America\u2019s past and present that are fighting for equal rights are just trying to show that racial discrimination is wrong. I think that fighting for what you believe in is an extremely courageous thing to do. Donald Trump\u2019s immigration views are something that can be fought against. It\u2019s something that will be fought against. The first amendment states that \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d This law means that people are free to believe and think what they want. I will never promote violence among groups of people, but simply educate people on the way that all people deserve to be treated. Racism is wrong, and no one deserves to be treated as if they are less pure than anyone else because of the color of their skin."
"\u201d(7). In Hayes\u2019s statement, when stating \u201ca African-American male review,\u201d it demonstrates society\u2019s constant judging and monitoring of African-American people in a more local scenario. The quotation also shows how African-American people may be treated differently because of the moderating with Hayes\u2019s following statement, \u201cBy suits in the offices, the courts & waiting rooms.\u201d The quote eludes to law enforcement with the statement \u201csuits in the offices\u201d and how they are treating African-American people wrong because of the constant criminalizing with the statement afterwards, \u201ccourts & waiting rooms.\u201d The whole statement is an allusion to the justice system with reference to the court of law and shows how African-Americans might get treating unfairly in the system when committing a crime. Hayes also attacks another local problem when talking about African-American modern music, Hayes states, \u201cAfrican-American Modern music may begin, almost / Carelessly, to breathe n-words. Yes, even the most / Bespectacled hallucination cruising the lanes / Of America may find her tongue curls inwards.\u201d(15). The quote parades around the use of saying the n-word in music and states how it became a \u201cBespectacled hallucination;\u201d this metaphor is used to show how people have voluntarily turned a blind eye to the n-word in pop culture music. Hayes also takes a stab at the word nigga\u2019 and states how it\u2019s relatively the same as the n-word, he states, It feels sadder when a black person says Nigga / Because it sounds like Nigger.(44). The quotation shows the disappointment and emotions Hayes feels towards the African-Americans who use this word as he feels like using it will water down the meaning of the n-word shown by his following quote, No word leaves me more graced by shame.(44). Haye\u2019s sonnets ultimately demonstrates the local racism that African-American individuals may go through; and as a result, it links back to systemic racism through the oppression of the court of law. Hayes also demonstrates the use of the n-word and brings light to the fundamentals of the word through society\u2019s norms and music.One of Hayes\u2019s ultimate goals is to shed light on the conflict between the African-American society and the American Government. For example, Hayes states, \u201cAre you not the color of this country\u2019s current threat / Advisory?\u201d(10) Hayes reveals the African-American society\u2019s point of view when talking about the \u201cthreat Advisory,\u201d showing that just having the same color person in office doesn\u2019t change the action of others; this also relates to the writers Feagin and Elias who argue that there is a \u201cone-sided emphasis on \u2018meaning of race'\u201d(Feagin and Elias 15). Feagin and Elias describe racial difficulties as a problem of color blindness where people become too blind of racial problems that they become racist themselves; this is a correlation to Hayes\u2019s reference to the advisory because the government have become too color blind that they don\u2019t notice the racist actions they might be doing. Another example of the conflict between the American government and the African-American community is when Hayes states, \u201cMaxine Waters, being of fire, being of sword / shaped like a silver tongue. Cauldron, siren, / African-American as tarnation, African-American as the consciousness.\u201d(23) The quote talks about Maxine Waters, Waters is mentioned because of her constant fight with the American government and more importantly Donald Trump. Maxine Waters is a African-American United States Representative that is not afraid to speak her mind on certain topics, she is an activist for the African-American society; this is why Hayes uses her for his sonnet and describes her as a \u201cfire\u201d and \u201csword.\u201d One of the most well known fights Waters has done is between Her and Donald Trump, she has debunked many things Trump has said and has attacked him for many racist actions he has done over the years.Hayes\u2019s book makes many references to the American president Donald J. Trump, he attacks him for his constant racism not only for African-Americans, but for other non white ethnicities. For example, Hayes states Goddamn, so this is what it means to have a leader / you despise, the racists said when the president / was African-American and i\u2019ll be damned if I ain\u2019t saying I too.(38). The quote represents Donald Trump when referring to leader and attacks him for the racist things that he has said in the past when Barack Obama was president. Donald Trump is a consistent racist who denies his actions as being racist, Hayes knows this is a well known fact and uses Trump as a example to show systematic racism on a government level. The sonnet attacks Donald Trump for his constant defending of thinking he is allowed to say racist things about Mexicans because he has mexican friends and family, Hayes states You are not allowed to say shit about Mexicans when you / Ain\u2019t actually got any Mexican friends-I bet you\u2019ve never / been invited to a family dinner.(38). Hayes is accusing Donald Trump of lying about his friends and family that are mexicans and suggests that even if he does have family and friends that are mexicans, they wouldn\u2019t be friendly to him because of his racist type of character. In conclusion, Terrence Hayes\u2019s American Sonnets for my Past and Future Assassin sheds light on many of the problems society has when it comes to systemic racism. Hayes does a excellent job demonstrating the systemic racism in areas such as local, historical and political patterns in the USA. Hayes sheds light on many public figures that are either fighting racism like Maxine Waters or demonstrating racism like Donald J. Trump, it also shows many examples of racism that have been widely accepted by society and informs the audience that this racism still should be condemned..The poem also demonstrates a good understanding of the struggles African-American people have to go through in society and shows how Hayes is trying to help, he states, America\u2019s struggle with itself has always had people like me at the heart of it.(38); this shows his compassion to help end systematic racism in today\u2019s society."
"Foreign-born persons (in the United States) accounted for 16.4 percent of the local labor force \u2013 23.1 million people (Singer 2012). Furthermore, over one in every four foreign workers in the United Stated are Mexican \u2013 made up approximately 4 percent of labor force (Grieco & Ray 2004). Furthermore, according to Labor Force survey of Eurostat (2013), in 2012, 8.6 million foreigners who came from outside Europe worked in 27 countries in Europe. These data figures suggest that the supplementation of migrants from developing countries into labor force in developed countries were strong evidence for the benefit of migration. However, it has been argued that migration leads to brain drain in developing countries."
"Animal testing can be conducted anywhere from a university to a military defense establishment, wherever there is a need for testing a product. Products to be tested will range from cosmetics to pesticides and anything in-between. Animal testing has been around for over 500 years, since the early 17th century, though testing for cosmetic purposes did not start until the 1930s. Animal testing has been highly debated for many years for whether it is moral, ethical, humane, right, wrong, just, fair, etcetera."
"The main character, the wife, does not fit into her time described as rebellious and independent women. She has traveled a lot and has great experience in love and has intimate relations with men. The Wife of Bath has married five men challenging Christian morality and norms. The Wife of the Bath has had five husbands: three \u201cgood\u201d and two \u201cbad\u201d husbands. Using personal experience, the wife underlines that balance of power between spouses helps to control over marital relationship. During the Middle Ages, the women had no right to choose their husbands because their destiny depended upon will of their fathers and social status of their families."
"Daphne is a divorced single mother wrapped in loneliness. She fears that her Milly will become her clone in unsuccessful relationship. Determined to take Milly out of her same predicament, Daphne secretly posted an ad in search for a man for her daughter. She interviews the prospect guys in a restaurant and screens them. Milly ended up dating two guys \u2013 Johnny and Jason. In the end, she chooses Johnny who is much more like her. She also found out from Jason what her mom did. When is about to confront her mother, she discovers that her mother and Joe, Johnny\u2019s father are into a serious relationship."
"Next, the national economy has experienced a fundamental reorganization and many cities have experienced the direct effects of deindustrialization and disinvestments. Additionally, the fiscal crisis within the public sector is unprecedented and has seriously negative effects for the provision of services at all levels of government. Finally, the nature of work itself has changed within cities as more women enter the labor market; the changing nature of work has affected the urban family in many ways, many of which have direct ramifications for social welfare and family policies."
"Immigrants do lower the country\u2019s economic status. Unemplyment rate for immigrants is higher then that of Native Dutch people because of the poor knowledge of dutch, low levels of education, and limited work experience. Average immigrants also have less money then the Average Dutch person. As well as crime rates are higher then average among the young immigrants. 8 percent of immigrant youngsters have been suspected of crime while only 4 percent of the Dutch. Policies were made to increase the self-sufficiency of newcomers. Immigrants were required to pass an integration exam that tests their knowledge of the Dutch language and society. The Netherlands is currently the only country in the world to demand knowledge of language and society from its inhabitants before allowing them to stay."
"I barely got sleep because I\u2019m too busy thinking about how my life would be if she was here. Parents play a very important role in most children\u2019s academic development. Grief and mourning can be a long, painful process which could impact their school performance. At a point in high school, focusing on my work became very difficult. Days blurred together as missed classes became a normal thing. I tried getting help but I was left with a hole that just couldn\u2019t be filled. The reality of knowing that she will never see me graduate mange to break my heart each and every day. But with the support from friends, family, and teacher each day gets a little bit easier. I\u2019ve found that the worst thing to do is try to face this battle alone, because that will always be a battle that you can\u2019t win. All you have to do is reach out. Utilize the resources you have around you and know that with time things will get easier. The wound will start to heal. I\u2019m currently doing much better now but this is an experience that I will never forget."
"But through it all, I most importantly witnessed the kindness of others. The kindness of people who would give us rides to and from home, of people who brought us meals, of our family friend who bought our home from us, allowing us to live there, so we would not be living on the streets. These people helped me through these tough times. These were the people who kept me smiling. Similar to the noiseless photograph itself, I am quiet. I was not a loud child. I did not know many other kids when I was two, so my twin brother and I were best friends. We had a special bond that no one could ever replace. If he felt sad, I felt sad. If he was happy, I was happy. Our relationship was, and still is unbreakable. We used to play on our the swing set all the time. My brother Jonah and I would play for hours outside."
"The crime was on a steady rise until this point, taking everyone by surprise. Experts rushed to try to explain the phenomenon, trying to answer the most important question, where did all the criminals go? The authors review the most popular explanations experts provided to explain this sudden event, ultimately unveiling that only a few explanations: the increased reliance on prisons, increased number of police, and the legalization of abortion, actually affected the crime rate."
"Tension between the Blacks and other races in the locality was rife during that time but numerous reforms have already been passed to address the issues, and multi-cultures have also become more accepted in the US. In short, a lot of things have changed since then. Nevertheless, the situation is still far from ideal for the minority races in the US, hence, continuing vigilance is still necessary to carry on with what Director Lee has initiated in this film."
"Ramadan consists of special prayers cited and foods served only during this period. In the 27th day Muslims commemorate the night of power when Muhammad received God\u2019s revelation and the Ramadan ends with celebration of Eid al-Fitr to break the fast and give gifts (Esposito, 2002). Ramadan is meant\u00a0to stimulate reflection of believers on dependence of God, spiritual values and responsibility to care for less fortunate. The fifth pillar is the Pilgrimage also known as Hajj to Mecca in Saudi Arabia and requires all able adult Muslims worldwide to visit the city at least once in their lifetime. It follows Ramadan and requires sacrifices of time, things and comforts hence making Muslims pilgrims in God\u2019s service. There is also lesser pilgrimage called umrah that that involves visits to other holy sites during other periods of the year."
"In the case of Syd Gilman and Rochelle Beauport in Hy Dairies Incorporation, Beauport works in brand management at Hy Dairies and succeeds to boost the sale of HY\u2019s gourmet ice cream. Syd Gilman offers her the recently vacated position of market research coordinator as a platform to widen her experience in top-level management and also would increase her salaries. Beauport is happy about this good news. Unfortunately, she thinks that market research coordinator is just a sideline department to Hy Dairies Incorporation and technical support to an organization."
"To begin our look into the past, we\u2019re going to start with the first book cover that Of Mice and Men released with in 1937. The 1930\u2019s were a busy year for Steinbeck. We see that the bottom of the cover says \u201ca novel by John Steinbeck author of Tortilla Flat\u201d."
"Revenge is what most people like to do, including with religion, it can also have a play too. There can be riot erupted by groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood which have fought with other religions that have been problems from the past and yet still bring them up and burn churches just for the sake of revenge. Some reason for their moves of revenge of what they are doing is , \u201cThe Brotherhood members regarded attacking the churches as their revenge against Coptic Egyptians who made their stance against the Brotherhood and support for the Armed Forces quite clear during the June 30 revolution\u201d (\u201cMuslim Brotherhood Sued\u2026\u201d)."
"In the scene Dumbo ends up falling from the tree where the crows have been taunting him. Again, the crows rudely approach Dumbo for more taunting and finally Timothy Q. Mouse Says, \u201cGo on. Fly up a tree where you belong\u201d (23). Though this line is a racially loaded statement, it goes unnoticed and the crows begin to perform a Jazz piece called \u201cWhen I See an Elephant Fly\u201d. The piece was created and recorded by Cliff Edwards (known for voicing Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio and his hit single \u201cSinging in the Rain) and Hall Johnson, a famous Julliard trained African American composer and choral director. Noticeably, this scene exhibits problematic racial issues and these ideas are perpetuated through the music of the score, however an educated African American composer was a part of the creation of this music. This fact brings forth a very important historical reality: during this time, stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination were a reality."
"During the Test Phase, two objects from the same category but different colour was shown at the same time \u2013 a yellow bottle and a blue bottle. The children were then assigned randomly to one of two conditions. In the control condition, they heard a neutral phrase \u2013 \u201cNow look. What do you see now?\u201d In the anaphoric condition, subjects heard a phrase containing the anaphoric expression one \u2013 \u201cNow look. Do you see another one?\u201d The assumption in this preferential looking experiment is that infants prefer to look at an image that matches the linguistic stimulus, if available. The prediction is that in absence of a linguistic stimulus, infants would prefer looking at the new image \u2013 the blue bottle."
"Non-commissioned officer and the other Officers work together and complement each other as a unit. However, research conducted by Army Research Institute revealed that there has been problem between officers and Non-commission officers. non commissioned officer and Officers have conflicts over the sharing of their duties, it is said that some Officers perform all the duties leaving NCO with nothing to do. these officers want to perform training as well as micromanage; they also want the lower rank soldiers and civilians to report directly to them. This kind of actions leaves non commissioned officer\u2019s with titles and responsibilities while rendering them powerless. Surprisingly, the research also pointed out that ethical conduct of some battalion commanders is not up to the standard. Some commanders, compromise their ethics while discharging their duties and this influences the moral behavior of the other junior officers. affirm that there is no military all over the world that matches the quality of Non-commissioned officers of the United States of America."
"B Du Bois, Booker T. Washington, and Ida B. Wells-Barnett (Baym et al. , 2008). The nature of Naturalism has been debated as being the opposite of realism or as \u201cextension or intensification of realism\u201d (Baym et al. , 2008, p. 7). Naturalism usually describes more extreme settings and circumstances than realism and focuses on harsher conditions and poorer characters. Baym et al. (2008) suggest that while characters in realistic works often overcome difficulties, in naturalistic pieces the characters never stand a chance. It is a much more pessimistic literary style than realism."
"The objective of the current study is to provide a comprehensive review of literatures related to the application and advantages of each fabrication method of SOFCs. The fabrication methods discussed in the current study are photolithography process, sintering process and infiltration process. These processes are used for fabrication of nanomaterials on electrolyte, anode and cathode respectively. In this research, the methods are discussed using one nanomaterial for each fabrication method. The nanomaterial used for photolithography is YSZ (yttrium stabilized zirconia) [1, 2], for sintering is NiO/YSZ [3, 5] and for infiltration is metal salt nitrate [4]. These materials would increase the power output and performance of SOFCs. Different nanomaterials can also be used other than the mentioned, for improving the performance. The long term goal of the research is to help the researchers to understand the impact of use of nanomaterials in SOFCs."
"In the 1960s women are given more rights and are allowed to be educated and work outside the home. As in earlier times, women were not to be seen or heard their main purpose was to tend the home and take care of the children. The structure of family and marriage has changed in today\u2019s times. In September of 1996 President Bill Clinton banned the bill of same-sex marriages because a legal marriage union consists of one man and one woman. Then in December of 1996, a state court in Hawaii passed a law recognizing gay and lesbian couples to have the same rights as married couples. It wasn\u2019t until 2015 in California that the legislature passed a bill to legalize same-sex marriages, but not illegal in all fifty states. Families today consist of two males or females as parents, extended families living together to afford living costs, and single-parent households. No matter what issues we face in family and marriage the government will have some say so in how we live. Although Americans are free to make their own choices, laws can affect culture and culture may affect beliefs. The government interferes to ensure adults are responsible in their marriages, that children are properly cared for by families. Many feel that the government has no right to regulate one\u2019s marriage. People feel that marriage has nothing to do with the powers of the federal government, so it has no place in families or marriages."
"We deliver our Curriculum following planning methods to ensure that the activities, resources and focused group time sessions are suitable for a topic we need to cover. This comes from the observations of children made by us practitioners. In my setting. we believe that active learning supports children to develop vital skills and knowledge and promotes a positive attitude to learning. (Article 28, 29)"
"The #NeverAgain movement on Twitter has received a lot of attention from popular web publications and political and media theorists. For instance, Nick Bilton writes for Vanity Fair that this movement has proven that the youth, primarily those in \u201cgeneration Z,\u201d have proven there is great promise in internet-based political work during the present and future to come. Bilton points out some of the most popular tweets of the online movement, such as Carly Novell, a 17-year-old student at M.S.D. who wrote a critical tweet of a Fox News host\u2019s anti-gun limitation tweet and received almost 900,000 likes on Twitter. #NeverAgain has demonstrated the very responsive and influential power of social media as a means of rallying support and raising awareness. When we recognize that certain opinions and viewpoints are being seen and engaged with in the range of hundreds of thousands of times, then there is no doubt that political positions are being strengthened. As Bilton says, \u201cthe Parkland students have done an astounding job preventing the news cycle from forgetting about their tragedy.\u201d Without a constant dialogue about a political issue, it tends to fall by the wayside, which prevents any movement to make meaningful changes. Through Twitter, the #NeverAgain activists have ensured that the world doesn\u2019t forget about what happened, and also of the necessity for political change."
"I think everyone encounters community service everyday of their life, I want to do community service I want to coach little kids in basketball I think that will build a good community as a whole. It will have a big impact on people lives for doing community service. There was a good role model in my community his name was Coach John. He used to coach little league basketball he had everybody on the team to have good spirit."
"This paper describes the causes and effects of domestic violence. To begin with a number of studies have looked into identifying individuals who are most at risk for domestic violence. The most common feature is an imbalance of power and control. However, neither those who experience domestic violence nor the partners who abuse them fall into distinct categories. They can be of any age, ethnicity, income level, or level of education. The following are examples of situations that are common among people who experience domestic violence. It is important to understand that anyone can be abused. Individuals at risk may who is Planning to leave or has recently left an abusive relationship, Previously in an abusive relationship, Poverty or poor living situations, Unemployed, Physical or mental disability, Recently separated or divorced , Isolated socially from family and friends, Abused as a child, Witnessed domestic violence as a child, Younger than 30 years and Stalked by a partner. Although the abusers also share some common characteristics, it is important to note that abusers choose violence to get what they want in a relationship. Risk factors may point to an increased likelihood of violence in a relationship, but the person is not destined to become violent because of the presence of certain risk factors. Nor is the violence justifiable because it happened while the abuser was in a blind rage that he or she was powerless to control. The following factors may indicate an increased likelihood that a person may choose violence. Abuser risk factors: Abuses alcohol or drugs, the use and abuse of alcohol are strongly associated with a higher probability that the drinker will be involved in violence as victim, perpetrator, or both. Illicit use of drugs by household members increases a woman\u2019s risk of death at the hands of a spouse, lover, or close relative by a 28-fold factor. Concomitant use of alcohol and illicit drugs is associated with a 16-times greater risk for suicide, a risk substantially higher than that observed for the use of either individual substance. In a small study (n = 46) examining the relationship between selected socioeconomic risk factors and injury from domestic violence, alcohol abuse by the male partner, as reported by the female partner, was the strongest predictor for acute injury. Approximately half of the victims stated that their male partners were intoxicated at the time of the assault. Whether male partner intoxication is a direct causal factor, an indirect factor, or a factor that modifies the effect of a causal factor has not been determined. On the day of the assault, 86% of assailants reportedly used alcohol, with 67% using the combination of alcohol and cocaine. The active metabolite of such a drug combination, coca ethylene, is more intoxicating, longer lived, and possibly more potent in its ability to kindle violent behavior than are the parent drugs."
"This doesn\u2019t mean that problems found in single-parent homes are because of the parent who raises the children. It can be associated to things other than single parenting. Single-parent households are generally less well-off financially and this may be a major cause of family problems. Low-income families face issues of lower education levels and lower economic achievement which can often leave the child feeling isolated and lonely (Vangorodska 2012). As well, children in single-parent households have little to no supervision, because by having the only parent in the households, that\u2019s most likely not at home, due to being at work most of the time. It\u2019s also less communication between the child and the parent."
"There are no other cases quite like pregnancy, where one\u2019s ability to sustain life is directly dependent on the use of another\u2019s body. This is why Thomson must create the violinist analogy. There are surely many similarities between the case of the violinist and the case of the fetus. As stated before, both parties, the fetus/violinist and the mother/donor are innocent."
"Children and young people are affected emotionally and behaviourally when they face domestic violence and the effects could be long term and would continue to ensure safety of the children. Children also construct their own social world and timely and individualized personalized responses have been considered as more appropriate. Timely and appropriate individually tailored responses to build resilience in the child\u2019s life could mean significant implications for responses."
"It is argued that pregnancy caused rape or incest affects women\u2019s mental health and for that reason the victim should not be obliged to carry the fetus to viability. psychological studies have shown that when given the proper support, most pregnant rape victims progressively change their attitudes towards their unborn child from one something repulsive to someone innocent and uniquely worthwhile."
"It also is the start of the pattern of each of them having something to do with the suicide of Eva Smith. The second climatic curtain is after act two, Eric walks in after he left the house and when they have all just realized that he is the father of Eva Smiths child. Eric: You all know, don\u2019t you? This is when the curtain goes down."
"As a character is referred to as \u201cSlim the jerk-line skimmer\u201d who is admired for the skill he has in the way he works. The difference between peoples work in the two stories is that in \u2018The Three Strangers\u2019 a job is for life as you are told \u201cyou can tell a mans work by his hands. \u201c. The leisure of the people in Hardy\u2019s \u2018The Three Strangers\u2019 is fairly different to that of the people in Steinbeck\u2019s \u2018Of Mice and Men\u2019. In Hardy\u2019s story, the characters rarely celebrate as money is tight, but they hold civilised parties for courtship and socialising."
"Furthermore, some Americans believe that immigrants are a waste of American resources, but there is the responsibility of the country to provide help to immigrants who are fleeing violent country. As a society we have neglected that our countries need our help. Immigrants are fleeing violent countries where the violence will not end immediately but over time and are seeking help to get into a country of dreams but aren\u2019t gaining it because we are selfish. America standards needs to be remind of our history and how the country was built on immigration. Humans today need to learn to help on another to build a prospering country. The view of American has to be changed for the better. What makes a person American is not just being born in the country but it is believing in the American standards and putting faith into a constitution that will provide us human rights. People are coming to America as immigrants to be apart of this American dream that Americans value, but the only way that they can become one with society is with a change by people and a change of values. America needs to start believing in that immigration is the backbone of this nation, it was how the place got created. Americans are not just created by birth or blood buts in the belief that this nation is a place of standards built on immigration. As humans, the country\u2019s next chapter needs to bring a change on how immigrants are viewed as and lend a helping hand to those who need asylum."
"The relationship between John proctor and Elizabeth is very complicated or very frustrating. You can tell inside they do love each other very much but things have changed and went on two directions for both of them. There have been lots of hurdles going on between them. In a way such as a john proctor\u2019s relationship with Abigail is one of the main reason that made the relationship goes up and down because Abigail keeps comes back to find John and lured in between John and Elizabeth."
"Therefore this shows that people with too much freedom can get corrupted, yet people with slightly less freedom, can enjoy life as well as be on the right path in society. However some children are used to staying at home and enjoying their time either by \u201ccooking, reading or playing games\u201d. Basit, T (1997). This is however jus an assumption that has been made that many people may disagree with depending on there traditions and culture. In conclusion it shows that traditions, culture and upbringing play a major role in today\u2019s society."
"But by killing Bunbury its made you feel that Algernon is serious about marriage and wants to be with one woman, Cecily. I also feel that near the end of the play when it is discovered that Jack is really Algernon\u2019s older brother, he has become a bit jokey with Jack as he calls him \u201cold boy\u201d, but I think that Algernon feels that he is in a higher class than Jack still, even though they are brothers as he then calls him \u201cmy dear boy\u201d, so Algernon isn\u2019t treating Jack with much respect there. I feel that Algernon likes to be respected, but doesn\u2019t like to respect other people."
"The display of About.com is very nice and unique but it has so many features that list on the main page, which might cause the confusion for users. For Google, it\u2019s very simple in their page display and it also has its own ways of setting for their features, where users able to explores and tweak things around to find the most closest search results for their dream career. But at the end of this assignment, the most easy and useful search engine that suit for students, whom search for their dream career, was Google search engine due its most advance in the features that have the best capability in filtering out all the unnecessary information to narrow to the target topic."
"In conclusion, I can say that this family interaction has led me to reflection on my practice and exploration as a nursing student about to graduate and assisted me to identify my own learning needs in working effectively with families. It has led to a better practice as a graduating nurse, which is better informed and professional, that before the reflection."
"The poem by Duffy, \u2018In Mrs. Tilscher\u2019s Class\u2019, is a direct contrast of this, delivering scenes of happiness and learning, of new experiences. The first word of the whole poem, \u2018You\u2019, is very important. It suggests being personal, as if the poem is almost casual in it\u2019s language. This idea keeps up throughout the writing. The order of events and topics throughout the poem tilt towards spontaneity, being slightly random in the way the memories are dictated, and phrases are used as a supplement for sentences, which might be as the lingual equivalent of snapshots, or pastings from times past. Description is also important in portraying happiness in an educational environment:"
"Don\u2019t get me wrong killing an adult human is wrong because that is life that has already been birthed, and established. Abortion should be a choice that we are able to make on our own. This is my body I should be able to freely decide what to do with it. We are able to freely tattoo and pierce our bodies without any type of interference from the government. So why can I not make a decision to end a pregnancy that I carefully tried to avoid. I also feel that abortion when done early on in the pregnancy would not cause any harm to the fetus."
"\u201cLook at Mexico. We need to make the government better and end the corruption. If people have a better life in their country, they won\u2019t come over here\u201d(Garza,Tony). It\u2019s needless to say that the government needs to change. People are going to be looking for asylum because it isn\u2019t safe for them in their own country or they are trying to make a better life for themselves and their families. In a recent tweet, President Donald Trump attempts to portray migrants as criminals, Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants, many of whom are stone cold criminals, back to their countries."
"The most recognizable prejudice in this novel was the ablelism toward Lennie. Lennie, the main character of the book, had some type of mental disorder that prevented him from remembering things and also from controlling the motor function and decision making concerning his hands, but of course in\u00a0this time period there was no knowledge of such diseases. Lennie was the most kind-hearted, innocent character in this book because he doesn\u2019t understand superficial alienation or prejudice toward someone because of their sex, race, age, etc. He can\u2019t take care of himself, so his best friend George tells him what to do. During one part of the book when George is talking to Slim, George talks about how he used to treat Lennie: \u201c\u2018I used to have a hell of a lot of fun with him."
"Social survey design is a popular and commonly used strategy in social science research and is frequently used to answer who, what, where, how much and how many questions. They allow the collection of large amount of data from a sizable population in a highly economical way. Social Survey Design allows researchers to carry out studies in natural real life settings using probability samples thus increasing external validity of the studies. Using a social survey design will give you more control over the research process and when sampling is used, it is possible to generate findings that are a representative of the whole population at lower cost than collecting the data for the whole population. 1.9.2 SAMPLING TECHNIQUE"
"In this research, a literature study will help me for proposing a theoretical framework, model and hypothesis. In this phase, a deep interview will be used and for analyzing the result, the coding method will conduct and then a model will produce. After that, field study will be applied and for testing hypothesis by questionnaire data will be collecting. For conducting this research, all three players of the voluntourism should participate including volunteering organizations, volunteer tourists and host communities. In the first phase, the interview will be used as a tool for collecting qualitative data and the second phase uses a questionnaire for collecting quantitative data. In this research at least two NGO or volunteering organization should participate, preferably those who have been using different channels for marketing, one destination that characterize the host community and finally the volunteer tourists will be chosen among those who are skilled ranged from 25-30 years old. The size of the statistic population will be determined by the Krejcie Morgan table."
"The talk of immigration has become a very controversial topic in today\u2019s politics and society. Although there are many reasons why foreign born immigrants could cause damage and lay waste to the United States, there are also a lot of positive effects that can possibly occur. The cost of deportation could drop tramendacly over time, the birth of anchor babies will have a high chance of decreasing due to immigrants becoming citizens. Yes problems such as a rise in violence could occur, but by working together to change these issues may have a more of a positive effect instead of negative. Equal rights should be allowed for everyone, citizens or not."
"Research into language acquisition has certainly come a long way, and many of these questions would not even have been asked if it weren\u2019t for Chomsky\u2019s theory. In years to come, Chomsky\u2019s UG might be proven to be conclusively incorrect, and another theory might take its place instead, but we would not be able to get there, without always referring to Chomsky."
"The Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act, Pub. L. 108-275, 118 Stat. 831, on the other hand, characterizes penalties for identity theft crimes (18 U. S. C. Sec. 1028A (a)). It also furthers providing penalties for those that hold information in conducting the crime, not considering if they themselves essentially use the information to take an identity. In 2003, Chief Darrel Stephens of North Carolina Police Department conducted a survey on the degree of preparedness of major police organizations."
"This Earth is permanent and all things here will come to pass by. Thus, instead of complaining, thank God for he is just molding you to be a better person than you are today. Thank God for every breath you take and for every heartbeat. Praise God for all the sufferings, who knows? It is just a blessing in disguise. You may not understand it now but when time comes you will realize how better his plan is for you than what you are planning for yourself. Be happy! And always be thankful for everything has a reason. Always put in your mind that happiness is your choice!"
"Due to the context of the time, being a woman gave you a lower social status than men \u2013 many were seen as second rate to their male equivalents. They had less power than men, this was displayed through having less rights, particularly when it came to democracy and voting \u2013 less control. She was confined by her social status as a woman. This makes her level of power in the novel significantly lower than Curley\u2019s \u2013 adding to the idea that she is presented as one of the weak ones."
"His case had been sent to the court and had undergone series of trials but the council had decided death as his punishment for rebellion, sedition and illegal association. He was sent to New Land on the 30th of December 1896 for his death penalty by 7 o\u2019clock in the morning. Villaruel was accompanied by the artillery of soldiers and was tasked to walk to the middle of the square where he was then shot and was then brought to an unknown place where he was buried. Since the authorities thought that Villaruel\u2019s operation was a failure."
"To each turn of the story, Attia Hosain brings a superb imaginative understanding and a sense of the \u201cpoignancy of the smallest of human dramas. \u201d The short story reveals the hidden depths of Hosain\u2019s work and brings out not only the partition theme but also the dilemma of the Indian bride and her relationship with her husband. Ones first party is supposed to be a really exciting, unforgettable and enjoyable experience. However here the title suggests the irony of the situation."
"This is the true essence of friendship because a strong friendship should not only be based upon the benefits one derives from the other or from the relationship itself but also on the willingness to sacrifice and to sometimes let go of personal desires to give way to more meaningful and more important issues in favor of the other or of the friendship. The element of give and take is important not only in building strong friendship but also in developing the personality of the persons involved because it broadens one\u2019s understanding that in friendship, one should not expect all happiness and good times."
"It seems like today the country is very divided for various reasons. Many people have never faced an unfair police altercation. Many people who are not people of color have never felt what it feels like to be looked down upon or be profiled by authority because of the color or their skin. These people who have never experienced such things cannot allow their sociological imagination to see what the minority is facing; to get into their shoes for a day and see the hardships and unjust treatments they face simply by being of color and walking around a predominantly white neighborhood or fancy store. When we don\u2019t allow ourselves to see life in another perspective, the people suffering don\u2019t receive the sympathy and justice they deserve. Many people fail to see police racially profiling. Many fail to responsibly admit that police are not always right in the way they handle situations and abuse their power of authority. If we can\u2019t get in each other\u2019s shoes, we will remain divided and minorities, especially black men will keep falling to their death under the care of police officers."
"The people in the world that we live in are extremely diverse, in terms of the nationalities, religions, gender classifications and physical abilities. Social workers must have a clear understanding of the consequences of diversity and difference and the mechanisms of oppression and discrimination as they relate to human development. The range of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds that social workers will practice in is huge. Because of this, social workers must have an understanding of the values and attitudes of a multitude of different cultures as well as an understanding of their own attitudes and values towards diversity."
"Most Americans have shunned the extended family setup which encouraged communal responsibility, and have upheld nuclear families which promote individualism. The extended family comprises of the nuclear family and the relatives. This type of family is mostly concerned with building relationships which in turn play a role in the wide community. It is only when people begin to care for each other, the immediate community benefits as well as the whole country. It is therefore important that the Americans embrace extended family and break from their cultural myth of nuclear families."
"The font size I will use is 14. The font I will use is veranda because it is easy to read. The colour text I will use is automatic because it looks professional and it is the easiest colour to read on most paper. I will use word art to make the title look interesting."
"Communication involves a process of several components like a message, the people who communicate and a channel. Thanks to this we can say that communication is dynamic; in other words; it is an ongoing process because, for example, the persons who are communicating are at the same time the receivers and the senders. (Martin & Nakayama. , 2018, pp. 40-41). Since the same message can potentially have more than one meaning, communication involves negotiation and the sharing of the meaning of the words in that message and since communication is receiver-oriented the person who assigns meaning it is the one that determines the outcome of the situation. (Martin & Nakayama. , 2018, pp. 40-41). Communication do not need to be intentional. (Martin & Nakayama. , 2018, p. 41). On the other hand, communication can happen verbally or non-verbally. Both of them communicate meaning and are governed by rules. (Martin & Nakayama. , 2018, p. 174). Verbal means that you use words and the language which is very accurate most of the time."
"In a poem, the structure and topography play an extremely crucial role in the way a readers depicts the writing. Stallworthy has laid out \u201cTwo hands\u201d in one long stanza, with a great deal of enjambment as well. This implies run-on thoughts, as well as providing a tone of overall reminiscence to the text. The lack of a concise structure gives the effect of thoughts being haphazardly thrown onto paper, in whichever order they may occur. Moreover, this style makes it seem like a story is being told. This is useful in depicting the character of the narrator, as well as provides the impression that he is writing a"
"These animals are required to suffer in these conditions daily, this is not humane, and it is a slow and painful death. Holding an innocent animal against their will and torturing them with harmful substances is animal cruelty and should be illegal; there are efficient alternative ways to animal testing."
"Checklist. Checklists are popular, especially where people are working with large groups of children. Many checklists are commercially produced, but it is also possible to design your own. Checklists are easy to use because they focus the observer on particular aspects of child development. The observer either watches as the child is playing or asks the child to do something such as hop on one foot. The observer then notices whether or not the child is able to show the skill."
"During the assassination, there were trained assassins who were told to assassinate Reinhard Heydrich (Tagart). The assassinators failed at assassinating Heydrich but causes him to go to the hospital and he dies there (Herold). The infection on Heydrich\u2019s lower back and legs was what killed him whereas Herold argues that he died in a coma (Washington). Either way, he died in agony (Tagart). The Czech would soon learn that for every action they do, there would be an equal and opposite reaction or, in this case, a positive or negative consequence."
"These parenting styles have a significant impact on children\u2019s psychology. The study of 100 preschool children helped Baumrind to develop the impact of parenting on children. For instance, Authoritarian parenting styles normally result in obedient and respectful children, who are quiet skillful, but they rank lower in happiness and social capability. On the contrary, Authoritative parenting style results in happy and socially capable children. Thirdly, Permissive parenting often results in children who face problems with power and usually show poor and weak performance in school. Lastly, uninvolved parenting styles have the lowest rank among all the categories of parenting. As these children are ignored by the parents so they grow as individuals with less self-control, low self-esteem and are less capable and skilled as compared to their peers."
"But failed to deal with discrimination experience by the travelling community until The 1995 Task Force Report. The denial to recognise this discrimination is evident by An Irish MEP declaring to the Committee of Inquiry into Racism and Xenophobia in 1990 that \u201cIreland is a racially homogeneous country with no ethnic minority groups. As a consequence there are no racial problems of the kind experienced in countries with such groups\u201d The Irish travellers have joined up with other nomadic European groups to demand protection for there common cultures."
"#6 Primary resource: people think that this is a problem and the manure is contaminating the water and making them sick. Which that means this is leading to too much cow manure being applied, which is contaminating the water and people think that it\u2019s going to harm them and making them sick. I have a strong feeling about this because I grew up in a farm, which i feel like people are just trying to get rid of all the farms. But what people don\u2019t realize is that we need farms to live. It\u2019s not contaminating anything you just think that it\u2019s harming your body."
"The facts regarding Diversity and Inclusion comprises of the discrimination of several employees of the organizations based on age, caste, gender, race, etc. but the common issue concerned here is the discrimination of the employees of the organization based on age. The relative ideas in concern of the issue are these employees, are not even offered or considered for the job vacancies, as the leaders do not want to them to be the part of their organization because of their age factor. Many of the Australian firms or the organizations follow the practices of discriminative policies over the age issue of the employees. However, with enforcement of certain laws regarding the job interest of the employees is protected in the organizations. By conducting, more research on the issue and leading to the results about what laws should be implemented in order to eradicate this issue of the concerned organization."
"To sum it up, I would like to borrow the words of C.S. Lewis that says that friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art. It has no survival value;rather is one of those things that give value to its survival. It is unnecessary because friendship comes naturally, it is not forced. It has no survival either because its only residence is a good heart. As I have said friendship is practical, so if we have friends and they don\u2019t act like one don\u2019t mind them. True friends know the value of each one. Friendship does not survive in a lifetime but by the time that you are need by your friend. Friendship is also a way of life. Act as you are but know the value of friendship because according to John 15:13, The greatest love a person can have for his friends is to give his life for them\u201d."
"Duffy takes the ironic figure of Elvis and created a satirical poem. Duffy shows that Elvis and his twin sister are complete opposites in all aspects of their lives; Elvis lived a thoroughly indulgent life, whereas the twin sister leads a simple and happy existence. In the poem Duffy invites the reader to enjoy the feminist view that Elvis\u2019 alter ego is a contented female, living in a community of women. In the last verse of the poem Duffy focuses of the theory that Elvis is still alive, \u2018I\u2019m alive and well\u2019."
"Happiness in the World State can be compared to Soma, as they get all the pleasures of the world without any side effects such as pain and sadness While they do not know the negatives of life to appreciate their happiness, they are still happy, to what they think is the highest degree. Thirdly, everyone in the World State is conditioned to have all the same wants. As a result of their conditioning, everyone is made to want all the same things, and in the World State, everyone gets what they want."
"Preparing my family\u2019s homemade lasagna recipe is not a difficult task, but it is very time consuming. Many people try to rush and throw everything together to have a meal in a timely manner, but the key to success is patience. You must have the patience to cook and put together the dish before baking it. The key to creating my family recipe is to select top-quality ingredients, prepare them, and bake them correctly. By following these directions, your homemade lasagna meal will be a great success for you and whomever. (760)."
"Sethe responds to Paul D\u2019s accusation of her love being too thick that \u2018Thin love ain\u2019t love at all.\u2019(Morrison, 82). This can be also observed in the Sethe-Beloved-Denver dynamic. They consume each other and their love for one another. But Beloved is the one that overgrows them. Beloved and Sethe develop a mutual obsession. Beloved says: \u2018I am not separate from her, here is no place where I stop\u2019, and \u2018You are my face; I am you\u2019 (Morrison, 105). They have lost themselves in each other. Sethe is dominated by her guilt and she tried to replace it with as much love as she can conceive."
"Adults were also consulted but, surprisingly, they failed to indentify the importance of play to children. Accordingly, it could be said that the process provided an admirable example of how consulting with children can yield unexpected and rewarding results. It also proved the importance of listening to children and not just assuming we know what they want, or worse still, what is best for them. It was the children here who identified a gap and contradiction in public policy. The publication of Ready, Steady, Play! provided the first step in closing that gap. The eight objectives consisted of giving children a say in designing play policy; raising an awareness of the importance of play; developing child-friendly"
"Group social workers are typically employed by social service agencies or other non-profits to organize groups, facilitate intergroup or interpersonal communication, and evaluate the effectiveness of an organization\u2019s social service programs. These social workers may also work in private businesses or organizations to identify and suggest tools for constructively managing sources of intergroup conflict or tackling workplace issues."
"That\u2019s when I met her, she was like me, hopelessly misplaced and desperately reading the long lists were they had the names of the students, which were almost falling off the wall where they were stuck because of the moisture that it felt that day. That was when we first spoke and discovered we were in the same classroom."
"It is because of wrongful executions that capital punishment must not be implemented in society. They only create doubts into the minds of the people that they cannot rely on the justice system especially once they badly need it. This is also hard to accept on the part of the families who already had members who experienced a wrongful execution as this is something that has a permanent impact. Obviously, the innocent people wrongfully executed can never be brought back to life anymore. Since the courts cannot be expected to make the best decisions all\u00a0the time with regard to the people who deserve conviction and acquittal, it is difficult to guarantee that wrongful executions can be completely stopped in countries that have death penalty."
"She also appeared in another popular movie called Rodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s Cinderella (1997) playing Fairy Godmother. The movie was also an Emmy- Nominated project! This was such an accomplishment to Whitney Houston\u2019s career and future. Whitney Houston had so much talent, and she is and will always be the queen of music and movies. Marriage and Family is the best thing to look forward to in your later life. On the other hand, Whitney\u2019s story is a bit different. Being married to Bobby Brown was one of Whitney\u2019s biggest downfalls in her life and her career as well. Although Whitney and Bobby had a beautiful baby girl, Whitney didn\u2019t need to be with him. The marriage of Bobby and Whitney led to the use of drugs such as; cocaine and meth. In 2007, Whitney and Bobby finally decided to divorce. Houston admitted about her drug use to Oprah Winfrey. Her fans were looking for a comeback from Whitney in 2009."
"As Richard Dyer points out in his introduction to the BFI monograph, \u201cCoronation Street is the product of the same historical moment as Richard Hoggarts The Uses Of Literacy. \u201d (16)This book was concerned to \u201creveal and legitimise working-class culture\u201d(17) and was influenced by a great degree of \u201cnostalgia. \u201c(18) Similarly, Coronation Street \u201cwhile celebrating and validating aspects of working-class culture and everyday life tended to locate its image of this world in nostalgic terms. \u201d (19)Therefore, it was the illustration of the \u201crecovery of the predominantly white working- class\u201d(20) that was a significant element in its appeal."
"The number of gun deaths is alarming. Over the past decade, on average, more than 33,000 Americans have died from guns. Two third of them were suicides. About 1,300 victims were killed in domestic violence involving guns- 586 cases by accident, 11,000 homicides, and hundred killed by shooting. Mass shootings have become deadlier and seem to happen frequently. From 2000 to 2015 the numbers of shootings have increase more than doubled- there are four out of five incredible deadliest shootings had happened in past five years that shaken American History. Beside that 2017 is the year where most of the mass shootings that had big casualties take place compare to any years (Wall Street Journal).FBI shows that because the mass shootings increasing from the straight line from 2000 then from 2013 the shootings have increased dramatically we can call it as a \u201c rising trend\u201d, where the shooters follow the trend when there are more and more (FBI). The FBI have shown how the mass shootings growing big from 1982 until now in figure 1 and the figure has shown 2017 is the year of mass shootings."
"Lennie was killed by someone who cared about him, George, while Candy had wished to have been the one who had killed his dog. Without his dog Candy was left as lonely because though he still had the others, his dog was the one who was always by his side. It shows that Lennie was truly lonely because when he died though George was shaken he had Slim as a friend to replace Lennie. John Steinbeck uses dreams to show loneliness and isolation. George\u2019s character is used to show this. Although most of the ranch workers like George, he is mentally isolated. This is because of his dream which distances him from the other characters."
"One possible solution is to pass in many school districts is year-round school schedules. The aim with the year-round schools is to have the buildings in use during the summer months, with students on various schedules in order to maximize resources. There are millions of illegal aliens living in the United States. They are working jobs that need to be done, that someone has to do and that many of us would never take. They are still waiting for a change in the system which could regulate their status. Ignoring the problem will only make things worse. These people deserve fair treatment."
"The Orphanage is a horror movie directed by Juan Antonio Bayona and released on Dec 28, 2007. The movie tells the story of a woman who returns back to an orphanage that was once her home with an intension of reopening it for special children. This Spanish horror movie is nearly flawless,creepy and beautifully constructed"
"The second undertaking is to anchor one\u2019s outskirt and to uphold the law for the decent of the people. All countries are qualified for uphold their laws, and everyone should regard the authentic exercise of this right. for instance, \u2018Political specialists, for the commonweal that they\u2019re responsible, could make the activity of the right to move subject to various legitimate conditions, identifying with the obligations of outsiders towards their received nation. Outsiders are committed to regard the texture and religious legacy of the nation that gets them with feeling, to adjust its laws and to help worry about metro concerns\u2019 (Catholic Social Teaching para. 2-3)."
"To be an HR manager, you need to work with all different kinds of people and it is important to know how to speak to them. According to another site I found, \u201ca degree in psychology can help prepare you for this type of career\u2026\u201d (\u201cA Psychology Degree Can Help with Human Resources.\u201d), which later also states that it can open doors to different career paths as well. Learning human behavior is an important part of becoming an HR manager."
"The United States military service is a highly diverse profession. Each branch of the military is made up of people from every walk of life imaginable, creating a mixture of different nationalities, economic situations, and religious backgrounds. These groups come together in order to accomplish a singular mission. However, the military is not the only application of this. Diversity is important because it provides multiple viewpoints that assist with mission success and decision making, and foster a more comfortable and tolerant workplace environment."
"Though organizational diversity was initially understood to mean employment equity, the concept has expanded to incorporate the process of establishing and maintaining a dependable and flexible working environment from a diverse workforce, which can sustain the growth of any organization in this modern world marked with diverse challenges such as, urbanization, global economic recessions, and globalization (Arredondo, 1996)."
"We decided to make a stop in the DC area for lunch. We went to the nearest eatery, a McDonald\u2019s because the temperature had spiked to 100 degrees with high humidity which made walking unbearable. We got back into the vans and decided to continue onward to make our mid-way target to North Carolina."
"During my observation I discovered that most of the children could complete the tasks asked by them. I asked the children to complete a list of simple physical tasks, (i.e. running skipping etc) I asked them to copy what I did and then repeat. I also asked them to play a simple game of \u2018cat and mouse\u2019. I noticed the children could play together with each other displaying feelings of competitiveness and a general display of tact within the game. I.e. Gary and James would be running away from Erica and they would split up and run behind her to escape being captured. The children can work with a great deal of co-ordination. I noticed that the girls were slightly more developed in my observation, more girls than boys could complete the tasks I asked. That is with exception, of using tactics, the boys were more competitive and planed to win using tactics and plans. The girls had a more of a \u201cHandle it as it comes\u201d attitude, a more hands on approach."
"In The Distribution of Distress Mrs. Williams holds a\u00a0mirror to the face of America and shows that although it would be nice to think that race is not an issue anymore it really is an issue, a very big issue at that. The author uses a personal experience of hers to clearly restate the fact. In the process of buying a house, when the bank realized she was black they asked that she put down a bigger down payment than was originally asked for her house. Although she did not have to put down more money it shows that white people discriminate intentionally. Her credit check came back sufficient and they still wanted to charge her more. The bank informed her that it wasn\u2019t race but risk that assisted in their decision. It is a known fact that if a few black families move into what is considered to be an all-white neighborhood, the property value decreases."
"The author states that American Mental Health Counselors Association aids in professional development of counselors with continuing education, standards of practice and research according to the Council for Accreditation of Counseling & Related Educational programs (CACREP), knowledge and skills, post degree and pre licensure issues finally legal and ethical issues (AMHCA, 2013). According to the author (Marriage and Family Therapists (n.d.) \u201cThe counselors association comparison with the American Mental Health Counselors Association developed standards for education, training for Marriage and Family Therapists\u201d. Marital and Family Therapist must have a master\u2019s degree that includes graduate training in marriage and family therapy. The research states that it is also combined with 2 years of managed clinical practice with individuals, couples and families. Training of clinical members is in diagnosis, assessment, and treatment as a variety of uses of therapeutic techniques (Marriage and Family Therapy, (n.d.). According to (American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT, (n.d.)"
"How does Steinbeck present Lennie and George in the 1st chapter? Lennie and George\u2019s father and son like relationship is clearly one of love, although from the beginning we sense George\u2019s frustration due to Lennie\u2019s constant childish behaviour. George is very protective over Lennie, \u201cLennie for God\u2019s sake don\u2019t drink so much!\u201d because he has been told to look after him by his \u201cAunt Clara\u201d. George does like having Lennie around as he says, \u201cNo you stay with me\u201d."
"Steinbeck from the start makes Slim above the other men and this is continuous throughout the whole novel till the end of the story. Slim first major contribution is when George confides in him about how him and Lennie travel round together. Slim is clever in the way he brings this topic up as he says \u2018funny how you an\u2019 him string along together. \u2018 But he says it calmly and invitingly to George, also the tone Slim uses offers confidence to George to talk."
"Furthermore, youth of Chinatown are criticized for their lack of knowledge and understanding of \u201cOld China traditions\u201d (367). Choy also points out how brainwashed they are by the North American lifestyle. Although it is true that he is a banana, Choy realized that he does not belong in either world. Therefore, he tries to find the foundation of his Chinese roots. And his search for his identity led him to write \u201cThe Jade Peony\u201d, which emphasizes his \u201cstruggle between being Chinese and being North American\u201d (637) and discovers that it is a universal feeling. As a result, Choy finds out that people are the same wherever they come from, they are all driven by same principles which is \u201csecurity and happiness\u201d(367). And finally, Choy fully accepted being a \u201cbanana\u201d and is proud of being Chinese."
"The staff member would be acting as an advocate to the child. Staff in school may feel the need of an advocate, they may have issues regarding work that need discussing with the head teacher but may feel intimidated or unable to communicate well. They may use a colleague as an advocate to speak on their behalf. As a member of staff and a parent I have been asked to act as an advocate on behalf of parents. Some parents feel intimidated by their child\u2019s class teacher and not want to raise concerns themselves but will ask other parents working in school to mention things for them."
"The policy that allowed for this mistreatment of my father was known as immigrant screening. Luckily, that is all that my father had received for as my friend\u2019s brother was not so lucky. Hailing from Afghanistan, Zohar\u2019s brother was taken to the airport while on the way to see his grandparents in Afghanistan and was put into a detention facility. He was grabbed by the TSA for the \u201crandom checking\u201d and was then placed into the same room and being asked the same questions. The only vital difference in this situation was that he was a Muslim immigrant from Afghanistan. He was then taken by police enforcers, put into the back of a van, and then transported to a detention facility against his will. His family did not know where he was or when he was to come back home, if at all. Zohar\u2019s brother was soon deported back to Afghanistan. Zohar didn\u2019t know until her brother got to his grandparent\u2019s house that she would never see him again in the United States."
"Social and conventional standards which some of the time appear to be very unfounded assume an essential job in issues identifying with sexual orientation imbalance also. The fight to end oppression ladies still goes on in numerous nations of the world. Shockingly, this fight is appeared to take longer time since it is battled against profoundly established conventions."
"My body temperature wasn\u2019t evenly distributed because my chest and head were not in the water. Only my legs were submerged up to my stomach. I got tired of playing with the water gun and started playing with my battery operated motorized tugboat. I would let it float away from me a bit and then reach out and grab it, pulling it back. But the waves the other kids were making in the water were large and strong, the boat would often get too far away from me and I would have to step down from where I was to get it back."
"Footballers their families and friends regularly suffer from the three forms of racism as set out in this paper covert,institutional and overt racism happen on a regular basis.Poor job prospects for managers and coaches and taunts from players and fans are common place.Fiffa,Uefa and the respective F.A.s are right to acknowledge this problem.However it would appear actions are short in their forth coming and it is nothing more than lip service.Fiffa almost got it right in their 2001 proposals when they said the media and other agencies have a duty to respond to racism.In order to survive clubs are dependant upon the large amount of income that television rights generate."
"Some young couples may begin cohabitating at a very young age and also begin having children before they are married and the abuse begins. For a child can be harmful mentally and somewhat physically. A couple that is not married, but live together with kids, and they both have children that are not each others can also be the cause of domestic violence towards one or the other child. In that child\u2019s environment, he or she thinks that everything in their family is going smooth and all of a sudden the girlfriend gets into a heated argument with the boyfriend or visa-versa and the boyfriend moves out of the house."
"The brain is much more flexible during this time and contains a wider window of opportunity for learning new things. Unlike adults, children do not have to work past the barriers set by their first language. Adults learning a foreign language have to get used to grammatical strategies, letters and characters, and conjugations that are different from their original language. On the other hand, children can learn both languages side by side so that they can take elements from both to help in learning the other."
"He now con-siders \u201chat authority or call I had, to pretend to be judge and executioner upon these men as criminals. (177). If they are men-like-me, a simple biological essentialism will not work. But all-soe wants to own a savage so badly that he even dreams about it (202). The question he is left to struggle with is how to justify enslaving mem-bers of another race in the absence of a simple biological essentialism. Crusoe manages to cut through that Gordian knot by putting forth what might be called a kind of racial essentialism that works diachroni-cally rather than synchronically. The simple form of biological essentialism holds whites and blacks up in a synchronic relation and pronounces whites to have superior capacities."
"Additionally, the speaker appeals to the audience by tapping into the power of reason, emotion, and credibility. The reason, emotion, and credibility focus on the speaker, the argument and the audience respectively; together, it allows a speaker to persuade effectively and powerfully deliver the meaning of their speech (Varpio, 2018). First, the speaker uses appeals based on reason by asking \u201cI am an engineering professor so why would I get involved in this?\u201d (McKeown, 2016). He answers that by re-counting \u201cwhen I was at college in England, I volunteered for Amnesty International and wrote letters on behalf of prisoners of conscience\u201d (McKeown, 2016). On the other hand, the speaker draws out feelings from the audience by arguing that \u201cif you stand up, speak out and say something, even a little something, it could make quite a difference\u201d (McKeown, 2016). Moreover, the speaker appeals to logic by using statistical facts and trends. He argues \u201cthere are 1 million African Americans in prison in America today, six times the rate of whites, but if that trend continues one in three black men born today will go to prison\u201d (McKeown, 2016). Together, these examples become powerful and effective persuasion tools available for the speaker in this situation."
"My first opportunity to volunteer at The University of Nevada, Las Vegas was for The Foundation, which is a nonprofit organization that raises and manages private funds for the benefit of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Their biggest event of the year is the UNLV Foundation Annual Dinner, which is held at the Bellagio Resort. For this event, my duties included making sure that all guest were directed to the correct ballroom and ensuring that every guest was seated at the correct table. The guest speaker for the 2017 event was Dr. Mae Jenison, an engineer, physician, and NASA astronaut who was the first African-American woman to travel in space. I have also helped The Foundation with the \u201cIn the City: UNLV Foundation Suite Deal. This is an event with alumni and friends who support UNLV. Participating in community service often changes the student\u2019s attitudes and their views of diversity (Yoon, 2011). I personally found that from these experiences, my perception about UNLV\u2019s diverse community changed. It furthered my interest in service."
"The people describe a two-dimensional Richard Cory. Throughout the poem, the people simply analyze Richard Cory appearance and do not understand the inner being of Richard Cory. In the poem, the reader is concealed to the instability that Richard Cory encountered that caused his suicide. The reader perceives Richard Cory as an ideal man and is not aware of the difficulties Richard Cory battles internally. After Richard Cory\u2019s suicide the poem ends, but the poem indicates that the people learn from Richard Cory\u2019s death. In the poem, the people realize that Richard Cory\u2019s life was not as fascinating as they expected, the poem states that, \u201cWe thought that he was everything to make us wish that we were in his place\u201d (755). The people believe that Richard Cory is a magnificent man because of his appearance. However, the people never really understand what is going on in the life of Richard Cory; the people did not understand the struggles Richard Cory experiences inside."
"While Rosenblum\u2019s examples summarize the most basic obstacles that have successfully defeated any efforts to formulate comprehensive reforms earlier in the decade, these same rationales have only continued on and remained consistent today, even under a newly elected President in Barack Obama. Given that the 2007 McCain-Kennedy bill marks perhaps the most legitimate effort at achieving comprehensive immigration reform in the 21st century, it seems as though the complexities of the legislative processes and strategic ploys utilized by the field\u2019s major players have successfully prevented any changes to policy approach. However, it is also critical to note that Obama\u2019s legislative agenda became focused with the sudden economic downturn shortly after taking office in 2008, as well as taking on other major legislation in addressing healthcare and insurance reform. The outline of these concerns can also be understood as a list of relatively new constraints upon comprehensive immigration supporters, as there is a distinct contrast in the policy approaches between the 107th-112th congress and those with which preceded it."
"Together we taught each other how to be patient and that we could not always have things we wanted when we wanted it. I also learnt that life is sometimes just not fair and that her sitting in the front seat for two days in a row was just tough luck. And that I needed to think faster and smarter. Teacher relationships like these help provide children with their first peer interactions and the first opportunity to handle the different aspects of long-term and intimate relationships."
"Victims are forced into marriage for many different reasons. In the\u00a0United Kingdom, the Working Group on Forced Marriage found that most cases were a result of \u201cloving manipulation, where parents genuinely felt that they were acting in their children and family\u2019s best interests. \u201d \u00a0To families living in poverty or economic instability, a daughter may be seen as an \u201ceconomic burden\u201d who must be married as soon as possible to take financial strain off of the family. Marriage can also be used to settle a debt, or to strengthen family or caste status through social alliances."
"A child\u2019s mind figures out how to adjust to a not as much as positive condition and this happens to trick the procedure of ordinary improvement. The brains of neglected child are not integrated and this causes challenges in emotional, social, and intellectual advancement. The delicate period, amid the initial two years of life, is a basic time in which mind movement faces extreme psychosocial hardship whenever looked with disregard and is probably not going to be recuperated."
"I do support the Death Penalty. I don\u2019t consider it cruel, why because some people do some things to the point they can be found guilty and they live will be taken. People don\u2019t think about their consequences. \u201c If that was the case, there would be more killings by police than arrests. When murderers are confronted by a policeman, they normally surrender because of the threat of the lethal weapon pointed at them\u201d. I don\u2019t but then i do because some people deserve what they do but i also kinda be feeling sad."
"Janice Galloway\u2019s, \u201cForeign Parts\u201d explores the theme of fractured identity in an original and effective manner. In my SSL I shall explore how structure and characterisation are central in the development of this theme with close reference to the text, showing also, how Janice Galloway engaged my interest in an effective way."
"Donor eggs and donor sperm are selected by the intended parents are implanted in the uterus for the gestational period of 40 weeks. Intended parents and surrogates have to consider what type of surrogacy arrangement they feel like they are comfortable with. There are two common types of arrangements pertaining to surrogacy, which are commercial and altruistic. In commercial surrogacy the surrogate is paid for her time and effort, any travel involved and related medical expenses not covered by insurance."
"Although these descriptions may seem extreme, they are unfortunately not. University Heights is truly an ill-equipped school. It does not have any AP courses, a library or even a cafeteria. It is incapable of giving its students the education they deserve, and has consequently repeatedly failed to prepare many of them for college. On the other hand, Fieldston has been known to go above and beyond the expected to increase its students\u2019 chances of not only getting admitted to prestigious universities, but also succeeding once they get there. As a result, it has had a long-standing reputation of producing many renowned politicians, journalists, and designers who have major impacts on their communities (Joffe Walt). The extent and the effects of inequality in the current education system were not only explored in \u201cThree Miles\u201d, but also analyzed in \u201cThe Problem We All Live With.\u201d In Episode 562, Glass interviewed New York investigative reporter, Nikole Hannah-Jones, to discuss the corruption in America\u2019s system of education. Hannah-Jones pointed out that there is a strong correlation between institutions\u2019 demographics and their quality of education."
"I want to be the part of the show to experience this love among the family. I want to meet the artist who are starring in the show and want to know their opinions about their character they are playing and what all the things they are doing to play their character. I want to about the efforts made by them to make this show more productive and emotional. My favourite character in this show is Manny Delgado, who is the first son of Gloria Pritchett. The reason why I like this character is that he is very benevolent in nature and he has a very kind heart. He has an empathic character. And the beauty of this character is enhanced as Mr. Rico Rodriguez plays him flawlessly. I want to know Mr. Rico Rodriguez whether or not he is same as his character."
"They would also strike\u00a0any person who dared to associate with blacks. This may stand to elaborate why nobody socializes with Crooks \u2013 they\u2019re frightened to step outside of social parameters. For example we learn that, \u2018Candy stops at the door and takes a step back.\u2019 The fact that Crooks is black demolishes the possibilities of his dreams actually being accomplished; they are not assigned the same rights, and In turn dreams as the white people. This is ironic because we know that Crooks used to \u2018live the dream\u2019, and live amongst \u201cthe white kids;\u201d perhaps this is Steinbeck making a comment on how society has regressed for the worse."
"White women were also warned to \u201cwatch out for so and so\u201d, or warned to not go places without being accompanied by elders. If a black male was to be attracted to a white woman, whites in spite of conveying the appropriate message automatically said derogatory and racist remarks. McLaurin caught interest in a girl named Charlotte Humphries who had been a schoolmate of his since the first grade. Blue eyes, blonde hair, having the complexion of a white girl, he was impressed and did not think pursuing wanting to date her would be a problem. However, regardless of his feelings, his mother disagreed and insisted that Charlotte would not be a good idea for him. McLaurin\u2019s grandmother began to explain to him that he \u201cjust shouldn\u2019t\u201d pursue her, mentioning that the story behind it all goes\u00a0back a long time ago. She explained that Charlotte\u2019s great-grandmother was someone who was a \u201cmulatto nigra\u201d. Some mulattos pass as white, even though they are not, if they are light enough and that is what happened with Charlotte\u2019s great-grandmother."
"However, some people say that legal abortions kill babies. They say that millions of babies are killed every year because of abortions. Others also say that it is against Buddhism. In Cambodia, most of the people are Buddhism; therefore, they think that killing a living thing is considered as sin. It means abortion kills baby; and mother will get sin if she aborts her child. These ideas are acceptable and interesting. Besides this, mother will either live in a terrible condition or die because of abortion. But when there is a legal law for abortion, mother will be safe with the taking care from experience doctors or nurses. Meanwhile, legal abortion does not mean to force women to abort their children; in contrast, it helps women how to understand the method to take care of their health and lives. I still strongly support legal abortion because if there is no legal abortion, women can also try to abort the fetus and there are no experts who can help them. Consequently, they will be more dangerous than there is no law for legal abortion. They do it illegally and without any experience; therefore, there are a lot of lives that will die. Legal abortion is not only important for women, but it is also important for the society and the world how to realize its advantages."
"This did not stop my mom, so she waited until she was ovulating and got pregnant, unbeknownst to Michaeli Nine months later, Michael gets a phone call from a Philadelphia hospital saying that his wife was in labori On April 1977, I was born. Soon after, we decided to move to Tennessee They lived there for about a year and a half and then moved back to Georgia, coming full circle. It was here my mom decided to defy her southern morals and leave her husband. Now alone with three children, she moved to Hillsborough, Nonh Carolina. At this point, my brother and sister were 12 and 13 years of age, so this gave my mom a chance to find a good job close to home, She found a job working for the mayor, For the first four years of living in North Carolina we had no car, We had a red flyer wagon that my mom would pull to the store with me in it, getting groceries from the A&P. When I turned 6 years old we got our first car."
"Whether or not abortion should be illegal or not is a very controversial issue. Abortion is a very personal matter and people have many different opinions about it. Reasons for or against an abortion could be rape, money issues, religious views, and or young motherhood. An argument for the prolife side would be that life begins at conception. With that being said some people would consider it murder and an act of taking a life if abortion was chosen."
"Great leaders are made and not born. If anyone have the desire and determination, he or she can become an effective leader. Good leaders create through a ceaseless procedure of self-think about, instruction, preparing, and experience. To motivate their workers into more elevated amounts of cooperation, there are sure things leader must be, know, and, do. It doesn\u2019t easily fall into place; however, they are gained through constant work and study. Great leaders are over and over working and examining to improve their administration abilities; they are not laying on their shrubs. Leadership is a procedure by which an individual impact other to accomplish a goal and coordinates the association such that makes it progressively interconnected and predictable. Leadership is a sorted-out procedure whereby an individual impact a gathering of people to accomplish a shared objective. Leadership practices can be communicated in numerous specific circumstances and at a wide range of social positions. It includes different blends of intensity, for example, coordinating the consideration of others, and the ability/power to control, guide, impact, support or force the conduct and estimations of others."
"Gemstones are minerals that are cut from naturally occurring crystals. Gemstones are minerals that when cut and polished they have beauty of such quality that they command a price. That is what makes the process of producing gems profitable. For them to qualify as a gem, it should be hard and tough to resist scratching and have beautiful clarity. The value is based on rarity and rare quality. Minerals are naturally occurring substances that are solid, have a crystal structure, and have a specific chemical composition. Gemstones may be attractive rocks (combinations of minerals) or specific minerals which have characteristics that are considered desirable to the human eye, such as color, clarity of crystal, and hardness that makes it durable. A gemstone is a mineral but a mineral isn\u2019t always a gemstone."
"In contrast, there are disadvantages that hinder the ability of computers to perform to their full potential and may cause internet users to shy away from regular web use, such as spam and identity theft. In the end, it is evident that by having knowledge of the good and the bad of what one may encounter in cyberspace can enhance one\u2019s ability to surf the internet to their full potential."
"I advised my companions on dietary health, and I told my companions about my four-day diet plan. They all praised me for doing well. This is what they want to do but haven\u2019t done yet. They took a positive attitude towards the proposal. So, with my help, I also made his diet plan. His diet plan is not as detailed as I am. It just says what to eat and what not to eat in a day. He can accept my suggestion that he also hopes to have a healthy life."
"Although police should have the right to turn on and off the camera when they please, police should still wear body cameras because they back up the truth and it would cause them to use less force, which would make the citizens safer. Do you want to be safer than you are now with armed police around?"
"Considering the actual bonding of an individual, there comes a single word in mind and that is of Nikaah. It includes an Aalim (pious person) who performs Nikaah, a Walii (custodian) who is a father representing the person marrying , a bride and a bridegroom. Aalim, after recitation of some verses, asks a bridegroom whether he accepts a girl to whom he is marrying? This same question is asked for three times. A bridegroom should answer clearly, \u201cI have accepted\u201d. Same is the case with the bride, Aalim asks her the same question for three times and she should answer of accepting the man. But in many families the girl do not answer and it considers to be \u201cyes\u201d from her side. And the reason of not answering is considered to be hayaa and shame of a girl in Muslim families. Then after it, the couple give their signature to the written document. And are considered to be husband and wife legally. Allah Almighty regards a couple \u201cthe covering or clothing\u201d for each other. In Holy Qur\u2019an it is stated in Surah Al-Baqarah(187) as;"
"There was a time when his mother caught by \u201cguardia civil\u201d and become a prisoner because she was accused to be a murderer. I think it is one of the starts why Rizal begins to question the government of Spaniards at that time. There are no investigation held at the sight and rashly her mother caught by guards because she is just accused by someone. Rizal\u2019s parents have a majority contribution why is he became a hero, first there is no Jose P. Rizal because of his parents. Rizal Heroism is all because of his parents. Maybe his travels, friends, wisdom, intellectual aspect and everything he discovers while he is growing up and taking his adventures is just a half of share while Jose Rizal exist to become a hero of the Philippines."
"What is offered in love to others be in a subtle manner, without giving feeling of obligation to the receiver. If some help is imparted out of our ego, it may not generate any love for that person. Take care of other person\u2019s worries and find out what makes him/her better. Help in improving self esteem of other person. There are lot of people to find fault if things do not turn out properly. It is our role to make other person feel better against difficulties and odds by enhancing self-esteem and focusing on good things. Do not be quick to point out weakness of a person. This attitude makes other person feel inferior. Take care of sensitivity of a person and make him or her feel better in your company. Subtleness in love is something that is not to be expressed in words but actions speaks of the concern for the other person."
"The affection and care which he received from his mother and aunt have found there exquisite expression in his poems.Her support for her son will never be neglected as it has produced a new era of poetry unlike any other Irish authors or poets. The lesson and knowledge from her mother has repeatedly sent him back to the question of nationalism, compelling him to occupy an uncomfortable place which could neither be accepted nor rejected properly."
"Furthermore, it appears from studies and work by organizations offering support to victims that the incidence of domestic violence is very high in South Africa. Community based studies have revealed that in some areas almost a quarter of women report having being abused in their life times by a current or ex-partner, and that up to a half are affected by emotional or financial (Jewkes et.al, 1999). A survey of 269 women who had contacted helping agencies in three major cities found emotional or physical abuse to be the most prevalent form of domestic violence experienced by women, with 90 percent of the sample having experienced this abuse (Bollen et al, 1999). The Domestic Violence Act (Act 116) was introduced in 1998 with the aim of affording women protection from domestic violence by creating obligations on law enforcement bodies to protect women (victims) as far as is possible."
"The film touches on a host of social problems, including racial inequality, racial profiling, and institutional racism. The film follows a dozen characters as their lives intertwine, and their dissatisfaction with life is exposed. Anthony and Peter are two black men angry at the world for its perceived anti-blackness. Rick Cabot is the district attorney of Los Angeles and his wife, Jean is a high-strung woman filled with contempt for the people who serve her. Two black men, Anthony and Peter, leave a coffee shop and discuss racism in our society."
"Having all of the characteristics I listed can make you a good teacher and can also make it easier for parents to trust you with their children. Some more characteristics an early childhood teacher could have are \u201chigh energy, a desire to learn, and a good sense of humor.\u201d This will show the children and their parents that you enjoy teaching, instead of showing a negative side of you making it seem like you dislike teaching their children. What I have learned about while writing this essay is the benefits people can have while studying for their associates degree to teach young children, all of the things needed to know when a person becomes a teacher and how stressful it can be."
"The white racial frame puts into perspective how every non-white individual in America feels. Frustration, at least, must be a common feeling between all off these people. The worry here is that racism and oppression is so deeply rooted in American history that making it disappear once and for all is well beyond problematic."
"By looking at his appearance and tattoo Jean sees him as a gang banger. She thinks after he leaves from her house he is going to give a copy of her house keys to his gang members and they will come to rob her house. That\u2019s why she asks her husband Rick to get the locks changed again in the morning. Jean stereotyped Daniel based on his appearance. To me Daniel is a good guy, but Jean didn\u2019t think of him as a family man. By looking at his appearance she made her judgment and thought of him as a gang banger but nothing else."
"Due to this, my whole life I always felt I needed to be perfect and in control. For the first half of my life I took care of my triplet brother and sister and my younger brother. However, some of the stress and burden was taken off my shoulders when my mom got better. Then when I was fourteen my alcoholic dad and his girlfriend had my baby brother."
"Since childhood is a human invention there are always disagreements over the \u2018best\u2019 type of childhood but ethnicity and class are easily forgotten. The following essay aims to analyse the contents and boundaries of childhood that have and will change over time and come to some kind of conclusion on the idea of a disappearing childhood."
"It also impacts the society as a whole four million almost a third of children in the UK live in poverty that\u2019s around nine in the average classroom. This number is expected to rise to five million by 2020/21., Almost two thirds of children living in poverty have at least one parent in work."
"By going back to school you can achieve a higher education and get a chance to work with other people that are not like you. A college student is surrounded by a variety of opportunity to learn about just how diverse our country really is. The basic idea is that a student learns a great deal from their interaction in and out of the classroom. A students exposure to the diverse views and the individuals will provide them with a greater personal development and challenge. So if someone is looking for a way to learn more about diversity, either get involved with your child in school, or go back to school yourself. This country needs to get involved with diversity, In the workforce area the company\u2019s have just started to scratch the surface of how having a diverse group of people working for them is by far a benefit and not a hinderance. Society is surrounded by diversity. Our country has embraced the idea of having a \u201cmelting pot\u201d early in our country\u2019s history."
"For instance, if anyone feels down, they would indulge in eating a huge amount of unhealthy food. In their unconscious mind, they are releasing the feeling of depression in eating a lot. Which is completely wrong. We have to be aware of what we fuel our bodies with. Unhealthy food could make us even more depressed. Unlike healthy food which boosts our happiness. So, we have to fuel our bodies with good food in order to be happy."
", which defined as \u201ca state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\u201d by the World Health Organization. Moreover, females\u2019 reproductive and sexual health has a distinct difference compared to the males\u2019. As being said, even in developed countries, pregnancy and childbirth are linked with substantial risks for women with maternal mortality. This happens when new brides are expected to be active in sex and even get pregnant. According to the United Nations, every year, there would be 16 million young girls who give birth, and some would go through compilations during pregnancy and childbirth which happen to be a major cause of death for girls aged 15-19 years old (Child Marriages: 39,000 Every Day \u2013 More than 140 million girls will marry between 2011 and 2020, 2013). According to Carole Presern, this kind of scenarios happen to the young girls due to their lack of knowledge and access about sex and needs, discouraged from using contraceptives, and needing their husbands\u2019 permission. Therefore, it is important for the marriage age to be raised, so that these young girls\u2019 health can be well secured."
"In this essay I take into consideration the term lobolo to refer to the customary token bestowed by the groom on his bride\u2019s family. Similarly, the term bride price denotes the reciprocity between two families; that is, one family gives a daughter and the other gives an aggregate of wealth. In accordance with Bourdillon, I understand the term culture as the enclosure of every aspect that one society calls to mind its dwellers. These aspects, include languages, behaviour, art, music, dancing, knowledge, ways of operating and thinking, values, beliefs, technology, and leisure (7). Moreover, culture is the identity of a paralleled group of people. I also make use of the term marriage to elucidate the act of recognizing and legalizing the marital sexual relationship between a lady and a gentleman. In addition, marriage is a continuous process of knowing and letting the counterpart be what he or she really is. This is a profound sacrifice and commitment to one another in the marriage."

"Relating to the mother-fetus relationship, it is well established that the fetus is dependent on its mother\u2019s body for its survival. Kamm\u2019s first argument is based on the premise that need alone does not confer a right for the fetus to have aid. As Kamm elaborates, \u2018The efforts required in even a normal pregnancy, labor, and delivery are strenuous and risky, not merely inconvenient, and so they extend beyond what a woman is obligated to provide merely because it will save a fetus\u2019s life\u2019 (Kamm, p. 10)."
"In Aissatou\u2019s case, Mawdo\u2019s mother didn\u2019t want a \u2018Toucouleur to marry a goldsmith\u2019s daughter.\u2019 6 In spite of these adversities, both marriages were initially successful. Mawdo ignored his mother and claimed that \u2018marriage was a personal thing.\u20197 He loved Aissatou. Similarly, Ramatoulaye was initially infatuated with Modou. As she reminisces, \u2018But above all, you knew how to be tender. You could fathom every thought, every desire. You knew many undefinable things, which glorified you and sealed our relationship.\u20198 Both couples quickly had children and both Modou and Mawdo did well career wise."
"Are specialized immigrant doctors and immigrants that work in construction viewed equally as immigrants that may be stealing jobs? In a field like construction or landscaping where immigrant employees may be more prominent, are Americans having a challenging time getting a job in that field and that is why there might not be as many native-born citizens? Is it possible that if an immigrant potentially suggests a referral in a company for another immigrant they know could this cause people to think immigrants may be stealing jobs because an immigrant is bringing their friends into that company? If an immigrant dominates a specific job field more than a native-born, does that impact the opinion of immigrants stealing jobs? These may be considered when making an opinion on the global factor of whether immigrants are \u201cstealing\u201d jobs or not. The reflection of \u201cglobal factors\u201d and the examples of evidence bring this to the credibility of the sources mentioned. From the first article \u2018Immigration and Wages,\u2019 the author Heidi Shierholz shows many qualities that support her research to appear credible. She currently works as the chief economist for the United States Department of Labor. She also has worked as a senior economist and director of policy at the Economic Policy Institute. She is known for other notable publications, such as the \u2018ongoing research analysis\u2019 called \u2018The State of Working America\u2019 at Cornell University Press in New York."
"\u201cDream Job\u201d is one of the main focus in almost everyone life that seeking for success in their future. But who could of thought searching was one of the main key players in the search of pursuing the dream career. As we are living in a country with the most advance in the technology, where people able to search and look for their dream career through online search engine with no limited on the information that they can find. But the only concern was which search engine out there in the world wide web that have the capable to narrow down in giving the most up to date and right information that the searchers needed for their career search."
"The earlier, and far more notable, incident was that of Rodney King. When King was going to be pulled over for speeding, he led police on a lengthy car chase and was eventually stopped on a secluded street. King was kicked, hit with nightsticks, and was twice shocked with 50,000 volts of electricity. It was determined that he was struck a total of 54 times. King was taken into custody with 11 skull fractures, a broken cheekbone, a broken ankle and eye socket, kidney damage, and external burns."
"It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of school it is, being told that they must wear a uniform can help or harm a student in learning and affect their social skills. Uniforms should not be enforced in schools, because it may take the uniqueness out of the student, which may lead them to hate going to school. Without having a say in what they wear, it takes away their right to be themselves. Students may think they don\u2019t have to compete with other students or schools when they\u2019re not wearing uniforms and bring more school spirit to the school."
"The second topic that James and I discussed was about his extended family. His only sibling is his brother Jacob who is 43 years old. Jacob is single with no children and is also living in Wilmington, Delaware. His parents on the other hand are a little bit more spread out. His father, Herb (68 years old), lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and his mother, Barb (67 years old), lives in Wilmington, Delaware but not in the same house at James immediate family. His father and mother are divorced but his father is married to Janice (65 years old) and they have 2 daughters, Sarah (30 years old) and Grace (27 years old). His father has one sister and one brother, Hannah and Steve."
"The Author does not shy away from the cruel realities of social deprivation such as poverty in a child\u2019s life and the gruelling consequences. Poverty affects children in all aspects of their lives from low birth weight\u00b7bad housing and\u00b7an unstable family situation (Clark, 2010, p.62). It is truly an eye-opener to learn how many children and their families are suffering with the effects of poverty daily. However, as informative as the statistical information is, one could argue there are too many figures and dates throughout the chapter. Therefore, making it a slightly difficult read. Such as, Government figures claim some success in removing children from poverty with numbers down from 3.4 million in 1998/9 to 2.9 million by 2006/7 (DCSF, (2009) cited in Clark, 2010, p. 62). As a reader, it could be rather confusing trying to grasp the various figures and dates. Although, in contrast, the strong point of this chapter is the clear layout. Each topic such as poverty and community development have large titles that breakdown the information visibly. This chapter would be aimed at those trying to research childhood poverty and help find a solution for social deprivation. Perhaps social workers, various charities and third-level students. Clark effectively highlights how children can play a positive part within their community. According to Nimmo (2008), it is vital that young children are involved within their community and voice their opinions, as many children spend countless hours in an Early year\u2019s environment. Clarks way of thinking is simplistic yet truly thought-provoking."
"Lennie shares the same dream with George but his perspective is different to of that George\u2019s. George wants his own land so he can live with freedom whereas Lennie desires to keep \u201cfurry rabbits\u201d and tend them. As Steinbeck portrays Lennie in this way, so the reader feels sympathy for him, as we would say he has a mental disability but this would have not been recognised at the time of the \u201cAmerican Depression\u201d as people would have considered Lennie as strange. In-addition the dream for Lennie petting \u201cfurry rabbits\u201d on his own farm will provide contentment and security for him."
"One of the first memories I can remember of my mom was her singing our song to me every night before I was going to bed. While traveling through each state I remember us singing this one special song over and over. It calmed me down and relaxed us both. I always find my mom giving to those in need. Either it is giving money to the homeless or it is helping someone in need with a warm bed and a meal. She is always finding new ways to keep busy and show me how big her heart is."
"This quote illustrates that because Othello is a black Moor, hence Brabantio rejects his daughter\u2019s marriage to Othello. It reflects Brabantio\u2019s strong bias against Othello. Also, Brabantio mentions that the intermarriage of Othello and Desdemona violates the natural norms which shows that Brabantio has a negative perspective towards Othello and this contributes to the significant changes of Othello\u2019s identity. Lastly, under the manipulation by Iago, Othello undergoes a remarkable change in his own perception of himself, which leads to his collapse at last. Othello exclaims that:"
"Moving to the next sense section of the essay, the author enhances the text with the facts of his personal life and tells about himself being a boy. He makes an emphasis on the several trades of character, making a man being a criminal aiming to survive in a harsh society. He enhances the text with plenty of adjectives, as severe, ruthless, and cunning. Baldwin managed to render the contrast between the lives of blacks and whites. Moreover, the writer emphasizes that \u201cBecause if I am no what I\u2019ve told I am, then it means that you\u2019re not what you thought you were either!\u201d It is the turning point of the whole message."
"At the end of WWII, soldiers were coming back to their households with the desire for prosperity. With the execution of the G. I expense, many families moved from the cities into the suburban areas. Government paid programs opened up suburbia to growing varieties of middle class Americans, developing safe tasks for blue-collar employees. Suburban areas blossomed into the ideal white neighborhood, where the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d was to be recognized."
"There are several bad apples that get greedy and are cocky at times and think that they cannot be touched if they do wrong. Police departments around the U.S. have several issues with corruption, misconduct, and brutality. Most of\u00a0the time these issues are covered up so that, these officers do not give the departments bad names and people do not trust them and they, are having more crime on their hands instead of defeating the crime."
"Cell phones in our current society are part of our everyday life, but cell phones should only be limited to leisure time and not during school. Cell phones should not be used in school because it is distracting, it is disrespectful to teachers, and can be a tool for students to cheat. Students should learn to become independent from their cell phones just like the days when cell phones were not invented yet."
"Even though Lennie gets on Georges nerves most of the time it is very entertaining to read. First of all, the character George is the one that takes care of Lennie and makes sure that he doesn\u2019t get into any trouble. I know that George sometimes has regret about having Lennie with him, it proves this when George said \u201cIf I was alone I could live so easy."
"Despite the society\u2019s eventual tolerance on racial differences, there are still studies that show that whites do not prefer in places where there are a lot of African Americans thriving in. In a research survey conducted, most of the white Americans who were asked in the survey said they prefer living in a community where the population of African American is less than 30 percent. (Clark) Studies showing the trends of mobility actually show that neighborhoods or communities with relatively high population of Black families have the tendency to have a \u201ccollapsed\u201d\u00a0population of white families (Quillian 1999). This means that white Americans tend to move out the place if it is more dominant of the black Americans. In the long run, these neighborhoods would be dominated fully by black Americans. Perceptions on Crime Empirical studies were never really enough to back up the perception of neighborhoods and communities about crime. There are no really a significant number of studies which focus on the black-on-black crimes. But then there are two main factors that are believed to influence the perception of a neighborhood towards crime."
"Another problem that goes against the legalization of abortions is the fact that life starts right at conceptions, and by having a abortions you are technically killing an human being that has an right to an life. During fertilization of the egg an human is made into existence with an its own identity due to genetics that doesn\u2019t change. So therefore having a abortions you denying an the fetus its right to live. They will also argue from conception to old age that everyone deserves the right to live no matter what."
"We can pick and choose what behaviors and values we would like to follow and the ones we do not want to reciprocate. What we don\u2019t realize is seeing and experiencing the bad can also benefit us in a good way. Children are raised as babies almost always in one environment and one community. The same way children learn to speak from hearing their parents are guardians, is the same way they begin to develop mannerisms and a personality. When a child develops a voice they do not have the same voice as the parents, they develop their own."
"A family business can be defined as an interaction with unclear boundaries between two different but related structures, the company and the family( Family Owned Business 2020). Family businesses may involve several family members combinations in different business positions, including husbands and wives, parents and children, extended families, and multiple generations playing the roles of stockholders, board members, working partners, advisors and employees."
"Manage your time. Time is beneficial and too vital to waste. Time administration can be viewed as a list of rules that involves scheduling, setting goals, planning, developing lists of matters to do and prioritizing. These are the core fundamentals of time administration that be understood to enhance an environment-friendly personal time administration skill. These primary capabilities can be great tuned similarly to encompass the finer factors of every talent that can provide you that extra reserve to make the outcomes you desire."
"Through flashbacks, points on politics and independence are strongly brought out, since the political struggles for independence in Belize at that time also mirrors Beka\u2019s own need for self-rule and her developing maturity. Beka\u2019s father (Bill Lamb) cuts down Beka\u2019s favorite tree (a bougainvillea) as a sign that the wild ways Beka had picked up must stop at once when she finally tells him that she has failed her exam. Her mother (Lilla Lamb) buys her a special book and pen in which she is told to write any lies or stories that she is tempted to tell, in an effort to curb her tale-telling habit."
"In the first place, most of people think death penalty is the ultimate warning for criminals and let criminals know they will be putting to death if they commit crimes. However, does death penalty really works as well as we expected? What is the purpose of death penalty? During our whole lifetime, we grew from a little kid to a young adult, we all made stupid mistakes. In particular, if a kid grows up and murders a person just to get some money from the victim."
"Discrimination against anyone regardless of their needs can make them feel isolated and different to other. Very often adults with special needs have a very difficult time trying to fit in with other. Example: In our setting we promote inclusion and we treat everyone the same and explain to others \u201cwe are alike but different.\u201d"
"Helping emotionally and financially is not important merely, what\u2019s important is to help them become a useful member of the society. Instead of leading whole life dependently, they themselves should become a helping hand for others for bringing deprived ones out of the catastrophes. Secondly, one should always help others in a way without compromising their integrity and self-respect.Rumah Aman is an orphanage Malaysia based organization committed to help children to become useful society members. The organization provides education, food and shelter to the orphans."
"Power has an important role to play in Steinbeck\u2019s \u2018Of Mice and Men\u2019 throughout the whole novel. Power is displayed through authority, wealth, control, strength, and status \u2013 and the quantities of these that each character possesses determines their place in the hierarchy of power in the novel. Curley\u2019s Wife is considered one of the weak ones, because of a lack of some of these attributes."
"High levels of parenting stress and a lack of social support are associated with negative mental health status for ethnic minority adolescent mothers, which in turn negatively impacts the development of their children. It is important to explore unique risks and protective factors associated with positive maternal outcomes for ethnic minority adolescent parents to ensure healthy development for their children."
"But as we know George kills Lennie at the end. Without Lennie, George relinquishes his hope for a different life. Lennie was the only thing that distinguished his life from the lives of other men and gave him a special sense of purpose. With Lennie gone, his hopes cannot be sustained. The grim note on which the story closes on where George and Lennie\u2019s dream first began and ended suggests that dreams have no place in a world filled with such injustice and adversity. As Steinbeck explores the theme of fate and powerlessness."
"It is therefore expected that whereas alcohol is not good for the drunkard, it is also not good for the family of the drinker. It robs them the morally upright person that they looked up to. What might be the various aspects of the family that might be affected by having an alcoholic in the family? According to Cork, (as cited at www. alcoholandfamilies. org), researchers have often shown much concern for the alcoholic, while overlooking his/her family. There was therefore need to determine the various aspects of the family that were affected by having an alcoholic in the family."
"Children (just like adults) are less apt to spend their money when it is cash and when they do not have easy access to it. The best way that I have found to do this is to keep the cash in an envelope or in a jar. Why does this work so well? Kids don\u2019t have immediate access to the money but it is still accessible and you can remind them that they are saving to purchase item \u201cxyz\u201d. This goes really well in having the child set a goal because you can constantly point out to them what they are saving to purchase and they are less apt to spend the money on trivial items. Is this a fool-proof method. No. Kids are human (just like us) and will sometimes want to spend their money on something trivial. Let them! This helps them to learn that sometimes things that we purchase aren\u2019t actually worth the price tag. Do this enough times and your kids will start thinking twice about what to spend their money on \u2013 trust me."
"This worked well as it informed the audience as to why she wasn\u2019t in the next family photograph and why the family started to fall apart. We also used slow motion. Slow motion is when characters in the play act a lot slower than normal. We used this when we showed the car crash. I think it made the performance look more professional, rather than all falling on the floor, we all fell forward in slow motion and the fact that the mother didn\u2019t get up showed her death, I think this worked well. A tableau or a freeze frame is where characters on stage freeze in fixed positions."
"The themes explored in \u2018Remember the Titans\u2019 are strength, unity, courage, brotherhood, pride, trust, over-coming racism, friendship, team bonding, over-coming adversity and change. Each character in the film each had to experience each one of these themes, bettering themselves. Most of the themes occur at once: unity, brotherhood, friendship and team-bonding as most of these occurred either in training or during a game, these themes ultimately happened because each team member wanted to win the season, knowing the only way was to come together and work together as a team. Ultimately this led to having each character overcome the rest of the themes, as it was inevitable."
"I imagine George in two ways at the end of this novel. My wish is that George somehow gets enough money to buy his farm with Candy, and they live the dream. The probable ending is that George continues living, trying to scrape enough money to one day have his farm, but gives up hope, realises the dream will never happen and follows the other men, spending his fifty bucks in the cathouse and drink, to drown his sorrows."
"Snapchat was launched in 2011 with a bright yellow and happy emoticon. This is an app that anyone can download with no cost at all. On the surface, Snapchat is just another way to contact friends and update friends on what users are doing through posting \u201cstories.\u201d More than 158 million people use Snapchat every day to communicate with friends. Once a photo is sent, the receiver has a time limit set by the sender before the photo \u201cself-desrtucts.\u201d Subscribers can send a 1-second expiration to a no expiration photo."
"Obsession with pristine and uninhabited wilderness provided many misconstrued ideas and facts that led to brutal confrontations between those for conservation and preservation and those trying to provide a decent meal for them and their children. unclearThe National Park Service Act of 1916 established the dogma for park management, the chief policy for philosophy, policies and decision-making [15] . And? What do you want to say in this paragraph?"
"So they judge him in a spiteful, uncaring and unfair ways, an example of this is the last line of the book where Carlson says \u2018 now what the hell ya think is eatin\u2019 them two guys?\u2019 after George has just killed his best friend. I know that if I had just done that I would need a shoulder to cry on. Steinbeck shows us that some of the characters \u2013 Crooks and Curley\u2019s wife \u2013 were victims of their age by making Crooks suffer from racism and Curley\u2019s wife suffer from sexism both of which occur but less often."
"How do you think could a person survive alone in this world without support? It might be possible but describing the life of that person, we can use nothing but grey colors and a feeling of despair. The feeling to have a partner is considered normal to every human being. Yet, when it comes to marriage, the greatest dilemma will appear owing to the fact that either marries the one you love or the choice of your family who is the people you loved."
"\u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d is a brilliant novel in demonstrating that prejudice is a tool that people use to become more familiar with other individuals in order to overcome the fear of uncertainty. However, the ending result is that it puts distance between the person and the one they judge because it is not fact, but perception that is completely untrue. Prejudice is simply the reasoning of a fool to make themselves feel secure."
"Not only is this town racist, but it is also filled with sexism, majority of the men and teenage boys do not believe that women are their equals. Mr Robertson will not take advice from Gwen Black (Blacky\u2019s mother) because she is a woman, even if she was a \u201ctactical genius\u201d. \u201cEverybody thought that to be a great coach you had to be a great player. And a bloke, of course,\u201d . Pickles is also sexist, he dislikes Cathy (a camper) squidding with Blacky and himself, he believes that it is a man\u2019s job. \u201cGirls and squid, according to him didn\u2019t go together,\u201d . Blacky\u2019s father is also sexist, he is always down at the pub drinking or going out fishing while his wife Gwen is at home cooking and cleaning for her family."
"In Chapter Thirteen of the book \u201cThe city in History\u201d, Lewis Mumford gave an idea of the main features of an ideal city. In this chapter, Mumford speaks of palatial buildings, museums, art galleries, theaters, hotels, academies, pleasure/amusement gardens, zoological gardens, parks, cathedrals or places for worship, places for producing, selling and consumption and suburban areas for private residences. An ideal city should also have separate traffic streets from pedestrian ways. These above-mentioned features are found in most cities of the world today, specifically the thriving and prosperous ones."
"I know Josh struggled through school because he wanted to fit in with the rest of the class that was hearing. He didn\u2019t want to be treated different than others but he had to be treated special in ways in order to be able to hear the teacher or other students. I don\u2019t ever recall Josh having very many friends in school and I think it maybe because others students were not comfortable being friends with someone who is hard of hearing. As the movie stated, deaf people do not want to be treated differently than hearing people. Deaf people want to let hearing know that they are normal; that they are just like you and me. They do not want to be looked at as being disabled or handicapped. Just because a deaf person cannot hear, it doesn\u2019t make them much different than hearing people. It does not make them mentally retarded like they once were categorized. Rory Osbrink stated in the movie, \u201cYes we may some accommodations that need to be made to survive in a society dominated by hearing people, but at the same time if you would come into a room full of deaf people, then you (hearing people) would need the accommodation too. This quote reminded me and going to my first silent dinner. I was in a room filled with deaf people and I felt like an outsider because I was unable to sign very well and I could have a used a little accommodation. Just like deaf people believe that their deafness is a handicap or disability, they also believe that deafness doesn\u2019t stop them from achieving their goals and dreams. Deaf people have the same careers as hearing, including: lawyers, actors, teachers and even film makers. Their deafness also does not change how they live their lives either. According to the deaf math teacher in the video, he believes that not being able to hear does not keep him from being happy or sad. He does not feel like being deaf is a burden. He has become accustomed to being deaf and accepted it so he feels as if being deaf is normal. The opportunities and successfulness for the deaf however, were much different many years ago (around 1800\u2019s). The possibilities for a deaf person in the 1800\u2019s and into the 1900\u2019s were very slim to none. Being a deaf person was viewed as misfortunate and strongly looked down upon in society. Deaf people were viewed at the level as retardation. No one knew how to deal with deafness and many deaf people chose to live out in the country away from the hearing and were left to themselves. The deaf struggled to communicate with people and it made it very difficult for them to interact and get jobs like a normal hearing person could do. I believe at the time, the only way the deaf could communicate were through home signs because there was no widely used sign language in the United States. I cannot imagine the struggle deaf people had to deal with in those times. They had to have felt almost helpless. There were no schools for deaf and you cannot send a deaf student to school because how would they learn. I am sure it would have been very tough for a hearing parent to have a deaf child and know that their child\u2019s possibilities were very little. The struggles of the deaf would soon be reduced and change the deaf culture forever with the help of a man named Thomas Gallaudet and Alexander Graham Bell. Thomas Gallaudet and Alexander Graham Bell really changed the deaf culture forever. Gallaudet opened the first school for the deaf and established American Sign Language. This was the start of a new revolution in deaf culture and gave the deaf greater possibilities. Alexander Graham Bell also helped improve deaf possibilities like Gallaudet, but some of his ideals like banning sign language in schools I do not agree with. The effort and contributions these men made in the deaf culture brought opportunities to the deaf culture that were once heard of. Sign language and deafness was recognized as culture and sign language was accepted and was acknowledged as a foreign language. A part of this documentary that really stuck out to me is how parents are dealing with their deaf children. Having a deaf child from hearing parents can be very shocking and overwhelming to the parents. Some parents are taking very risky steps to deal with the deafness and that is having cochlear implants giving to their child at very young ages. The problem I have with the situation is that it is very risky for the child and the child does not have a say in the matter. The operation could cause damaging effects for life to the child and it is irreversible. Parents think deafness is the end of the world for their child and they think if that by getting the implants it will solve all the problem, which we learned it will not. The route of education parents choose for their deaf children is also another area that I feel unsure about. We saw some different examples of how hearing parents who have deaf children decide to educate their children. The one example I saw that I liked least was the parents sent them to a school where they learn to lip read and do more things to help the children survive better in the hearing world. I think this will help the students adapt easier to hearing people but they don\u2019t have the opportunity to embrace their deaf culture. The second example which I liked best is the parents sent their child to an all deaf school. The school embraces the deaf culture and the child is able to interact with other deaf students. I loved how the parents wanted to let their son decide if he wanted implants and they would support any decision he made. Watching this video just makes me want to be more involved in deaf culture. I have learned so much and it\u2019s amazing how this video and ASL class has changed my life forever. I will look at deaf people in a new and positive light now, because after all, they are just like you and me."
"Boys start to come into puberty later than girls usually around the age of 13. The physically changes for both boys and girls can cause embarrassment and anxiety. Self-confidence can be affected as young people start to notice their own development and compare themselves to their peers. This important than being with family and feel left out or anxious if they are not doing things with their friendship group and may experience bullying aspects if they are not with peers and rather with family. This pressure through peers is strong and can result in loss of self-esteem and a lack of individuality and self-worth."
"In Amanda\u2019s book \u201cWhy I killed My Best Friend\u201d, Maria who was a young girl has been described. She was lifted from Africa which was her beloved homeland and was later relocated to Greece. The young girl struggles with life as she tries to cope with the transition. She develops hatred for everything in Athens including language, her classmates, school, air and even the food that was offered to her. In the process of resigning from this misery, she meets Anna."
"Rich industrialized countries offer far higher basic salaries than developing and third-world countries. In addition, first-world economies like of America and Australia also have a fixed minimum wage ensuring that even migrant workers from less-developed countries receive a higher basic salary. Migration enables people to relate to new ways of life. It leads to an exchange of knowledge and experience between races or nations It also serves as an opportunity to collaborate with people of other countries to be a multi-racial community and to unite with each other and share their views (Gabriel 2011)."
"For Belfast to become a united city, equality amongst all needs to be tackled. Workers doing the same job should get paid the same regardless of their race or nationality. Social cohesion can bring less violence among others, less crime and people can learn from one another in a cohesive community."
"In mention to the intersection of gender and race, the writers argue that South Asiatic American adult females face ethnicity based favoritism in the wider society and gendered inequality in their ain community ( Mani 1994, cited in Bhatia and Ram 2004 ) . One of the writers on whom this survey was wrote, DasGupta, wrote that turning up as a \u201c brown \u201d miss in a largely white community, she faced the multiple troubles of non being able to achieve to white criterions of beauty, being racialised and besides being perceived as both alien and repressed. She internalised and struggled with being both \u201c ugly \u201d and \u201c alien \u201d ( DasGupta 1998, cited in Bhatia and Ram 2004 ) . Her individuality is constructed through the frequently painful battle, competition and dialogue of these assorted cultural \u201c voices \u201d . The many messages she receives from the outside universe and her ain community make it impossible for an individuality to take form by unifying the best parts of each civilization together ( Bhatia and Ram 2004 ) . Additionally, Bhatia and Ram argue that socialization should non be measured as an accomplishable result but be seen as an on-going procedure. It could be argued from the point of position of selective socialization theory, possibly this individuality formation would hold been smoother if the writer had had a strong cultural community to assist steer her through the hurting of the racism she experienced."
"Global warming is the greatest challenge facing our planet. It is, in fact, the increase in the temperature of the earth\u2019s neon- surface air. It is one of the most current and widely discussed factors. It has far-reaching impact on biodiversity and climatic conditions of the planet. Several current trends clearly demonstrate that global warming is directly impacting on rising sea levels, the melting of ice caps and significant worldwide climate changes. In short, global warming represents a fundamental threat to all living things on earth."
"The Puerto Ricans suffered lees from crack physiologically than socially. This nationality usually served as barrier between the drug sellers and police when resolving criminal issues. The outcome of this situation was definitely unfavorable to general Puerto Ricans. On one side they did not belong to the criminal part of El Barrio (with its multi million dollar turnovers), and on the other side the rest of the New York City perceived them very negatively."
"Sometimes they lack it, thinking that it is not as important as it is. The thing that they\u2019re missing, though, is the chance to revel in the glamor and pride that is given to them by their very nation. This is particularly true in nations that were colonized before, as they are split into wanting to be a part of their colonizer\u2019s identity or forming their own, which in some cases are harder than the former. National Identity can be achieved in ways more than one. There are measures now that can be utilized, most of which can be pushed through with the use of technology: through Audio-visual presentations, radio broadcasts, even television shows."
"Later, he learns that Kendall is not who she says she is when she sets him up in an isolated bus stop to meet Kaplan. This leads to one of most intriguing and suspense filled scene in the whole movie. Thornhill is attacked by a crop duster plane in the middle of nowhere with nowhere to hide. As the movie builds up to the climax, we learn that Kendall is actually an undercover agent who has infiltrated Vandamm\u2019s criminal organization. Agent George Kaplan does not exist. He is only a decoy to distract Vandamm from knowing the real traitor in the organization, as earlier revealed by the professor."
"What has become transparently clear from what has been written about Hamlet is that life in Elsinore castle is, to say the very least, strange or \u2018rotten\u2019. Ophelia has grown up with less than perfect role models and is in a very poor situation. The politics, which hold her in the castle, are intense. Enemies on all sides surround the country of Denmark. As a result both she and the rest of the residents are effectively, appear to be trapped or held within Elsinore. It comes across as being extremely claustrophobic; everyone knows each other private lives it appears."
"\u2018Conyo\u2019 talk is a cultural identification where its speakers can be described as having a profound cultural ambivalence. \u2018Conyo\u2019 speakers use it not spontaneously, like in situations of code switching, but intentionally to demarcate their own space. This type of discourse is clearly used as a strategy to give the impression of being privileged socially and\u00a0economically."
"and inequity. In a system teeming with error, the risk of executing the innocent is authentic. Reform in our death penalty process and procedures is necessary and urgent. It is our provocation to work towards a systematic change that will guarantee fairness and equal access to justice, due process for all persons facing the death penalty."
"Always trying to bring new programs and innovative ideas to the school, during 2016, I was able to work with the church property and grounds committee to establish an infant/toddler playground, which could be used by our infants and toddlers. The toddlers had always used the preschool playground, which was a large space with playground equipment that was actually not appropriate for them and could have been a safety hazard. I was able to get an area fenced in especially for infants and toddlers and ordered equipment and hade it installed for this age group, along with the required mulch that is needed for fall height on all children\u2019s playgrounds. In addition, during the same year, I was able to create brand-new \u201cMommy and Me\u201d classes, which involved finding a space and ensuring that it passed all state and local inspections. The \u201cMommy and Me\u201d classes were held I the school\u2019s gym and this took a lot of coordination and scheduling efforts, ensuring that the teacher was available to teach the classes and ordering equipment such as mats, tunnels, and trampolines to be used with the different age groups. These classes were advertised by using various media formats and proved to be a boost to the overall economy of the school, since many parents who came to the \u201cMommy and Me\u201d classes, later enrolled their child in the school\u2019s toddler or nursery program."
"Outside of the media, I worry about the inequalities the students from 8th and College Connections might face. Many of them do not have a lot of money, but are more than capable of making a difference in the world. They are all intelligent, but they do not get a fair chance to show it. For example, the world\u2019s poor, including those from River Bend are not given access to quality education to develop to their full potential. Paul Farmer discusses this issue: \u2018And so [the poor of Haiti and the United States] and others in their position\u2013globally, this would be hundreds of millions\u2013have fought to construe as a basic human right access to health care, education, and other social services\u2019 (5)."
"This is illustrated with \u201ccarefully turned up his sleeves and slowly washed his useless, perfumed hands\u201d the washing of the hands here is Pilate\u2019s way of trying to forgo responsibility, and hence he is not a real man as he cannot stand up for what is right so therefore Duffy shows how no sympathy should be given to those men with a small supply of masculinity."
"In The Bluest Eye however, the Eurocentric images and influences of the Western God have a lasting negative effect on many of the black characters. There is colour people playing a part in this God\u2019s composition, instead, focus is on the colour blue \u2013 that his eyes are portrayed to be. This colour suggests coldness and blindness towards people not sharing in His whiteness. Pecola Breedlove is the prime character that is influenced by these negative images of God, and the influence of the Western religion\u2019s \u2018values\u2019 shown in the novel pushes her into an unfortunate type of lack of \u2018Self\u2019. This comes about in this novel due to the interactions with white and pseudo-white characters who have subscribed to the idealized notions of white superiority. The first instance of this is Pecola\u2019s encounter with Mr. Yacobowski \u2013 the shopkeeper, who basically ignores her existence because she is black, his attention instead focuses on a picture of the Virgin Mary."
"But in other sovereign state, when they make something, it will be viral and be pursued by other countries, and we\u2019re one of the crowd. While our country, when we do something new, they will criticize it even if they haven\u2019t seen it, and that kind of attitude should be ousted by our fellow law abiding citizen."
"The weather was starting to get windy and the waves were getting very choppy. We were still really far out into the water and exhausted from being out there all day but hell we weren\u2019t going to let a little bad weather ruin our time. Soon after this the waves started turning into rip tides. Rip tides are when the wind and wavesclash together which creates a force stronger than any human swimmer can fight. Sam and I didn\u2019t know that so we were fighting against the waves trying to get to the beach but the more we fought the more we were pulled out into the ocean. I\u00a0was getting exhausted from fighting the waves and I asked Sam please don\u2019t leave me I wont be able to make it into shore without you. I was too tired to keep fighting the waves until we hear a megaphone yelling \u201cDon\u2019t Fight The Waves, Swim Diagonally.\u201d We listened to the lifeguards and started to swim diagonally rather than fight the waves head on. Sam right by my side never even going further than a arms length."
"Lastly, no matter what industries, mostly men are in power positions. There are some reasons for it: \u201cSex stereotyping leads to resistance to women\u2019s leadership\u201d (Experteer Magazine). When women are in a leadership or management position, they are often tagged as selfish, aggressive, deceitful, and abrasive, whereas men are valued as charismatic and enterprising. \u201cAnother thing often heard is that women are not ambitious\u201d (Experteer Magazine). This idea makes people think that women are hard to set and achieve goals. Another reason is the lack of mentors. The senior people are mostly men and they still tend to lead younger colleagues of the same sex. So they are \u201cmore supportive, encouraging, and helpful to young men\u201d (Experteer Magazine). There is only a little space for women to squeeze in. Power positions are men\u2019s league. These negative stereotypes about the work discourage women to stop advancing in their careers."
"This states that the U. S. is losing out to the U. K. in attracting international students (Stenman 2006). Thousands of skilled young South Africans tend to emigrate in search of a better living, thus, draining the country of much-needed economic resources such as manpower. According to BBC News; 100,000 people every year leave South Africa and the 70% that are still in there say they are considering emigrating, despite their government asking them to stay and work in the country. Racism is an act of discrimination or prejudice based on one\u2019s race."
"Martin (2007), states \u201cin general, most people\u2019s attitudes toward the poor and the homeless are negative, and the stigma that has always been associated with poverty seems to increase when the poor become homeless. The reasons for this negative bias are likely related to the public nature of homelessness, where those without permanent homes are forced to live out in the open, such as on the streets, alleyways, parks, or in automobiles where good hygiene is virtually impossible and begging for money and food is often the only means of survival\u201d (The Causes of Homelessness, para. ). This does not include other negative issues associated with being poor; mental illness and substance abuse. It seems that society believes that all homeless people are dirty, crazy, beggars who abuse drugs and alcohol. These people are very dangerous and are unworthy of receiving any kind of help. Society blames the poor for succumbing to poverty having no clue that there could be reasons beyond control, including increase in educational requirements, long-standing institutionalized oppression, discrimination, and a general increase in the complexity of life."
"Additionally, Staples brilliantly implies and thus emphasizes the main idea upon which the solar system of ideas and details presented in his writing revolves around, a truth that the reader expects prior to \ufb01nishing the work, and yet still retains its signi\ufb01cance as a breathtaking realization \u2013 The public is blind to injustices that black people endure as an everyday part of their lives."
"With the Alabama Human Life Act, Alabama is just adding one more obstacle that minorities must overcome. We can take Mexicans and Blacks for example, these population already has a huge disadvantage against white because they are discriminated. Both races are more likely be forced to take unsafe actions because of the inequality. Minorities are a huge part of the lower social-economic group that also may not have insurance and will most likely go to a unsafe form of abortion to hide from the government and avoid having a child they will not be able to support economic wise."
"It is a set norm in society that children should look up to their parents but this situation shows the opposite. This demonstrates betrayal because Nel is embarrassed by the actions of her mother and wants to be nothing like her. Not having that role model makes it harder for younger children to do what\u2019s right or wrong when they get older because there was never really anyone to teach them. Betrayal has lead to the death of man relationships throughout Sula. In most of these broken relationships that ended up dying, men played a factor towards them. Men made it tough women to be close together. Women fail to realize that men having most of the power causes them to disregard each other rather than them working together to make society equal."
"As I often experienced many cultures. My family is well-traveled I have been able to experience a different culture in many areas of the world and not only tourist areas. We can get more information when we traveled somewhere and learned about the food, stories, histories that come with them."
"May 25th. Today\u2019s the day. I woke up a full hour and a half earlier ensuring I appeared perfect. I kindly asked my mom to form my hair into two pigtails, the way my father liked my hair best, and spray a sugary perfume on me. Before heading on to the bus, I kissed my mom on the cheek and told her the words I hadn\u2019t realized brought her tears, \u201cBye mommy see you later! Don\u2019t forget daddy\u2019s coming home today!\u201d And just like that, I walked out the front door ignoring the wounds I had just unintentionally reopened."
"Cultural logic, ethos, and ideology all point to systems or institutions sharing in certain belief patterns such as to project a shared consciousness across a select populace. If one were to extract a pattern using the above three variables as a basis for rhetorical analysis, one would then be in a position to not only detect the effect a given text or document bears on a given audience, but also gauge its efficacy within a given context. \u201cWhy Do People Freak Out About MSG in Chinese Food? | AJ+\u201d, produced by Yara Elmjouie, accesses the stigma, perceptions, misconceptions and attitudes borne by many in the Western world when it comes to Chinese foods containing monosodium glutamate [MSG]."
"Also distasteful or offensive the information carried in a cyber sites is not allowed. All materials that have the potential of inciting hate crimes in societies, materials that encourage political rebellion, or blasphemous material are not allowed also as they are basically offensive in significant manner. If these kinds of materials are found posted on the web their owners are accused of cyber crime. The reason for the restriction of these materials is that they lead to hostilities based on faith, race, etc that the modern world does not have a place for. Harassment is another type of crime that occurs over the net."
"The cause of the breach was said to be due to systemic failure (Otago Daily Times, 2013). This shows that though policies may be put in place, it is not an assurance that they are being followed. A closer look at the effectiveness of these policies and their appropriateness to the setting has to be taken into consideration. Currently the Canterbury District Health Board (CDHB) has a restraint minimisation and safe practice guideline in place. This supports their aim to reduce restraint use and treat restraints as a last resort to protect patients from harm. Nurses can be directed with the guidelines to ensure\u00a0safe practice. (Canterbury District Health Board, 2012) As mentioned earlier, a nurse\u2019s perspective is often looked past. A study by Lai (2007) indicate that at times nurses feel that when it comes to issues on restraints, their \u201cinadequacy and inaccurate knowledge\u201d have always been magnified but rarely is the pressure to \u201cdo what is right\u201d in difficult situations brought up. According to the study, nurses still use restraints despite ambivalence because of fear of responsibility."
"According to Anthony Skillen racism possesses an institutional feature; a statement that presents a strong objection to Garcia (1996)\u2019s views that it is individuals who have intentions, goals and not institutions. Skillen then emphasizes that if we go by Garcia\u2019s (1996) definition, then it means that institutions cannot operate without individuals; and therefore individual intentions are determined by institutions. Individuals determined by institutions include; teaching and going home."
"The text and structure has been adapted so the reader is drawn to it by the pictures and simple layout. It has been made for an audience of aduts who do not know how to read and write very well. The purpose of the text is mostly to make money and entertain the reader, not really to educate or teach the reader. In contrast to the Mail online, the Roald Dahl structure is a spoken interview which can also be listened to and it is written word for word. The fact that the interview is directly from Roald Dahl speech and it is his stream of consciousness makes it much more interesting and real."
"However, IVF is also growing popular among couples without fertility issues. In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found that 7.4 million women in the U.S use infertility technology, but only 6.7 million American women aged 15-44 are reported to be infertile. As popularity of IVF technology grows, so does the amount of embryos held in storage. Many women who completely undergo IVF are left with extra embryos to use for future siblings, or as back-ups if the first cycle fails. These frozen embryos raise a lot of controversy on whether it\u2019s morally suitable to allow potential life to stay in that form."
"As our performance continued, we showed the same character, Katie, in two different lives, one went home to her boyfriend the other had been raped. Ruth\u2019s character of Katie who had received the phone call went home to meet her boyfriend. As she opened the door she was greeted by me on one knee. I took her hand and began proposing, I started saying, \u2018I\u2019ve been thinking about this for a long time now, I want to spend the rest of my life with you\u2026 \u2018 Ruth then clicked her fingers, I froze and she walked towards the audience. Ruth began to say her thoughts out loud saying things like \u2018Is he really going to do this? and generally showing her excitement to the audience that she was about to be engaged. Ruth then returned standing in front of me and clicked. I carried on with proposing, \u2018Katie, will you marry me? \u2018 Here is where we froze, Ruth left the scene but I stayed in the same position. The first Katie, who had been raped, walked in. I acted exactly the same and began to propose, \u2018I\u2019ve been thinking about this for a long time now\u2026 \u2018 Katie walked on by, ignoring me, her boyfriend, muttering quietly, \u2018I don\u2019t want to talk right now\u2019."
"Many regard arranged marriage as a well-established cultural tradition that flourishes in many communities, so a clear distinction should be drawn between forced and arranged marriages. However, in some cases the difference between a forced marriage and an arranged marriage may be purely semantic. In her January 2007 report, \u201cReport of the Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights Aspects of the Victims of Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children,\u201d Sigma Huda states that, \u201c[a] marriage imposed on a woman not by explicit force, but by subjecting her to relentless pressure and/or manipulation, ften by telling her that her refusal of a suitor will harm her family\u2019s standing in the community, can also be understood as forced. \u201d Prevalence Forced and child marriage mainly affects young women and girls, although there are cases of young men and boys being forced to marry\u2014especially if there are concerns about his sexual orientation. Reliable statistics on forced marriage are difficult to compile due to the unofficial and, therefore, undocumented nature of most forced marriages."
"An example of this would be in the episode \u2018Lisa\u2019s Pony\u2019; it could be argued that it is aimed at younger children, especially girls. The episode \u2018Brother, Where Art Thou? \u2018 would be aimed at the older audiences, especially men, but whatever the case it is possible for a variety of age groups to watch and enjoy the programme. The allusions in the show itself prove to the audience that the show is up to date, and it gives the show a sharper angle of realism, which again would attract people to watch the show."
"This program will help parents control their anger problems. It will also help parents avoid issues that trigger anger episodes. Children in gangs have more than likely already become delinquent. The reason I say this is because you usually have to commit a crime or do something delinquent in order to become a member of a gang. I would promote the BDTGP, Bringing Down the Gang Program. The purpose of this program will be to establish free after school activities so juveniles will have something to do before and after school. Another part of this program will be to install metal detectors in schools for safety and precautions. Children who are drug abusers are also considered delinquent."
"Discuss English band Blur\u2019s textual representations of British national identity, and analyse to what extent these representations are ideologically constructed. National Identity has become increasingly problematic to define. Hartley: \u201cThe concept of identity is now often viewed as relying on shared characteristics that are cultural rather than natural/biological. \u201d (Communication, Cultural and Media Studies, The Key Concepts, p101) Thus, the major factors defining identity are the culturally constructed concepts of class, gender and ethnicity."
"Cathy becoming pregnant is the catalyst for change in this story, because as this happens, the family becomes even more involved in their relationship as it almost seems to give them permission to invade the couple\u2019s relationship even more, however the only reason the family become such a large part of their relationship is because it is normal cultural behaviour. The ways in which the story changes contrasts with the other stories because it is more gradual, where as the others have sudden events. In \u2018A Stench of Kerosene\u2019, Manak\u2019s mother brings in a new wife for him to marry."
"Racial prejudice was very common and constantly relevant during apartheid rule. The consequences were enormous for the Black society, who were basically kept in prison on native land. The Whites determined their lives, educated and passed down laws for Blacks. Thus the relationship between the two controversial racial groups in most cases was not very good, because life of a Black native South African was oppressed."
"This is because India is the land of sages and great thinks and reformers who have reached far and wide spreading the true message of god. Their sayings and preaches have been guiding all of us since ages to listen to the voice inside us and lead a meaningful life. The growing impetus of spiritualism in the world was born in India and it has been the flag bearer of all this since ages."
"With education, the schools can teach students to act humane and uphold the golden rule. And so far, as an influential country, we have done little to address these issues. In society, we see public figures fall guilty to the use of racism. Public figures are intended to set a good example for others for students, therefore it should be appalling when they In an article by the New York Times, author Melanye Price, discusses Governor Northam\u2019s silence on racism. Recently, reporters challenged Governor Northam after they discovered a picture of him in his 1984 college yearbook, where he is pictured with black face (Black face was makeup that makes a white person look like a black person). next to another person in a Ku Klux Klan Robe. With reporters actively pressuring him for an explanation, the governor has failed to clear up the issue by admitting his past actions were immoral."
"Another example of this is St.Georges market; the market attracts various ethnic communities. All walks of life interact under one roof looking for different types of food, for example, \u201cWe sell to people from all communities, but lots of Chinese people come looking for the ducks, while immigrants from east Europe want the lamb for meatballs and mousakka etc.\u201d"
"The predominant point of view- Interestingly, although this narrator could tell us everything that everyone is thinking, feeling and imagining, the storyteller chooses not to. We are given a peek into only one character\u2019s consciousness, and even then only once, when Lennie is in hiding by the river and imagines his Aunt Clara and a large, hallucinatory rabbit. This deliberate withholding of insider information was probably a result of Steinbeck\u2019s intention to have the story be more of a play than a novella."
"Environment Families who feel confident about their future income and finances can choose their lifestyle. They can also choose where they would like to live. Families in the higher social classes tend to live in more expensive housing areas with good facilities for travel and education. Families with lower incomes tend to live in more densely occupied housing areas. Different social class groups often live in different neighbor hoods, but there can be disadvantages to living in poor-quality or high-density. Housing. These can include noise, pollution, overcrowding, poor access to shops and other facilities. Task 1. Areas of their development may be affected for example, if a child or young person does not talk to anyone or even only speaks a few words compared to others, this may cause concern. This would socially affect the child or young person\u2019s because they would find it hard to make friends, work in groups or even interact with adults. It would also affect their communicational development because they would find it hard to speak to people and also may find it hard to listen to instructions. Responding to a concern like this has to be done in a professional manner, this means that you should not talk to the parent/career or the child."
"In \u201cAn Indian Story\u201d by Roger Jack is an example of family solidarity and care giving within a minority family. When Jack was just a young boy, his mother died, then his father remarried and started a new family that made the boy uncomfortable with his living situation. After that, he decided to go living with his late mother\u2019s sister, Aunt Greta."
"Further, discrimination is seen at work place where some jobs could not be done by an African-American but instead they were reserved for the whites. This is seen when Troy manages to secure a job with a garbage collecting firm and he is heard asking Mr. Rand; who he refers to as the boss, why black men were not allowed to drive garbage trucks. This shows that indeed there was race discrimination at work place where African-Americans could not be bestowed with some responsibilities. The act of being denied an opportunity to drive a garbage truck can be seen as a sarcastic event."
"It is important to mention that gestational age was not related to language functionality in full-term infants rather in preterm infants. It is evident that cocaine exposure to infants born preterm had more malformations and medical conditions. A sample was taken from African American infants that lived in inner-city neighborhoods. Groups studied in these areas had many detrimental factors to where they lived environmentally and how they developed."
"In Like manner, Aristotle fancied that there were three forms of friendship, namely, \u2018utility based,\u2019 \u2018pleasure based\u2019 and \u2018complete\u2019 or \u2018perfect\u2019 friendship. The final form a friendship may take what other may call \u2018true\u2019 friendship. Now, every companionship starts of as either a utility based on, i.e. classmates, or a pleasure based one which in most cases is based on a mutual interest. This cannot be truer in an era where promiscuity runs rampant and fandoms are more easily accessible with the help of the internet. Thus, Aristotle\u2019s distinction of the different types of comradeship may give us a clue to why Mr Holmes and Dr Watson\u2019s companionship is still going strong. Some even argue that it can all be boiled down to their friendship being a model we wish to reflect ourselves in or simply that we all seek to find a \u2018true\u2019 friend in life. Someone we can see as \u2018a second self.\u2019 (Cercio. 2018: 36)"
"The newest forms of execution are Lethal Injection where a lethal poison is injected into the prisoners arm or the Gas Chamber where the prisoner is placed in a room with Sodium Cyanide crystals and left to die. (Meltser, 1973, 21-26) There are four major issues in the capital punishment debate, the first being deterrence. A major purpose of criminal punishment is to deter future criminal conduct. The deterrence theory suggests that a rational person will avoid criminal behavior if the severity of the punishment outweigh the benefits of the illegal conduct. It is believed that fear of death deters people from committing crimes. Most criminals would think twice before committing murder if they knew their own lives was at stake."
"Abortion is murder. The embryo is a person from the moment of conception. According to Shettles, \u201cScientists identify the first moment of human life as that instant when a sperm cell unites with an ovum or egg cell\u201d (18). Most pro-choice supporters do not believe the fetus is a person until the first or second trimester. Pro-choice people do not think abortion is murder because they consider the aborted fetus a mass or cells or tissue (Shettles 20)."
"Now nonverbal communication is another thing. Nonverbal communication is defined as \u201ccommunication through means other than a language like a posture, eye movement, facial expressions, gestures or silence.\u201d (Martin & Nakayama. , 2018, pp. 39, 173). This type of communication can reflect anxiety, depression, worried or even can predict if we are laying; which in some cultures are considered a crime and this is because the meaning of this kind of communication can vary across cultures and contexts. We can also add that since nonverbal communication act in the subconscious because of this sometimes is linked to the real truth. There is no doubt that communication plays an important role in our lives but also helps us develop a sense of identity. In our book the authors exposed that \u201cIdentity arises when communication messages are exchanges between person.\u201d (Martin & Nakayama. , 2018, p. p.96)."
"For instance the lines explaining what happened to Alkanni include verbs such as \u2018beat him\u2019 and \u2018stuffed him\u2019. The uses of these verbs elucidate how inhumanely they were treated. Following this, the phrase \u2018waiting jeep\u2019 proves that Alkanni\u2019s arrest was premediated as they had a vehicle waiting to take her away. The second stanza appears even more threatening, heightening the reader\u2019s sympathy. Osundare describes that they \u201cbooted the whole house awake\u201d, meaning that the whole household was violently shaken awake. The use of harsh verbs such as \u2018shook\u2019 and \u2018booted\u2019 convey the aggression and make the incident sound calamitous and frantic."
"I believe that at the beginning and the end of people\u2019s life\u2019s we should respect them by giving them the chance to live and sense God\u2019s world and what he has planned for us. We owe it to them to give them the basic human right to live and we owe it to ourselves."
"products. Many women and men from various ethnic backgrounds use these types of stuff to get their skin lighter cause there not happy with their self or how they look. So, colorism is solely based on skin color other things like eyes and certain feature would be considered featurism. People are taught colorism growing up at a young age unconsciously and then they don\u2019t discern the effects it has on their culture, because then it\u2019s normalized. In other countries besides the United States, colorism is more related to class levels in society the lighter they (people) are the closer you are to the ideal standard. Even though European colonialism has indeed left a mark worldwide, colorism is said to predate contact in places in Asia and Latin America in both places they also use bleaching cream to convert to society ideal beauty standards. This is a form of self-hate, changing yourself for the benefit of others due to colorism and insecurity."
"Friends are one of the pleasures of life and spending time with them can make the person happy. Yet, no one can spend all of their time with their friends because they have work and responsibilities. Even in their free time, many people find it tiresome to spend a lot of time with their friends. There are types of people, however, who cannot spend a minute alone and they should always be with someone, especially friends. Personally, I find solitude more inspiring and peaceful although I am a social person and have a lot of friends."
"This assignment is going to provide an accurate explanation of the health and development checks for a mother and baby from conception until the baby is one year old. The first check is a pregnancy test. There are two different types of pregnancy test, a urine test and a blood test. A urine test can be bought from most shops and can be done at home. There are two types of pregnancy test, digital pregnancy tests which will either say pregnant or not pregnant and non-digital pregnancy tests which use lines."
"All the living things that Lennie pets have resulted in the death of them such as mice and the puppy. This gives the reader the impression that Curley\u2019s wife could end up meeting death whilst the unaware Lennie. This is a perfect example to show how innocent one\u2019s desires can lead to such catastrophic events. In-comparison, George realises the difficulty of making his dream come true to share with Lennie."
"As brain drain become a global problem so international organizations should address the preservation of the intellectual property of a nation, including health profession. These organizations international organizations, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, the United Nations Development Programmed, the World Bank, the World Medical Association, and the Council of International Organizations of Medical Societies. A global perspective, agreed ethical principles between countries, and a systematic approach using the convening power of international organizations should be the way to address the problem of brain drain."
"Predominantly, the study used a purposive sampling technique focusing on the inhabitants those are poor in the study. Using purposive sampling technique, 200 poor households were selected as a respondent, the researcher believes that these subjects are fit for the research compared to other individuals again because of time, money and workforce the researcher forced to use this sampling technique."
"Technology brings a big contribution to the changes of courtship. Traditional dating is seen as obsolete and might offend female according to males. Telephone calls to ask a woman on a date are being replaced with tweets, personal message in facebook and texting to avoid hurtful rejections. First date is usually the time when you know and check the background of your partner- to-be but it became unnecessary when facebook and google are there for you to know his/her information."
"The more it is displaced from its exact place, thing emerge from within consequently.Need by need by need into its haleSap-wood and bark: coin and pin and nailCame streaming from it like a comet \u2013 tailNew minted and dissolved. (Heaney)Here, need is being driven by need itself- causing to uplift subsequently the sap-wood after the bark. What else is coming out the earth? \u2013 Coin, pin, nail and they come up like a comet tail. All these aspects have a common significance of communication, as these aspects/ elements bridges a gap between two oppositional objects- for a reason to perform. Coin is used as a communication to but things of sometimes to preserve/ collect history which is also one sorts of communication between past and present. Pin, whereas, helped to keep things together at a right place- two different things are attached together. It could also perform the role of weaver to establish a shape in the form of art. Then comes a nail- which is used to hold things properly."
"Racism is one of the most common issues in humanity. It haunts our past and can degrade our future. Many people on earth don\u2019t know what causes racism, yet most of us are racist. To give racism a smaller effect we need to find the causes and fix them. These are six of many causes of racism."
"The other person in the novel to have an alleged caring relationship is Candy The old swamper, aging and left with only one hand as the result of an accident, worries that the boss will soon decide he is useless and demand that he leave the ranch. Candy has a dog, once an impressive sheep herder but now toothless, foul smelling, and rheumatic through age. He was very proud of his dog, it was \u201cThe best damn sheepdog I ever seen\u201d page 45. The dog just shuffles through the day barely existing too ill to eat even, yet, Candy still keeps him alive when it would be a kindness to have had him put down years ago and spared the dog the pain and suffering he now felt. It is a needful relationship in as much as the dog needs caring for and feeding etc and Candy needs something or someone in his life and in this case the dog is it, the dog can hear whatever Candy says but cannot have a conversation with him, he can nuzzle Candy and follow him around offering what form of love and attention a dog can, but he cannot substitute for another human being."
"The learning insight of the film symbolizes the nature of having the idea of reflection from our past activities. The characters in the play emphasized the importance of relating our present and past experiences to our character. The moral of getting away from obligation indicates that we are having a despicable way of determining the social awareness of the society regarding the influence of maintaining a sense of responsibility in our actions. There are rules in life that everyone must have to obey so that we show others how we discipline ourselves with the existing rules to improve our professional standards. I recommend the film to other audiences due to its relative way of presenting how important rules are to our personal and professional lifestyle (Foster, n.p.)."
"The structure of the story is ironic in the way Steinbeck uses descriptive language with smell, colour, light and sound, at the beginning and end. But the circumstances that Lennie and George find themselves in at the beginning and the end is of total opposite. This gives the reader a feel of inevitability to life and that the revolution of Lennie and George was one of insignificance, that we are no more fortunate than mice and nature and man has something in common."
"I remember one thing what my father asked me to remember all the time is \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone tell you what you can or can\u2019t do.\u201d And I always remember this thing when I\u2019m suffering from hard time I love him a lot. \u201cBut who I am with you, is who I really want to be. You\u2019re so good for me. When I am holding you, it\u2019s like I have the world in my hands. Yeah a better man is who I am with you.\u201d Quoted from the popular Chris Young song \u201cWho I am with you\u201d. The concept of love has been transformed into the idea that out of the billions of people on the planet, But for me my family has been the reason for love. Said individual is supposed to possess the ability to change the personality and actions of another human being purely based on the overwhelming affection they hold."
"Bourgois was swept into the area drug economy because of the abundance of information from the dealers and their families who all lived within the immediate area. Most of the accounts given in the book come from a single crack house near Bourgois tenement. The group of crack dealers filtered through Bourgois presents a compelling argument that reform within the economy needs to take place in order to reduce the amount of violence within the inner-cities of the United States. Bourgois states that there is a strong feeling of community among the people living in El Barrio."
"The flow of illegal immigrants to the US has steadily risen since the end of World War II. Consequently, the proportion of immigrants in the entire population between 1960 and 2000 has more than increased. Since this era also coincided with a fourfold increase in violent crime and a doubling of rates of property crime, it may not be surprising that Americans hold powerful views on the effect of immigration on crime. Immigrants have entered the United States either through the frontier with Mexico, the Pacific Ocean, or through many other ways."
"Before the following analysis of the book, Macleod briefly expresses his astonishment at the true harshness of social inequality. He says \u201cIt is more entrenched in the United States than he thought\u201d. However, many of the men succeed in becoming something more than they began as. They are now working class and some may even be middle class. They don\u2019t go as far as they\u2019d hoped but they do make significant progressive improvement from the 1980\u2019s, 1990\u2019s to the 2000s. Macleod mentions that when he discusses the outcomes of the men with his friend Isaac who read the book and grew up in Emerson Heights, he was shocked and unhappy because he feels that the brothers are far more capable than their outcomes suggest. He says that many of them were academically gifted (talented) and intelligent. Macleod comes to the conclusion that individual agency is severely inferior to social conditions and structural constraints. The truth of their outcomes has more to do with their social surroundings. That is where the patterns and true meanings of their outcomes lies."
"For new standards of statistical calculations\u00a0most importantly to my mind, it called for a mandatory proficiency test \u2013 that the laboratories that are doing this work should be subjected regularly to blind proficiency testing, to insure that they did the work well on a regular basis. It is in some sense appalling that there are no mandatory standards for something as important as forensic testing. There are higher standards, indeed for the laboratory practices of someone who will diagnose strep throat than for the laboratory practice of someone who will create a DNA fingerprint that could be used to send someone to Death Row."
"Nash perceives this hostility that emerged powerfully after the revolution, as an inherent supremacist attitude and racism. While slavery was in itself a cruel and even barbaric practice that deprived the other race of freedom and dignity, the hostility that followed the liberation of the blacks was in itself a proof of the inherent ideological racism that permeated the white communities."
"Another piece of evidence in favor of God\u2019s existence would be the universal standard of right and wrong. The fact that the vast majority of us are virtuous beings that don\u2019t spend our days conspiring evil, is good evidence that there is a God, and that God is good. In the world we live in, right and wrong mean something. Even if we disagree as to what right or wrong is, that doesn\u2019t eliminate the category. Our people may disagree with whether it is right to have abortions, allow same-sex marriage, or authorize animal testing. But when it comes to basic human rights, it is agreed upon many that some moral standards are absolute."
"Woman in today\u2019s world have many opportunities that women didn\u2019t have in the 1950s. Men never trusted their wives with money because they were not educated enough, yet inconsistently, it was untraditional for a woman to receive as good of an education. The fact that a woman was even attending college was paranormal. Most women were married after high school and fell into their traditional roles right away. For women to be respected now, a woman has to be a career woman balancing both children and a job. In fact, stay at home moms now receive the same degrading look as educated working women did in the 50\u2019s. It was seen as only right and proper that the wife should keep the home running smoothly, making it a quit haven of peace and joy for her husband, the breadwinner. \u201d (A Woman\u2019s Role in the 1950s\u201d). Her role in the marriage was simply not considered to be on the same level as his. Absolutely, the troubles of running a home were never to be openly compared with a man\u2019s daily travails. He earns money, she didn\u2019t; therefore, his work was important. We don\u2019t want to believe any woman, even half a century ago, was willing to submit herself to a life of servitude in order to be considered successful at her most important role in life."
"The potential of social workers to shift from child protection to child welfare practice would show how social workers respond to child care problems (CCPs). Hayes and Spratt (2009) examined the potential of social workers from child protection to child welfare practice orientation and related child care problems. Social service trusts have usually responded to social policy goals to balance the protection of children and meeting welfare needs through reducing child protection investigations. Social workers tend to address perceived child protection risks and tend to balance social policing and supportive functions in practice as given in Every Child Matters (Chief Secretary to the Treasury, 2003)"
"Last but not least, Patricia believe that equality and respect should be given to women and she taught Trevor that which I side her with that. Patricia will constantly remind Trevor on being respectful to women and treat them with love as she herself is a feminist and feel the urge of teach him that. It can be seen in the book ,Trevor was lectured by his mom on how to treat a woman right. He stated, \u201c I\u2019d walk through the house on the way to my room and say, \u201cHey, Mom\u201d without glancing up. She\u2019d say, \u201cNo, Trevor! You look at me. You acknowledge me. Show me that I exist to you, because the way you treat me is the way you will treat your woman. Women like to be noticed. Come and acknowledge me and let me know that you see me. Don\u2019t just see me when you need something.\u201d (78 ) Her mom was dedicated to teach him right because she wanted him to be a gentleman and most importantly have an open mindset and to not stick with the traditional believe in women at that time. I believe it is important for Patricia to teach him that because she wants and hopes for an environment or society that wipe out gender imbalance so boys and girls are equal in terms of status and power as they grow up. She also wants him to learn to be grateful for women.Which I agree to that because if a boy can\u2019t learn to respect the women who works hard all day to take care of him, I would have doubts in him whether is he capable of feeling there\u2019s anything wrong with jeering or harassing a stranger? Parents should all follow Patricia example and teach their children to respect women. The world will not change for women until we make changes on how men are educated growing up."
"If another person lacks that responsibility, and uses something to harm you, such as a weapon, you should be able to defend yourself, even with a gun. Think about how well it went in the 1920\u2019s when the prohibition happened and alcohol was made illegal, people still got alcohol through the black market, and because of that demand, the black market grew. The same is true today with the ban on drugs, they are illegal, but people can still get them, and people still use them. The same thing is going to happen, only with guns."
"She grew up in a \u2018boys world\u2019. She has three older brothers. Joseph, Michael and Paul. \u201cI\u2019m close to Michael and Paul, we\u2019ve always been. Joey kind of distant himself from all of us\u201d, she pauses for a second, \u201che likes to hangout with my step family\u201d. This brought up the conversation of her step family. Her dad (my grandfather) got remarried and married the stereotypical evil stepmother. She treated my mom horribly. There was two extra bedrooms upstairs but made my mom sleep in the basement. Before I could even continue to ask more about how horrible she was, she interrupted me, playfully slammed the table, \u201cShe would literally label food. Scott (the step-family) and Alvich (my mom). I got store brand food and they got name brand food. (Key Food vs. Skippy Peanut Butter). Get the picture?\u201d We both laughed, it\u2019s so stupid to even think that\u2019s normal. Years later he ended up moving to Florida with Evil Stepmother, and missed out on a lot."
"First of all the Friar has to help Romeo escape. He allows Romeo to spend one night with Juliet, but before dawn he must leave. It is at this time that Juliet has been told to marry Paris. So she goes to the Friar. Friar Lawrence then devises a plan that will ensure Juliet and Romeo\u2019s happiness. In some ways this shows us the Friars cunning, we are also shown that he is quite a smart man. We know that the friar is also an apothecary, so he gives Juliet a potion, which will make Juliet look as if she is dead."
"The reason why there is a big gap between US education academic system with China and India is because US emphasize on maintaining freedoms for the students, and sometimes the freedoms would make people become lazy and slow because there is no pressure or enforcement at all. So China and Indian created an educational system to defeat US students in way of academic progresses and students\u2019 performances."
"Scientists have closely observed sea levels rising at unprecedented rates. A valid reason why sea levels are rising is because warming of sea water and the melting of continental ice ex. glaciers. According to some scientists, they have observed that the \u201cglobal sea level had risen 17 centimeters in the last century )John Church and Neil White( This is a lot more compared to the century before that."
"Eddie opted to take photographs of murderers and crime scenes. Was this a sign of a loss of self-respect as well? Both of these jobs caused him to continue to lose respect for others because he was able to see the scum and horrible things people could commit every day. Through exploring these two characters, I was able to question one big idea, that is, do the two concepts of self-respect and respect for others play hand in hand? If someone loses respect for others, will they lose respect for themselves and vice versa? I have personal experience with these questions and it only adds to my affirmation that this is true. Eddie lost respect for his father and in turn, lost respect for himself as well as everyone else he acquainted with."
"People often say no all children are different. This statement makes sense because everyone is made different. Everyone wanted me to behave just like my older siblings. I would always hear \u201cyour brothers and don\u2019t behaves this way or they will never do the things you are doing; or even, they will not say that so you shouldn\u2019t either\u201d."
"However George feels like he has a burden on his shoulders and has to take care of someone who doesn\u2019t have the same mental ability like him. So, for him it feels like a job rather than a partner or a friend that will give him courage and hope in the future. His dream about his farm is his attempt to breaking the loneliness in his world. \u201cGuys like us that work on ranches are the loneliest guys in the world. They got no family. They don\u2019t belong to no place\u201d, \u201cI seen the guys that go around on the ranches alone\u201d by these two quotes Steinbeck suggests that the ranch itself is a lonely place and with that the characters are lonely themselves which builds up the isolation."
"The Puerto Rican group also struggles in the United States. They have an unemployment rate of 8. 1%. This is the highest unemployment rate of the Hispanic groups. They live below the poverty level by 25. 8%. In 2000, they had a Median Family income of $31,312. This is $23,594 less than the Non-Hispanic White. Puerto Ricans have a strong Catholic religion and family is a high priority. The development of their children is very important. Both parents take the important role in raising their children. There is also co-parenting."
"Both of these studies are valid as the research supports the theory and the results can be applied to everyday life. The Tajfel study shows how people at school in the playground group and pick the group they have the most in common with and communicate with them and if they do not seem to have anything in common they would not stay there. The second study by Howarth can also be applied in everyday life as people create social identity all the time, if a place is thought of negatively by people who do not live their then the people who do can make a social identity and be happy and have positive thoughts about this area and not agree with the others."
"In one scene he defends his father\u2019s actions but shortly after he is angry with his father for putting the family in such dire conditions (i. e. constantly having to move, poverty stricken, etc. ). Sarty\u2019s true test of loyalty comes at the end of the story when it becomes clear that Abner will be burning the landlord\u2019s barn down after the incident with the rug. Sarty is enraged, but the guilt never subsides. For a short period of time, Sarty is actually an accomplice to his father\u2019s actions by running to the stable and getting the oil to use to set the fire; this he does in the name of loyalty."
"In this context we can point out another Moroccan proverb that says \u201cclose you doors is much better than you implicate you neighbours\u201d. Which implies that it\u2019s better for you to take your preventative measures and insure your property, than to disregard it and lose it, and after that you begin implicating everybody that he takes it, and as an outcome of that you\u2019ll not benefit anything, and you\u2019ll lose both your home and your social relationships? So, offering advice by utilizing sayings could be extremely useful, influential and stunning in the exact same time."
"The novel The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian is about a young boy named Arnold Spirit aka Junior who was raised on a reservation near Spokane, Washington. Junior lives a poor lifestyle and was born with multiple medical problems, making it harder to accept himself since he was always getting bullied by other kids on the reservation. That is until he decides to switch to a high achieving school attended by wealthy white kids, called Reardon. This is the decision that really put Junior\u2019s future in a new perspective when realizing he did not want to follow in everyone else\u2019s footsteps on the reservation who didn\u2019t change lifestyle."
"To speak in the Language of the Centurion, I say unto one, go, and he goeth; and to another, come and he cometh; and to my Servant, do this, and he doeth it. In short, Sir, I look upon my Family as a Patriarchal Sovereignty, in which I am my self both King and Priest (1). Joseph Addison took anything life happened to throw at him and managed to twist it into a delightful essay or haunting poem. Though his life was filled with disappointments, both in his personal life and in his political career, Addison managed to produce numerous essays and poems as well as a book and to top it all off, he co-produced three separate periodicals along with his friend Richard Steele. His writing hints at the contextual influences all around him."
"He talks of how when you support people you end up killing their initiative. \u2018A dog you feed will not hunt. If you want a dog who hunts, you have to let him get hungry. \u2018 This is a negative view of Roosevelt and does not really apply to our interpretations apart from slightly applying to the second interpretation. It does support the view that it made, \u2018people dependent on the government. \u2018 We can see from this that four sources agree with interpretation A, five sources agree with interpretation B and the remaining two sources don\u2019t agree with either and this is all to varying extents of course."
"\u201d Even if their was a viewer instead of a reader whatching the film, they would not concentrate on what is happening on the screen but would try to listen for the \u2018bang\u2019 of the gunshot, as I experienced it whilst whatching the motion picture. The decimation of candy\u2019s dog is like a premonition to what happens to Lennie in the final part of the story. All this fuss about the dog\u2019s shooting is what makes the story more hair rising."
"In demography migration is defined as mechanical movement of population between two different territories, therefore, external immigration could be specified as moving from one\u2019s own country to another. Intense global migration did not used to be very common; however, these days it has become an unquestionably frequent phenomenon. As many issues are attached, there are numerous both disadvantages and advantages of this reality. To begin with, there is a variety of reasons which motivates people to leave their native country. The most common is a desire for a better financial position. Furthermore, different factors might be, for instance, natural disasters, education or political issues. Since there are many immigrants who cross the country\u2019s borders illegally, the major complication is undoubtedly their legality."
"Some laws, such as, the 1975 Education of All Handicapped Children Act, which protected the rights of students with disabilities by meeting their needs and improving their educational outcomes (EAHCA, 1975). This doesn\u2019t come without the effortless work families put in for advocating their exceptional children\u2019s rights. This chapter outlines the history of special education; it more specifically provides a timeline of events, when congress started to pass laws regarding the treatment of children with Special Learning Disabilities. These individuals were placed in mental institutes, left to have basic needs but where not granted educational resources or teachings that could potentially be productive members in society."
"She refused. She would never ever make that error once again. Amanda Todd composed that during the next Christmas break, cops notified her at four am that the image was flowing the Web. Amanda composed that she experienced stress and anxiety, anxiety, and panic disorder since of this. Her household transferred to a brand-new house, where she later mentioned that she started using drugs and alcohol."
"Mary Tyrone, a once beautiful girl who dreamed about becoming a nun or perhaps a pianist, has become terribly unsatisfied with the turn of events of her life and the person she has become, tries to flee the self proclaimed world of evils she is living in mainly through her morphine use. She blames her addiction to morphine on the stinginess of her husband, who hired a slip-shod doctor to prescribe her pain killers for the pain giving birth had caused her."
"According to her, Islamic women\u2019s rights are solely governed by the slavery system. Even marriage is a form of slavery for Islamic women by being a slave for her own husband whose duty is to serve and do whatever her husband requires her to do. A woman may only have one husband and has no power of having a divorce, unlike men who can have four wives and has the right of divorce."
"Each of these qualities or characteristics reflects the family identity (Friesen, J, 1990). Rituals are one of those things that make a family different from all the other families in the world; every family has a certain ritual or belief that they hang onto which also gets carried on throughout their generations of the family. A ritual does not have to be something that is based on one\u2019s culture, a ritual can be something like having movie night every Friday of the month and everyone just sitting together and relaxing as family; a ritual can be as simple as that. Change can also how a families identity is, because in the place where they are known, they have a reputation that they have to live up to kind of and in a new place they have to build that again, which is an example of change like moving to a different place. Change can also be something like a divorce which is huge in a family; it can change many things throughout all the relationships that had been made already."
"Children must have their rights protected, but should also learn about their responsibilities to others. Respect can be promoted informally through your everyday contact with groups of children and young people. Our own attitudes and actions will provide a model for children, so it is important that we demonstrate consideration and fairness in all our interactions. Culture can have many diff erent meanings and the way the term is used has changed over time. Culture can cut across nationality and religions. It is what gives groups of people in our society their identity."
"Marriott\u2019s management believes that they are active in the U. S. national dialogue on work and life issues, and lends their expertise to help other employers develop supportive initiatives. Marriott is a founding partner of Corporate Voices for Working Families (CVWF), a nonprofit, non-partisan business membership organization that seeks to improve the lives of working families by developing, and advancing public policies that reflect collaboration among the private sector, government and other stakeholders (Marriott International, 2009)."
"According to psychological research, children are less sensitive to pain and suffering of others or even to the world around them. More so, they tend to act aggressively and would harm others without any worry. The more children are exposed to violence, the more they become less bothered to violence in real life. Children, who watch violent shows are likely to disobey, are rude and in most cases they keep on harassing their mates. (Tristani, 2002)"
"Consequently, Hemmingway validates the element of time by his most repeated lines \u201cfive minutes\u201d which is very much related to measuring an event that is taking place.\u00a0 The author\u2019s powerful use of time makes the narrative more real and to the reader, an event that can really happen in reality."
"It is almost unheard of to have the idea, 1960\u2019s, type of lifestyle these days. It was very common for the woman to be the homemaker and the caregiver for the children during this time while the man worked and provided for his family. Now, it is almost forced upon most families to have a middle class lifestyle or above in order to live a comfortable life."
"She was very pretty and simple, and her face was sweet and young. Now her rouged cheeks and her reddened lips made her seem alive and sleeping very lightly. The curls, tiny little sausages, were spread on the hay behind her head, and her lips were parted. As happens sometimes, a moment settled and hovered and remained for much more than a moment. And sound stopped and movement stopped for much, much more than a moment. \u201d From this passage, the reader can acknowledge the real Curley\u2019s wife but at the same time feel sorry for her as her dream was unfulfilled."
"Prolonged exposure can led to the child to feel endangered in their own home. To many children, home is far from the idealized safe haven from the outside world. Children who are exposed to violence in the home are denied their right to a safe and stable environment. They feel powerless with no one to turn to, which in turn provokes the desire to escape the environment. The children\u2019s strong desire from a violent environment surfaces a new problem. In many cases, girls make an effort to escape from an abusive caretaker but unfortunately end up trapped into an abusive relationship. They remain in this cycle of violent behavior with no means of finding a way out. Ornduff and Monahan conducted a survey which revealed that the children felt more secure and happier in the shelters than they did in their violent homes where they were constantly placed under stressed.\u00a0 Those children who were able to seek help from trusted adults were able to find a place where they can call home, away from the unwanted stress that comes with living in an abusive household."
"The development of this inability to cope is hinted upon, by the following line \u201cMy dream-milk burned in my breasts\u201d. The use of the metaphors \u201cdream\u201d and \u201cburned\u201d by Duffy, symbolizes Mrs Midas\u2019 passionate desire to have a child and tend to it, however she realize that this desire of bearing a child will be nothing short of a fantasy now. Some critics make the arguement that Duffy also plays a pun on the word \u201cburned\u201d here, with the second meaning referring to her growing bitterness towards her husband for his selfish actions."
"Global warming is the rise in the average temperature of Earth\u2019s atmosphere and oceans since the late 19th century and its projected continuation. Many people across the country have been convinced that global warming is affecting us more and more with each passing day. Because of numerous campaigns by the likes of famous politicians such as Al Gore, the common citizen has been convinced that drastic action needs to be taken in order to stop global warming. However, contrary to popular belief, a large number of distinguished scientists and engineers do not agree that drastic actions on global warming are needed."
"They also have abortion services along with many others. Going along with what they provide, Amy gave some facts about Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortion services. Abortion is a very controversial subject with Planned Parenthood. A fact about this business is that only 3% of Planned Parenthoods services provided are actually abortions."
"However, in South Sudan 82% of women and 81% of men agreed that domestic violence against women \u2018should be tolerated in order to keep the family together\u2019. While domestic violence is illegal, it is socially accepted that a man discipline his wife and they are rarely charged with it as a crime. Women are expected to take the role as the care taker of the household. The conflict has increased these reproductive responsibilities of women which has further limited their access to education and other activities. The second leading reason girls do not go to school is due to increased care work. They bare the role of providing food and sanitized water for the household. They are expected to care for children, the elderly, and the sick."
"So, I managed to persuade my parents who luckily respected my choice, and I went to another city, where I spent fabulous four years in college and met my best friend in life ever. My college years is the period in which my character and identity started to take shape. Being away from my family and having the opportunity to live and make decisions on my own made all the difference. The fourth stage is Identity Achievement; the status in which the adolescent has gone through a identity crisis and has made a commitment to a sense of identity that he or she has chosen (Learning Theories Knowledgebase, 2009)."
"Throughout history, men and women stand on two different spectra. While, a typical man is described as masculine, aggressive, reliable, and independence. Woman is supposed to be feminine, caring, nurturance, and compassion. Women are viewed as the lower class compared to men. As according to Ridgway, in Western societies, gender status beliefs are widely held cultural beliefs that view one gender as generally superior and obliquely more capable than the other (Ridgway 525). This means that traditionally men would view as superior to women because they are strong and sociality, in turn, favor men as the breadwinner of the family."
"Highly suited to the physically demanding lives of laborers, farmhands and rural lifestyles generally, it is now a contributing factor to obesity, heart disease, and diabetes in a population that has become increasingly more urban and sedentary. As a result, more health-conscious African-Americans are using alternative methods of preparation, eschewing trans fats in favor of natural vegetable oils and substituting smoked turkey for fatback and other, cured pork products; limiting the amount of refined sugar in desserts; and emphasizing the consumption of more fruits and vegetables than animal protein."
"Positive thinking, confidence sentiments of being in charge, fulfilling work, practical desires an active mien, physical wellness and wellbeing, companions, a great marriage, and religious confidence. Myers recommends that pretending an attractive attribute is a decent method to secure it saying moves toward becoming accepting as making a cursory effort triggers feeling, and acting ends up regular conduct. Two mental standards develop here that joy is in respect to earlier close to home understanding despite the fact that cash doesn\u2019t purchase satisfaction getting a raise brings a brief flood of delight as one encounters a relative enhancement that joy is in respect to social experience correlations with those having less cash, achievement, knowledge, esteem, or favorable luck will in general deliver joy while correlations with those having a greater amount of these prized credits will in general create despondency."
"However, Tupac is focusing on the changes that can be done to make the world a better place, hence the name of the song, changes. Tupac is giving his audience hope that better days are to come and the world will change for the better. In which many songs in today\u2019s society reflect against issues such as brutality, similarly today\u2019s music world and social problems.Black Nationalism and police brutality are still around and are reflected in rap culture in today\u2019s society. Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Philando Castile, and many more, all victims of brutality. Due to all the brutality and innocent lives that were taken, the movement, \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d was born. Many rappers have joined the movement and released songs to also support the movement. Singer Beyonce Knowles and her husband, rap artist Jay-Z, are proud supporters of Black Lives Matter and they are not afraid to make that a known fact. Not too long ago, Jay-Z released a song called, \u201cSpiritual,\u201d that he wrote addressing police brutality. When released he wrote: \u201cI made this song a year ago, I never got to finish it. Punch (TDE) told me I should drop it when Mike Brown died, and sadly I told him, \u201cthis issue will always be relevant.\u201dI am hurt that I knew his death wouldn\u2019t be the last\u00b7I am saddened and disappointed in THIS America \u2013 we should be further along.WE ARE NOT\u00b7\u201dJay-Z is using his social platform in society to get a message across to the American people. Jay-Z released the song in response to the murder of Philando Castile, who, according to CNN, was killed by a police officer at a traffic stop. Jay-Z is staying that America is staying stagnant and even though America should be making progress from racism, it is not. He is raising awareness and also give the people hope through music.Similarly, Rap artist, The Game, decided to take the issue to his Instagram, in which he has 7.4 million followers, telling his fans to join and support Black Lives Matter. He also organized a peaceful protest to \u201creintroduce the Los Angeles police department\u201d to the community, along with hip-hop artists,"
"The ways the reader of this short story can distinguish Friend\u2019s character to be the devil is by noticing through the story Friend has trouble standing in his boots. Surely, Friend, like Satan has Goat leg, Clearly that is why he cannot stand in his boots. Exploring this further, The words scribed on Friends car\u201cMAN THE FLYING SAUCER\u201d indeed has the same letters that spells out \u201cHESATANLUCIFER\u201d . \u201d Through it all, however, she privately harbors innocent dreams of ideal love. One day, while home alone, she is approached by a strange man ominously named Arnold Friend, who is determined to seduce her and take her away."
"Babies will react by grasping something that touches the palm of their hand and if startled will push their arms outwards and clenching their fists. This reflex is normally seen if a baby is startled by a loud noise or a bright light. When held upright so their feet are touching the floor a baby at this age will take stepping movements as a reflex movement rather than conscious stepping. Within their first month babies development changes dramatically. They have usually developed into a pattern with most of their time sleeping but starting to spend more mime awake."
"Secondly, their mother pretends she is not hungry in order for her boys to have enough to eat. This is shown when Michael states, \u201cShe quickly reheated and served what remained of yesterday\u2019s lentil stew, and when Francis said, \u2018You\u2019re hardly leaving any for yourself,\u2019 she claimed she wasn\u2019t hungry\u201d (119)."
"His plan consists mainly of taking revenge from the man who took away the most precious thing he has, his wealth. That man of course is Ferneze, the governor of Malta. So, Barabbas decides to kill Ferneze\u2019s son, Lodowick, that way taking the revenge he so passionately seeks. Once again he uses his own daughter as decoy, to execute his plan, showing that she has mainly a functional purpose for him. After he completes his plan and kills not only Lodowick but also Mathias, the man that his daughter loves, he feels betrayed by his daughter, as she converts to Christianity."
"Being the breadwinner of the family, \u201cmen seek a higher-paying job with more authority to reinforce their sense of masculinity\u201d (Schilt 387). This illustrates that men see themselves higher than women and in continuing to prove their superiority they do things that the norm consider masculine to prove their place in society."
"The effects of harsh discipline include aggression, non-compliance, externalizations, anxiety, and anti-sociality (Landsford, Deater-Deckard, Dodge, Bates, Pettit, 2004). To show these connections we will look at exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, self-ratings, naturalistic observations, and correlational methods (Mohammed & Samak, 2017). The intent of this review is to examine the effect of harsh discipline on the child-parent relationship, determine how discipline shapes a child\u2019s behavior, and to consider the three types of discipline styles and how they will influence a child\u2019s behavior."
"Though nurses are trying to keep patients safe by applying physical restraints, these restraints are more harmful. Scherder et al (2010) view restraint use as detrimental to a dementia patient\u2019s cognition and physical activity. They emphasize that using physical restraints on dementia patients causes more harm than good. Keeping dementia patients on restraints reduce physical mobility, increase patient\u2019s stress, and even accelerate incontinence. (Scherder, Bogen, Eggermont, Hamers, & Swaab, 2010) A study in Israel by Natan et al (2010) 120 nurses were used as samples. 67.2% of these nurses admitted to having had restrained a patient over the past year. Some decision-making factors that nurses point at are subjective norms, the resident\u2019s physical state, and the nurse\u2019s own stress level."
"In conclusion, racism was regarded as a significant and very present issue in the 1950s, than it is today, in London. Racism took place everywhere. This restricted careers and diminished dreams of all the coloured people inhabiting the city. To Sir With Love, is an autobiographical text, which truly reflects on the racial atmosphere of cosmopolitan London."
"I feel there is pressure put on Slim throughout this scene when both parties of Candy and Carlson turn to him for advice and he has takes time over his decision and thinks it through show that he looks at everyone\u2019s aspect in depth and decides what\u2019s best and this is as reason why ranch hands look too him for advice. I think Slim does not really wanted be involved as it says \u2018he seemed to shake himself free for speech\u2019."
"Another form of social learning can be explained through the theory differential association (Sutherland, 1939; 1947, Sutherland & Cressey, 1970; 1974). Although differential association theory is frequently defined as a sociological theory, differential association theory has clear links with social learning theory. Differential association theory not only describes the necessary social conditions to produce crime, but also attempts to explain the processes by which the individual becomes criminal."
"The advent of the internet and social media means that a simple \u201chashtag\u201d can connect hundreds or even thousands of people Claudette\u2019s story would have had the potential to go viral within minutes had a such a scenario played out today Claudette bravely stood up for what she believed in and was a pioneer in the fight for racial equality. However, her story went largely unnoticed, She was deemed unworthy of attention by a few and was largely unheard of by the many She had a voice, but no audience In this social media age, everyone has a voice that can reach across the globe within minutes, Racial injustice can no longer be ignored or swept under the proverbial rug."
"Similarly people of limited means stick together and form friendships. However there are some exceptions, especially in more open society of today where there are friendships formed across classes due to similarity in personality or social activities. Society is more likely to expect that people from higher classes would partake in activities like theatre and go to exclusive parties. It is seen where today, especially in Jamaica, regardless of status, social activities are open to any and everyone."
"Roman Catholic belief that life begins at conception is supported by this reference. There is no discussion on when life begins and therefore abortion is always wrong. B.Harinng says in his book \u2018Medical Ethics\u2019 that \u201cat the moment of conception unique genetic code is fixed.\u201d And therefore a human life is formed."
"He stated, \u201cI feel that because Ray Rice is a talented athlete, the NFL overlooked the incident. The Ravens had suspended the viewer from seeing the video. The Ravens and money has the power to change a person\u2019s story. In this situation\u2013 with the right amount of money\u2013 any problem can go away.\u201d Believe or not, there have been many cases of this happening, but did it specifically happen for this one? And you would think that someone would want to do something to help end such negativity in the NFL program. Do they? NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, held a press conference on Friday, September 19 about the new NFL Domestic Violence Policy that had been instituted since August 28th. The first offense is a 6-game suspension. The second offense is a lifetime ban. It\u2019s harsh, but it\u2019s very much needed. For those on the inside and outside that have actually watched the conference take place and had listened to what he had to say, especially on Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson (beat his kids with branches of trees), people noticed that all Goodell did was \u201csmooth it over\u201d and never actually bettered the problem. Many \u2013even current and former players of the NFL \u2013thought that Goodell just wasted his time talking."
"Thus, Beloved has challenged Paul D\u2019s manhood by taking away his power and making him a \u201cragdoll.\u201d Moreover, this situation employs the gothic element of the oppression of females by males. Though not a female character, Paul D embodies a gothic female as a \u201cvictim,\u201d helpless and passive, whereas Beloved embodies a more masculine character through her aggression and dominance. Morrison\u2019s use of the gothic element of oppression of female characters enhances Paul D\u2019s struggle with his loss of manhood (and thus identity) through the underscoring of his masculinity by placing him in a traditionally more feminine role."
"My grandfather is someone who you can say is selfless due to how he always puts others before himself. My grandfather tries to help out family, friends, and complete strangers before he helps himself \u2013 even if it ends up hurting him in the end. With the addition of his great sense of responsibility, my grandfather is extremely reliable and can always be counted on. Due to such traits, I find that many people, be it, relatives or strangers, take advantage of my grandfather in order to satisfy their needs. Using his inability to refuse favors and his capabilities, my grandfather is found more often than not, helping others with their goals rather than his own."
"Within the Island this idea was evident as the islanders were not willing to undergo this process and therefore rejected change. Despite this concept relating to the island and UNICEF it is not as applicable to \u201caway\u201d as the means for change are very different. Within Away, the key trigger for the change is the new insight and the reflection of one\u2019s self, however this is a notion that is less relevant to the other text as there factors for change were more external."
"When a child witnesses a murder or sees a dead body his or her life is shattered by the experience. Their perception of the world being filled with safety, kindness, and meanings is now altered. Some began to believe that there life has no meaning, and that they are not safe. They have to deal with this traumatic tragedy on their own. When the murder victim is a parent who has been murdered in front of the adolescent, or found by the child the result is devastating."
"A post colonialist discourse could just as easily scapegoat white men, with the inevitable consequence of presenting either brown men or brown women as the saviors. Spivak thinks that Freud (as both a positive and a negative example, since he himself didn\u2019t always avoid scapegoating) can aid us to keep the \u201csentence\u201d open, to explore the dynamics of the unfolding human relationships without foreclosing narratives by assigning determinate roles. She remains leery of any attempt to fix and celebrate the subaltern\u2019s istinctive voice by claims that the subaltern occupies the position of victim, abjected other, scapegoat, savior, and so on. The critic must remain attentive to the fluidity of possible relations and actions. Spivak\u2019s discussion of Freud is offered not \u201cas a solution\u201d but \u201cin acknowledgment of these dangers\u201d of interpreting and representing the other. Neither Freud nor Spivak is silent. They each make various determinate claims and."
"The last but not the least chapter deals with the particular issues that the multiculturalism brought along in the recent times and outlines the vision of the future development of multiculturalism in France. 1 Definitions and different points of view on multiculturalism in the world Multiculturalism is one of today`s most important and intensely debated terms within and outside the academic community."
"1). With such great offer, one could really not resist the temptation to move to another country and most of them became professionals and American citizens (Garchitorena, p. 1). This has resulted to a further problem which is called the \u201cbrain drain\u201d (quotation supplied) (Garchitorena, p. 1). Immigrants were viewed otherwise. The fact that they leave the country as professionals does not assure them that they will land in a field of their expertise. In an article regarding migration that appeared in the Microsoft\u00ae Encarta\u00ae 2006 [CD], the following sentences are to be noted:"
"In this paper, we will be discussing about stereotyping and social identity theory and its effect on Hy Dairies Inc., a Midwestern company which manufactures milk produces, whose sales has increased compared to the past due to the marketing campaign conducted by a women of color. Perceptual error, its causes and its type would also be discussed. The type of perceptual error, i.e. halo effect and generalization, which has affected the company, would also be evaluated. We would be discussing about the effects of misperception in the organization."
"Multiculturalism also set a ground for students to give recognition in the works of other people especially in the field of literature. The development of the influence of multicultural literature exposes students to become more understanding in the diversified forms of lifestyle outside America, which means that although there are no firsthand accounts with the actual events, the students are given the idea of how other cultures work, which in a greater scale could contribute to the knowledge of the students of where and how things have originated (Lowe, 2000)."
"The entire circumstance is quite hysterical. The next motif that is effectively applied is literal wordplay . In the scene where Erotium and Sosicles first meet and she as well mistakes his identity for Menaechmus literal wordplay is used in a very smart-aleck way. When Sosicles attempts to explain to her that he has never step foot into the country until then and had come on a ship she asks him what he meant by ship. To this he responds with a very literal description of what a boat is."
"In addition to the supernatural elements presented in the first scene, Claudius displays two contradictions which represent how the characters of the play have contributed to the unbalance of the natural order; firstly, he speaks of King Hamlet\u2019s death as a \u201cgreen\u201d memory, which is a contradiction in that green is associated with growth and the development of nature, which is the complete opposite of death. Secondly he attempts to create the image of happiness in order to shade the sadness of King Hamlet\u2019s death with the news of his marriage to Gertrude."
"After miss Linda\u2019s class, I ran as if a tiger was chasing me to catch up with my friend Rylie. Rylie is another one of my friends that I have known for two years and one thing everyone knows about her is that her parents are the most strict in the neighborhood and they tend to put too much stress on her and also she has the voice of an angle."
"\u201cPersonal boundaries are guidelines, rules or limits that a person creates to identify reasonable, safe and permissible ways for other people to behave towards them and how they will respond when someone passes those limits. They are built out of a mix of conclusions, beliefs, opinions, attitudes, past experiences and social learning.\u201d (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_boundaries)."
"The Coca-Cola Company endeavors for a complete culture that\u2019s characterized by using our seven core values: administration, energy, astuteness, collaboration, development, quality, and accountability. Each day we work to bring these values to existence through our differing conditions working surroundings strategy. This process comprises programs to draw in, hold, and create different abilities, grant guide frameworks for bunches with differing foundations, and instruct all companions so that we grasp the aptitudes to gain affordable growth. Coca-Cola characterizes variations as: related to people, esteeming contrasts, and representing our customers and the markets where we do trade. Our differing characteristics approach is centered on the 4Cs: a center on driving utilization, cultivating commitment, building a lifestyle that values exclusive viewpoints, and advancing potential communication and mutual understanding. These are the corporate diversity statements on their websites."
"Tweed was notorious for many things, one was his nose, and the other was kickbacks. A kickback is a term referred to the money the political machine received for granting contracts to real estate and other projects. The machine will give out a contract, for example a building or bridge. The government will donate money they raise by raising taxes to have the project finished. As a favor returned for the contract, the company who received the contract must give money to the political machine. The machine also takes advantage of the immigrants by giving free bread to immigrants, and giving them jobs for votes to ensure their power."
"In every student\u2019s course work, community service is considered crucial as it gives the student a clearer picture of the outside world. Community service calls for volunteer works where we help those who need help for example homes for the aged, children homes, hospitals and schools in slums. Participating in community service not only makes a difference to the organization and people being served, but also makes a difference to every student\u2019s career prospects. Participating in community service activities helps to enhance student resumes by allowing students to obtain work-related skills prior to graduation, builds good references for employers in regards to community involvement, and provides a forum to network with future potential employers."
"One of the most powerful examples of unity was in a letter from Richard Lee to Arthur lee 24 February, 1774. \u201c\u2026all N. America is now most firmly united and as firmly resolved to defend their liberties ad infinitum against every\u00a0power on Earth that may attempt to take them away\u2026\u201d (Lee,1). Richard Lee is sure that the colonies will fight to the end. He talks about the extraordinary unity of the colonists. The drawing in the Pennsylvania Gazette By Benjamin Franklin in 1754 also show unity in action. Franklin\u2019s drawing told the colonists that they must come together as one to defeat the British. This cartoon was an influence in the colonies. After 1754, it is proven that the colonies do come together and that this cartoon was a real influence on the colonies. Another example of influence was in a letter from Mather Byles. He wrote:"
"\u201cLike Mexicans\u201d is a short story in which Gary Soto is constantly being reminded that he should marry his own kind. His own kind being one of Mexican descent, and of poverty and refraining from others, especially \u201cOkies\u201d as his grandmother used to always say. Soto ends up marrying a Japanese woman, not a Mexican. But he still has to deal with his internal struggle and acceptance of this choice. One cannot be looked down upon for questioning oneself and the decisions one makes, especially when it comes to marrying after being raised in a household that reinforced the belief , \u201cMarry Your Own\u201d."
"Simon Gittany was sentenced to three years periodic detention until August 2004/ charged with drugs supply. Once Gittany was released from prison Gittany become involved with more honest pursuits in life. Gittany Started a women\u2019s shoe importation business, that ran the website ShoeCandy. It is then he decided to move in with fianc?e Lisa Harnum into a 15th floor apartment in Sydney CBD. Gittany\u2019s partner decided to quit the business in 2011, three months after Gittany threw his fianc?e of their apartment balcony."
"Thirdly there was Crook\u2019s who had a dream of being treated equally as all the others. He wanted people to not take in to consideration his colour and just allow him to interact with others like anyone else. This also was an unfulfilled dream as he was never accepted by the white community and constantly treated like an outsider. Finally there was Candy who was involved in George and Lennie\u2019s dream which was also incomplete and therefore unaccomplished. The setting of the book \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d was set in the 1930\u2019s."
"To say African Americans were racially discriminated against only because of the color of their skin is an understatement. They were also racially discriminated against because of their sex, their religion, and their social class. During the last decade of the 19th century, racial violence and racial discrimination dramatically increased against African Americans. African Americans were not allowed to anything white people considered to be for \u201cwhites only\u201d."
"He also mentions him to subtly attract the parents to his website. This matches the idea that children\u2019s literature has a dual audience. Dahl wants to attract the adults hopefully to gain some money. Disimilarly, Mail online does not focus on education as being a very important part in children\u2019s literature. For example Scott \u201cfailed his higher English\u201d and he was \u201cdisappointed by the children\u2019s books\u201d that were \u201cfilled with morals and messages about good behaviour- and he wanted something more fun\u201d."
"The constitution is referred to as a set of guidelines within the criminal justice system. It is it\u2019s also known as the absolute law that determines how the United States is governed and how laws are enforced. When discussing ways in which the constitution has contributed to the criminal justice system and its relevance to the death penalty; three exponentially important cases come to mind. The first court case I will discuss is Furman vs Georgia of 1973. In this case the argument was regarding whether the death penalty was in violation of the 8th and the 14th amendment rights. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling was, due to the nature of which the death penalty was inflicted, it does in fact constitute as cruel and unusual punishment thus leading to its suspension for a few years. The next court case that will be discussed is Gregg vs Georgia of 1796. In this case the Supreme Court ruled that as long as the death penalty is given pertinently in accordance with the severity of the crime; it is not unconstitutional to sentence someone to the death penalty. The final court case, Coker vs Georgia, involves whether the death penalty should be invoked for rape. The Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty would be unconstitutional because it does not appropriately fit the crime that was committed. These court cases helped set the premise for how we approach death penalty cases from here on out."
"Furthermore, when dreams are close to being attainable, individuals lose the sense of themselves. In Act II, Scene II, Travis speaks to Walter on behalf of what he is doing tonight, which Walter explains to Travis that he does not understand, Walter says, \u201c You wouldn\u2019t understand yet, son, but your daddy\u2019s gonna make a transaction\u2026 a business transaction that\u2019s going to change our lives\u2026 That\u2019s how come one day when you \u2018bout seventeen years old I\u2019ll come home and I\u2019ll be pretty tired, you know what I mean, after a day of conferences and secretaries getting things wrong the way they do\u201d (Hansberry 108). Walter places attaining the money as the most important thing in his life because he strongly believes he can give his son a better chance in life, he places himself too high, which can result in giving his son nothing. The many years that pass by will cause Travis to keep on waiting only to realize there was not much, to begin with. On the other hand, Further in Act II, Scene II, Walters friend Bobo, tells him that Willy had taken all the money that Mama had given to Walter."
"The character George is described as a small, quick man with well defined features. He dreams of one day saving enough money to buy his own place and being his own boss, although many men in the depression dreamed of this. George is not a strong man physically, but what he lacks physically he makes up for mentally. \u201cThe first man was small and quick, dark of face, with restless eyes and sharp, strong features. Every part of him was defined: small strong hands, slender arms, a thin and bony nose."
"As a result, their learning result is lower than their peers at class. In conclusion, it is undeniable that computer games are beneficial for students\u2019 cognitive abilities, however, I hold the belief that the play of computer games is more harmful for childrens in impairing their health and demotivating their studying at school."
"The final broad category, which comes up for discussion, is that of Psychoanalysis more commonly referred to as Folklore and Therapy. Some argue that such tales are culture specific, for example, Darnton finds the stories colleted by Perrault as simply detailing peasant life in eighteenth century France with its Malthusian environment of scarce food and high infant mortality. Bottigheimer maintains that the stories represent historical documents capable of giving an insight to their time in history. Others though see these folk and fairytales as universal multicultural documents; the greatest exponent of this theory is Bruno Bettleheim."
"We can never really escape or distance ourselves from the influence of our parent\u2019s in our lives because there engraved in our subconscious, traits, and personality. Their accustom, beliefs, morals, and values is what they use to try to develop us as individuals. They mold us to either inherit or shift the way we view our future. A linage cycle that can be inherited by past upbringings or fuel the very desire to overthrow it. Escaping it is inevitable it will creep back in ways of memories, conversation, and physically."
"My mother\u2019s eyes will stare back at mine, as my father\u2019s lips frown back. \u201cAre you ready Ms. Garza?\u201d a lady, only a couple years older than I am right now, will ask me. \u201cToday will be perfect,\u201d I would reassure myself. The curtains would fly open revealing hundreds and thousands of faces staring at me center stage in front of the podium. I would take a deep breath and begin. \u201cAs we are ready to start a new chapter in our lives\u00b7."
"Yemen provides a unique set of geopolitical factors that must be taken into account when determining how to encourage a peaceful future in a historically turbulent social and political environment. This essay will address seven primary geopolitical factors within Yemen in the context of its social, cultural, economic, and political climate, political stability and longevity, access to strategic resources, proximity to allies and enemies, international partnerships, import and export routes, and access to critical supplies, energy, and technology."
"The Kyoto Protocol is a legally binding agreement under which industrialized countries (192 countries) will reduce their collective emissions of greenhouse gases by 5.2% compared to the year 1990. Under the Protocol, countries\u2019 actual emissions have to be monitored and recorded. This thus helps to ensure that all the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by countries is at a safety level. Although the first period of commitment of the protocol has been generally successful in encouraging countries to reduce their greenhouse gases emission, it is not successful in bringing the amount of greenhouse gas emission down. In fact, worldwide atmospheric CO2 levels have soared up to 35% since 1997. Most of that increase has come from\u00a0the United States which did not ratify the protocol. Therefore, it is crucial for every country to be responsible and work together to reduce the emission of the greenhouse gases. Another strategy suggested to reduce global warming is through \u201cSponsor Trees\u201d."
"At the beginning of the story, Armand ordered a corbeille which is something that acts as a dowry, but is given by the groom to the bride. The contents of it wasn\u2019t revealed until Armand has them burned. The corbeille included silk gowns, laces, embroideries, bonnets, and gloves. These items offer a stark contrast between Armand\u2019s attitude towards D\u00e9sir\u00e9e in the beginning until the end of the story. His hatred is so strong that nothing is able to nudge the barrier, that is, until he reads his mother\u2019s letter that he found while burning the items that belong to D\u00e9sir\u00e9e and their child. His mother wrote \u201cBut, above all\u2026 night and day, I thank the good God for having so arranged our lives that our dear Armand will never know that his mother, who adores him, belongs to the race that is cursed with the brand of slavery\u201d (Chopin 434). Through the letter he learns that he is actually in fact part black due to his mother\u2019s origins that was kept secret from him all his life. If he knew the mere fact that he was part black due to his mother, he could have prevented himself to see a person\u2019s race as being more important than their personality. His emotions overpower him, and in what seems to be a desperate attempt to save face, he breaks and destroys any trace or connection he had with Desiree. The readers can tell that his emotions overpower him the burning of the items is a way for him to destroy any connection he had with D\u00e9sir\u00e9e previously."
"In the article \u201cWhat Makes a Good Parent\u201d Robert Epstein provides that some parenting skills have been proven to conduct better out comes in children\u2019s happiness, health, and behavior. In the memoir The Glass Castle, the Walls\u2019 parents are not perfect when it comes to their methods of parenting, but both Rex and Rose Mary do to teach their children valuable life lessons. Even though Rose Mary and Rex Walls\u2019 are seen as unfit parents they both provide evidence of \u201cgood parenting\u201d throughout events in the memoir."
"The perceptions of a criminal, combined with the adultification of black children, means teachers are quick to punish misbehavior. What teachers see as misbehavior, though, children see as a performance. They are trying to get attention by making the other kids laugh, because they are already known as troublemakers. They use the expectation of \u201cacting out\u201d to, \u201ctake center stage, and be admired\u2026a resource for masculinity\u201d (176). The desire to be masculine seems to be an important one for black boys, and they try to achieve it in more ways than one."
"He states that Chinese were hated because they were envious of them. This manuscript was intended for American people to show the truth. It achieved to reveal the truth and explain the purpose of all the chaos. The author has a great point of view that reveals true facts; it makes me realize how cruel the people where at that time. The document tell the viewers how other immigrants where highly bitter by the fact that Chinese immigrant workers where better than them."
"A. \u201cGlobal Warming Fast Facts\u201d (National Geographic News, June 2007) 1. Average temperatures have climbed 1. 4 degrees Fahrenheit around the world since 1880. 2. Arctic ice is rapidly disappearing, and the region may have its first completely ice-free summer by 2040 or earlier. 3. Wildfires,\u00a0heat waves, and\u00a0strong tropical storms, are also attributed in part to climate change. 4. In July of 2006 heat waves contributed to the deaths of at least 225 people in North America. 5."
"The only bread winner of any family \u2013 may be a father or husband or an elder son had to go far off the home. So in those families, especially middle class, wives and mothers had to work in the home and also out of the home. They were the only to take care about every aspects of the family including children. And for this they were not much trained."
"Death row does not prevent homicide happening in the outside world. The death penalty is no more effective in deterring others than life sentences. Life without parole also prevents reoffending. It means what it says, spending the rest of your life locked up, knowing you\u2019ll never be free. Leading up to my next point, life without parole costs less than the death penalty."
"I know that the leadership skills I have acquired will be instrumental in pursuing this end. Since my elementary years, I have been trained to lead by being school president and club officer or member and squad leader in the Korean Army. This attribute, along with my outgoing and hard working nature, will help me realize my professional goal as a manager of a nonprofit organization in the future and my advocacies in life."
"Surely, the lives of black Americans can be said to be better today than it was half a century ago. Rates of poverty for black Americans have decreased, along with black teen-pregnancy rates which have marked an all-time low. Moreover, discriminatory signs such as \u201cWhites Only\u201d or \u201cNo Dogs, Negros & Mexican\u201d that caused humiliation are not seen anymore. However, race still holds a major role in other aspects of the daily lives or communities. Even though poverty levels have decreased, the gap in income between white and black households is roughly the same as it was four decades ago. Such inequality in income still shows the superiority of one race over another, which leads to contrasting lifestyles. As found in a study by Patrick Sharkey, a sociologist at New York University, the percentage of blacks living in poor neighborhoods across America was almost over 50 percent more compared to whites. And the blacks that were born in affluent neighborhoods, tended to fall out of them. All of this goes back to the income gaps led from racial discrimination. understood"
"In my opinion, this type of group is important to build cohesiveness especially for inmates that have been separated from their families for long periods and repetitively. \u201cCognitive-behavioral approaches for offenders and mandated clients work well, especially if the psychoeducational group is structured on a topic such as stress management, problem-solving, or life skills.\u201d Morgan (2004)."
"The story was essentially about Manuela\u2019s look for the daddy of her dead child, Esteban. Manuela did not inform her son anything about his real father, she only told her that he was currently dead long prior to he was born. Nevertheless, Esteban wanted to understand his father much better than her mother\u2019s one-sentence description."
"\u201cDream Job\u201d is one of the main focus in almost everyone life that seeking for success in their future. But who could of thought searching was one of the main key players in the search of pursuing the dream career. As we are living in a country with the most advance in the technology, where people able to search and look for their dream career through online search engine with no limited on the information that they can find. But the only concern was which search engine out there in the world wide web that have the capable to narrow down in giving the most up to date and right information that the searchers needed for their career search."
"Television and movies have had to change their format and even some of their characters in order to obtain political correctness. Even with so many fighting for change, there will always be the ancient invisible barriers blocking the few who are looking to main the status quo. Even with so many people trying to seek improvement for this country, it cannot happen unless every individual is working to abolish racism. There is racism in every facet of life no matter who someone hangs out with, or who someone even works for. Being in the Marine Corps I see different races every day, and work with different races every day. Mission accomplishment is the number one goal of the Marine Corps, so when a job needs to get done every one does their part of their job and race is not an issue. That is the way my career has gone so far, so when I read an article about racism in the Marine Corps it shocks me. New websites and social networking sites are being created all the time."
"Outside of an argument, it\u2019s polite to listen to what people say anyway. People don\u2019t bring up topics if they don\u2019t think it is important enough to be talked about. It is also important to really think about what the other person is saying, not just listen to the words coming out of their mouth. When I was younger, I felt like people would only focus on what they were going to say next and not truly understand what point I was trying to make. I would always get frustrated and I would repeat myself a lot in hopes that I would finally be heard."
"The image of a young black boy with his hands up in front of police stood out to me. There are clips that reference the police brutality that the African American community has become all too familiar with. Beyonc\u00e9 uses this imagery to express how this is an issue that has existed in the past and is not yet respelled. The lyrics that stand out to me are the ones that describe stereotypical African American features, such as afros, \u201cnegro nose,\u201d and others."
"\u201cThe Compromise of 1850 marked the start of a decade of contention and controversy.\u201d (Schaffer). When California wanted to be emitted into the Union as a free state this disrupted the balance of slave states and free states in the Senate. To fix this unbalance in the Union, slavery was not regulated in the remainder of the Mexican cession strengthening a law that compelled Northerners to seize and return slaves that had escaped from the South back to the South, this is known as the Fugitive Slave Act."
"Kiersey (2009) critically examines early childhood education and care policy in Ireland. Five years after the play policy of 2004, she accepts that while the Irish government have, in the previous ten years, invested considerably in the broad early childhood education and care (ECEC) sector a distinction still remained between childcare and early education within Irish policy, both structurally and conceptually. She accepted that there was initial funding put in place for a variety of child care services but that \u201cthere has been no integrated national programme or strategy which aims to encompass both early childhood education and care\u201d. One could reasonably argue that this is somewhat harsh. The desire has been there and she herself admits there has been a proliferation of policy documents but the problem really has to do with funding. Since 2009 there has been much improvement and it could be argued that policy documents like the 2004 play document were the foundation for this growth."
"The first issue to be aware of is that we are all influenced by our cultural background? What we have learned when growing up. In other words, culture is relevant not just to people from other cultures but to all of us. A second issue is that a person is more than their cultural background. Individuals from one cultural background are not all the same as each other. A person\u2019s identity is also shaped by, among other things, their own personality, education, family experience, socioeconomic status and life experience. While we should always be aware of and sensitive to a person\u2019s cultural background, it is important not to make assumptions about the person just because they are a member of a particular CALD community (The Cultural and Linguistically Diverse)."
"As Christians, I believe one of our roles is to speak for those who are not able to speak for themselves. That does not mean to take over, but we can learn about the issues in our country, build relationships with those in our community, and speak up and become creative in finding ways to support all individuals in the educational system. Christians can be used as tools for others. Leading by example in how we interact with others; even how we speak about individuals in our community. Loving others is vital."
"The point of view of James is also seen in this chapter; James recall that he sees her mother as different at such an early age, although he really cannot fully comprehend why in fact she is different from others. This is highlighted in the account when James already reaches kindergarten; he asks his mother why she is different from him, although her mother refuses to entertain the question (McBride, n. pag. ). Her bitter memories regarding her family influences her not to open the topic later in her life, soon to be understood by James."
"As a nurse, the interventions we can give to the family if there is an unavailability of community resources, the nurse can advise her family to visit the relevant community websites or links on important information and search the web for topics that could assist them Belle\u2019s continuous growth and further development of her family."
"Slave-owners don\u2019t want their adult slave women to spend much time on taking care of their children, so they assign one slave woman to take care of all the children, while the slave mothers have to work at other places soon after they give birth. The other type is the women who take the role of mother voluntarily, based on the situation request or personal thoughts, such as Baby Suggs, who mothers the whole black community after she is bought free by her son Hale. Othermothers have been paid certain attention and exert great influence in this novel. The concept of protection is the common factor for mothers and othermothers."
"Nowadays we are afraid of Pennywise or Sinister, admire vampires, zombies and witches. But did you know that all of these monsters are the representation of boogeyman? Of course, they\u2019ve changed their shapes, some special characteristics were added, but all of them are used to represent fear of unknown, unconscious mind, the consequences of disobeying, cultural differences. In mythology and folklore we could see boogeyman appearing in different places and in variety of shapes."
"In the essay, \u201cCultural Baggage\u201d by Barbara Ehrenreich believed that you do not have to be the religion or culture you were raised with. Ehrenreich believed that everyone was their own person and could be who they want to be. She was apart of her own culture called \u201cnothing\u201d culture, that meant she didn\u2019t follow any of the cultural acts that her family would. She believe she could do whatever she wanted even if it wasn\u2019t like her culture."
"This is because of the fact that it is a movie and can therefore open to a wider audience and is more accessible to people then a novel is. Film is also a deeper medium in which to portray the issues of racism because it can explore more into the senses of people. Through film the audience can engage both the senses of sight and hearing through the use of visual graphics and audio stimulating materials such as music soundtracks. Film techniques can also be taken advantage of for example high or low camera angles which can be used during the process of filming to help present the issues within the film."
"The speaker of the poem is grieving his father who he lost to battle and experiences struggles in coping with it all. McDonald\u2019s details about the sled mentioned in the poem reflect the closeness that was once there between the speaker and his father, in addition to the level of importance the speaker\u2019s father had in his life. The use of diction by McDonald also emphasizes the speaker\u2019s mourning, often accompanied by nostalgia, by implicating the repetition of the words \u201cI remember\u201d throughout the poem."

"Imagine that you want to\u00a0tell a\u00a0story to\u00a0your friend. Will you start with some cold facts and boring statistics? Surely, no! There must be\u00a0some hook in\u00a0your first paragraph.

"In chapter four of the story \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d we are immediately introduced to Crooks. Through the great detailed description given by Steinbeck the reader can learn many things about Crooks\u2019 character. Crooks\u2019 name itself suggests that there is something physically wrong with him. His physical disability is one of the many ways that he suffers on the ranch. He is not shown much in the first three chapters and this indicates his position in society as very low because he is not noticed, and therefore is not important."
"I shortly realize that in order to be part of the team I would have had to be part of her group of friends. The only members who made the team happened to be her select group of friends. It did not mattered how hard I tried or that I had the ability and experience in track, what matter was that I was not in her social group. I was not going to allow myself to be a part of a group of people who would discriminate against someone new or different. I have dignity and pride and I did not intend to put myself in a position where I would have to discriminate just to \u201cfit\u201d in."
"The powerlessness of the Californian labouring class loomed indefatigably and the opportunity for advancing in society was practically non-existent. Steinbeck\u2019s examination of the reality in \u2018Of mice and men\u2019 sets the story a few miles south of Soledad. Soledad is Spanish for \u201csolitude\u201d, the intense loneliness and anger engendered by hopelessness. The reader is drawn in by the doomed appeal of Lennie and George, which inevitably shapes their friendship and their dream."
"Although Atticus is hesitant to pull the trigger, he carries through with the task for the safety of the neighbourhood and its residents. Harper Lee uses the dog itself as a symbol for the madness Atticus has to confront when he accepts Tom Robinson\u2019s case. The majority of Maycomb County is against Atticus and his will to properly defend Tom Robinson, as they genuinely believe Tom is culpable based on no other evidence other than the fact he is black. Atticus shows determination to defend Tom Robinson, even when his closest neighbours turn against him, he stands against the \u201csocial norms\u201d and represents what he believes to be morally right."
"He gave her everything she wanted, including a big house, money, jewelry, and whatever else she asked for. In Nigeria, it is expected that the rich remain in power. The General lived up to this expectation by making Uju ask him for everything she needed. This put her in a submissive position and gave the General control over her. When Ifemelu confronted her Aunt Uju about her situation, Uju insisted that she was going to \u2018change\u2019 her lover. Even though Uju made some progress, overall this relationship only contributed to Nigeria\u2019s perceptions about relationships. Powerful and rich men get what they want, when they want it. They are often seen as superiors due to their wealth. This could be seen when The General was supposed to spend the holiday with Uju (instead of his wife) but he cancelled last minute. Instead of being mad at The General, she turns her frustrations toward Ifemelu who spoke up against him; Aunty Uju charged at her \u2018the slap landed on the side of her face\u2019 (Adichie 98.) Uju acted powerless in this situation, and Ifemelu recognized it. Aunty Uju simply acted as a servant to The General. Ifemelu attempted to have a real conversation with her Aunt, but she was in denial. Nigerian society had persuaded Uju that there was little she could do \u2013 and she believed it."
"In the modern system of society and education in India, nobody takes the responsibility of the child\u2019s welfare. The parents think that it is a responsibility of the teachers, because the child stays in the school for six hours a day. The teachers think that it is the responsibility of the parents, because the children belong to their parents, and in future the children will come to any use only to their parents and families. But in the interest of society, nation, country and above all mankind all have responsibility for the welfare of the children. Conclusion:"
"In a 2009 interview on Good Morning America, Brooke Breedwell, a pageant queen at the age of five, now twenty, explained there was a price to pay, \u201cPageants have put a lot of stress and anxiety on my life I feel the need to be perfect at everything, and I know that\u2019s not realistic. You can\u2019t be perfect at everything. \u201d Brooke Breedwell also claimed her mother \u201cpushed her too hard. \u201d When a mother enters her daughter in a pageant she expects her to win."
"In the most recent years many cases of excessive force being used against unarmed African Americans have gone unnoticed or have been hidden away from the public (). There are cases involving African Americans or black communities that don\u2019t recall the correct events that occurred. In the case of Sandra Bland who was found hanging in her jail cell, there are questionable factors or evidence not present that makes the case seem all too unreal (). At first glance the death was ruled a suicide], however that was hard for many to believe giving who Sandra was and what she supported. Sandra Bland was an active civil rights member who participated and started many protests and rallies to fight for the black community\u2019s American civil rights. Many believe that Sandra was arrested and killed due to this fact (_). Civil rights groups and leaders took a stand to fight for justice for Sandra Bland and demanded that her case be reopened and retried. Sandra Bland\u2019s death was another eye opening incident to remind black communities that the issue has yet to leave but still lingers over their heads. Police brutality has a reoccurrence through history that has become an apparent pattern. The mistreatment and targeting of minority communities has caused a rift tearing apart a once united nation. The minority death count is rising at an alarming rate and something has to happen to put it to an end. The continuing oppression of minority groups can only cause further hostile complications to occur that won\u2019t have a happy ending"
"This puts the mother in a dangerous and life-threatening situation, with 8 out of 10 of these women develop complications. With these findings, pro-choice groups believe that if abortion would be legalized, abortion will now take place in medical settings, ensuring the safety of the mother. They also emphasize that victims of rape, incest, and sexual trafficking who become pregnant because of the abuse should be given the right for abortion since they did not plan on having a baby in the first place."
"After the season, Coach Ron Meyer took a job as head coach of the New England Patriots, arising speculation that Meyer might be leaving just in time before the Mustangs would get caught for something else by the NCAA. After Meyer\u2019s departure, new stories began to circulate in the 1983 season after SMU began to recruit players from outside of the state, including Sean Stopperich, a student from Pittsburg. SMU reportedly offered Stopperich $5,000 for signing with SMU along with an apartment complex for his family outside Dallas."
"The large size of most of the studies and the manner in which they were done provide good evidence that induced labor does not affect a woman\u2019s risk of developing breast cancer. In 2003, the U. S. National Cancer Institute had a workshop with more than 100 of the world\u2019s leading experts who study pregnancy and breast cancer risk. They all found that neither induced or spontaneous abortion are linked to an increase in breast cancer risk; the level of scientific evidence for these findings was considered the highest level, \u2018well established\u2019."
"He was sent to the USA on a scholarship and was extremely dissatisfied with what he saw as a secularized country. He feared the impact of the West on Islam and this experience could be viewed as the trigger as he began writing and it was his writing which criticized the American and Western Way of living that provided his primary source of influence or impact on the development and expression of Islam."
"Arrow of God is the third book written by Achebe was published in 1964. Like its procedures, it explores the intersections of Igbo tradition and European Christianity. Set in the village of Umuaro at the start of the end of the twentieth century, the novel tells the story of Ezeulu, the chief priest of Ulu. Shocked by the power of British intervention in the area, he orders"
"\u2019 (A1, S2, L31). My services which I have done the signiory Shall out-tongue his complaints\u2019 (A1, S2, L18). According to the Aristotelian model of tragedy, this pride would lead to an error of judgment or mistake, the harmartia. His confidence may invoke the idea that his right hand man, Iago, would be consistently loyal to him; therefore his mistake would be trusting Iago\u2019s lies. However, Othello\u2019s self-assuredness could be a positive quality, a representation of his instinctive authority and level-headedness that provokes jealousy in Iago."
"Nowadays, more and more people are suffering from these diseases and this contributes towardsthe cases of death. Civil rights are class of right and freedom that protect the individual from unwarrantedgovernment action. What this mean is that violation of civil rights is our local labor right has been taken by the illegal immigrants. Most employers in our country like to hire them rather thanour own local workers. The cost to hire foreign workers is cheaper than locals in terms of their salary."
"Paiute and Sierra Miwok are the people who lived in Yosemite area long before the whites explored into the region. The Ahwahneechee, who were Native Americans, lived in Yosemite Valley when the first foreign people entered .White travel increased in the area in the mid-19th century due to the California Gold Rush [32] . Jim Savage of the States Army led the Mariposa Battalion in 1851 to the west end of Yosemite Valley in while pursuing around 200 Ahwahneechees led by Chief Tenaya as part of Mariposa wars. Chief Tenaya founded the Pai-Ute colony of Ah-wa-nee. The Miwoks, most white settlers, saw the Ahwahneechee as violent owing to frequent territorial disputes. Tenaya and all the Ahwahneechee were later captured and their village burned; they were moved to a reservation in California near Fresno [33] ."
"Between 1980 and 1997, 55% of the victims of juvenile homicide offenders were ages 13 through 24, I would think that would send an urgent message to society saying that crime is starting at a younger age each generation.Crime sprouts from the young minds who spend their time playing with pretend guns, watching violence on tv and watching their favorite super heros violently kill the villan. Does any of this have any long term psychological results? While growing up with guns and weapons the results in the end are children growing up thinking guns are okay."
"Every single minute that she is spending in that country makes her feel isolated. For instance, sampang says \u201cI didn\u2019t see the magic nor feel the peace these surroundings offer\u201d in motherhood for dollars article. Since the time differences mother can\u2019t talk to them every time since their children are sleeping and they have less time to share their feeling and ideas each other sampan in the motherhood for dollars says that \u201d bye bye lub you mwah mwah afterwards I\u2019ll go to bed happy, back to my own life and they back to theirs similarly \u201cwhen I called my mom to tell my problems that I\u2019m having here without her she said\u201d I\u2019m busy I love you I will call you back my love\u201d so it maked not to tell anything to her because she is busy\u201d(Medeleine Vibert,They stole my innocence/toni Maguire,page:200)"
"The organizations or Mr.Gilman should do to minimize the perception models is, Mr.Gilman should ask the questions to Beauport why she declines his offer instead of accepting it, and asking her assumption or her thought about market research coordinator. Mr.Gilman should clarify his intention in offering the job position at market research coordinator to her. He wants Beauport to improve and expand her experiences and skills, enhance her career in the company and also this is one of the best platforms to obtain a position at top-level management as Mr.Gilman and not trying to downgrade her. He also needs to get an explanation about Beauport\u2019s opinion and her perspective regarding the offer to avoid any misunderstanding."
"It has come to my attention as of recent how devastating racism is today. Despite social laws and equality rights, racism still plays a huge part in society in the United States.There are many active hate groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, Neo-Nazis, White Supremacists and more. Racism is difficult to define because it has so many meanings, but it usually classifies as a belief that one race is most pure and more superior than any other race. Common races that are discriminated against in the United States are African Americans, Mexican Americans, and people of Middle Eastern descent (this includes refugees)."
"I do not care for the drug trafficking taking place, nor do I care for the violent crimes being committed by so many immigrants. I do believe that the federal government has allowed this to happen over the years. If America\u2019s lax immigration system would come to an end and instead enforce its immigration laws with not only consistency but also common sense, America would be a safer place for all of us. For the immigrants crossing the border, sufficient law enforcement is the only way to keep them from entering the United States. For those immigrants coming in by sea or air, we must have strict policies and we must make sure that the people working at entry points do their jobs in assessing the security needed to keep illegal migrants from entering the U.S. Airport inspectors, no matter what delays they may be encountering, must carefully examine visas before stamping their approval. They must request required documentation, regardless of the hassle it may involve."
"The magazine will have articles that satisfies their needs e. g. how to deal with pregnancy issues, what to expect after delivery, tips on successful marriages etc. this consists of 30% of the general population. 3. Single individual These are people who are not married and are not expecting a child. They include both male and females. This market segment is large, hence the variety of the articles in the magazine is meant to capture them. These generally consist of 35% of the population. Though these target audiences aren\u2019t married but in the future they are i. e. 3-10years."
"Aside from love, marriage is depicted in the novel as a way of escape from poverty. This is reflected in Mrs. Bennet\u2019s only goal in life. The Bennet maternal figure may fall short of good graces and personality but her incessant longing for her daughters to be married is perfectly normal. She may possess unacceptable mannerisms which turn people off yet she has a genuine and sincere heart that goes out for her daughters. She wanted them to be prosperous, well-taken cared of and in a joyful relationship. She is not the embodiment of a perfect mother but she supports her daughters in their respective romantic life."
"The article tries to elucidate on the subject of what makes a person. However, Fox was unable to give a rigid conclusion and left the matter open to discussion. Although he elucidated on physical continuity, I think that he should not have discredited psychological continuity; additional explanation should have been made to let the reader decide for themselves."
"The South had thought that if the Union cut of their cotton shipments to Britain then they would give support to the Confederacy. This did not transpire though, as Britain began to get their cotton from Egypt. Also, Britain was opposed to slavery and so gave any support to the North."
"In conclusion, one can say that it is obvious that violence is at times politicized, and at other times, romanticized, but no matter how one views it, violence and acts of aggression and violence seem to be on the rise, and unless one stands up and takes notice, it may be much too difficult to put an end to the phenomenon."
"Self-disclosure is also something that can be based off your upbringing and your social background. I had trouble when I was first married with self-disclosure due to the fact that my mother never did it around me. I had to be taught how to do it. The same goes for my communication skills. Although scientists may generalize woman and say we are the communicators I beg to differ, that it is another skill that I had to be taught.\u00a0Generalizing is something that I do not agree with all the time."
"Hypertension (High Blood Pressure) is a sickness that a large number of individuals of various types are influenced by. Besides, in spite of the fact that pressure and passionate strain can incidentally expand pulse; yet it won\u2019t be considered as hypertension. Hypertension for the most part is there without any side effects."
"I think what Cooley was saying about the looking glass self is that when we are around others, we act upon how they are acting. The example Cooley uses in the book is how professors have to determine if her students understand or if they are engaged in the subject she is teaching. Most of the time we take someone expressions differently then how they mean them. When you are out at Wal-Mart, you see a group of girls they are whispering and looking your way. Naturally you would start to feel self-conscious and try to remove yourself from that situation as quickly as you can. Cooley is saying that what if they weren\u2019t making fun of your lazy outfit or the tired bags under your eyes. We might be taking other people\u2019s expressions the wrong way and causing ourselves to be self-conscious."
"After staying with Jackie\u2019s uncle, they was eventually able to afford a place. They quickly learned that being black in a mostly white neighborhood would prove to be a challenge. Neighbors would often shout cruel names at the family, and constantly call the police for no apparent reason. The family was able to preserve taking the prejudice and turning it into pride."
"The next part of the issue is who can file for the minor. Jane would be classified as either a minor principal or an unaccompanied minor according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The difference between the two is a minor principal is a person under the age of 18 when filing for asylum by one\u2019s own right, as opposed to as a derivative family member on a parent\u2019s or spouse\u2019s asylum application. An unaccompanied minor principal applicant for asylum who is under 18 years of age and who has no parent or legal guardian in the U.S. who is available to provide care and physical custody. This definition encompasses separated minors, e.g., those who are separated from their parents or guardians, but who are in the informal care and physical custody of other adults, including family members."
"Michael woods was a firm believer that slavery was the cause of the Civil war and the disagreement between the North and South. \u201cslavery and freedom remain the keys to understanding the war.\u201d He goes on to say that this conflict creates more questions which is why many historians agree. Throughout this article, Edwards writes about how people should question the reasons for the Civil War because it will cause you to dig farther into history. \u201cEarly national battles over slavery did not make the Civil War inevitable, but in the hands of propagandists they could make the war seem inevitable to many contemporaries.\u201d"
"Q. Describe the information which needs to be shown on your pay slip. A. Pay slips need to include the name of the company you work for, your name and Tax code, your national insurance number, the payment date, the deductions and adjustments made, your gross pay and your net pay and a summary of pay from year to date including national insurance. Q. Identify two changes to personal information which you must report to your employer."

"\u2019 (Gray & Putnam, 2009:18). Without laughter fear would not be defeated and fears of the truth would not be overcome, with this society becomes reliant on laughter, it gives a sense of belonging, understanding and serves as a joint understanding and belief. (Clark, 1996) This idea of the truth is based upon Bahktin\u2019s theoretical view on laughter, as Gray and Putnam (2009: 18) state, \u2018Laughter is also a defence mechanism against external realities that contradict our inner truths."
"During the interwar period, Britain underwent an economic transformation. The established industries such as those that produced staple goods, were experiencing stronger competition from overseas, Britain at the time was being accused of not adapting its production of its staple industries to new technological advances that were being implemented and taken advantage of in other parts of the world. As cited by Derek Aldcroft(1983), the impact of the war on the British economy showed in the rates of 1913-29, they were abnormally low, this combined with the reduction in exports led to the collapse of the export market of the staple industries."
"Simon stated that \u201cin the long run, the most important economic effect of population size and growth is the contribution of additional people to our stock of useful knowledge. This supports the idea that abortion robs us of the resources of over 40 million people. To further support this, Laura included a reference by economist, Jacqueline Kasun who showed that even poor children return 3.7 times what was spent on her and her mother in cash welfare and food, housing, and medical assistance in taxes.Antkowiak concluded by showing that rather than benefits, abortions have costs to our economy.These ideas can however be criticised using the idea that these 40 million individuals are not guaranteed to be useful to the economy."
"Armand Aubigny shows his violent features all along the story, also seen when he makes his wife leave their house, \u201cYes, I want you to go\u201d, which will be more in deep developed among this essay. Armand does not seem to feel or to care, instead, he appears as a really insensitive person; \u201cforgotten how to be gay\u2026Armand\u2019s dark,handsome face had not often been disfigured by frowns since the day he fell in love with her. \u201d It is not only his behavior but also his physical characteristics are showing a person who is not present, and is not taking care of his things in life."
"Within this passage Crooks\u2019 room is described as \u2018swept and fairly neat\u2019, this is showing that although Crooks lives on his own he still wants to keep his room tidy even though he is living alone and no one ever visits him, so he has no need to keep his room clean."
"After taking a look at his life and then rereading \u201cDefence and Happiness of Married Life\u201d (1712) one finds it quite ironic to realize that one of the greatest joys of marriage as put-forth is one that he himself was denied in his own marriage: You must have observed, in your Speculations on Human Nature, that nothing is more gratifying to the Mind of Man than Power or Dominion; and this I think my self amply possessed of, as I am the Father of a Family. I am perpetually taken up in giving out Orders, in prescribing Duties, in hearing Parties, in Administering Justice, and in distributing Rewards and Punishments."
"The costumes in this play depict the clothes worn in ancient times. The characters in each set have clothes relating to the theme. The phantom costumes reveal a hat with an attached mask and cape, this feature depicts fear and the true state of a fearless living. A phantom should hide his face so as to inflict a sense of fear and suspense to his subject. The costumes worn by Christine reveal the character of an innocent girl in such of love, she is adorable and every one falls in love with her at first site. The setting of the theater is fantastic as rights change depending on the character and theme."
"Husband tends to be the disciplinarian in the household, as he is calm and very patient. Husband and wife both consider themselves bread winners. They cook together when they can and pay the bills together. The children\u2019s roles are to go to school, get good grades, and to help maintain the house."
"In everyday life, unity can be achieved if people are tolerant of each other. The gotong-royong activity is an effective step in instilling a sense of unity within the community as it is a time for the community to cooperate and help one another to clean up an area. In addition, the gotong-royong activities also opened up opportunities for the community to meet and get to know each other. In social relations, society must be sincere in establishing relationships with people of different skin, culture and race. By adopting a spirit of belonging, a comfortable and harmonious neighbourhood can be maintained while maintaining a sense of security in the local area. When every society adopts pure values, solidarity between the people can be born and even envy and misunderstanding can be avoided and the independence of the nation will continue for generations to come."
"Because of this reason, American\u2019s are placed in a disadvantaged position in the business community and global marketplace which are landscapes that encourages the usage of different languages. Through multiculturalism, the mastery of a secondary language is given priority in different sectors. It was also posted that learning another language enhances the mental mobility of an individual and provide a holistic view of the cultural background of the said learned language."
"The family has the strength of willingness to learn. Not everybody is open-minded and willing to learn. The mother thought that this was a strength of the family as well. The family is willing to go and talk to other families and express what they know. They also listen to ways that can help make home life a little easier. The family likes to know ways to help their son that they may not have thought of."

"Honest Sancho begins his showroom tour with the Farm Worker\u2019s features, liking him to the most standard \u2018model\u2019 that is equipped with durable \u2018Four ply Goodyear huaraches, made from the rain tire'(Valdez 959). The liking of the farm workers shoes to Goodyear tires is followed by a demonstration of his hard working, friendly persona, but then like a car buyer would mutter on a budget, Miss Jimenez asks \u2018But is he economical'(Valdez 960)? This question prompts Honest Sancho to liken the Farm Worker to a Volkswagen car, dehumanizing the Farm Worker in a humorous simile."
"As far as the culture is concerned, lobolo fortifies and brings down the index of divorces in the society. Indeed, once a couple is culturally engaged into marriage divorce is virtually unthinkable (qtd. in Ng\u2019ang\u2019a 6, Nkosi 77). Divorce, can only happen if the husband does not sexually satisfy the wife or if he inconspicuously has some extra marital affairs, and consequently, neglects his wife (Bourdillon 66). Furthermore, the couple can only break up if the wife shows an inability to cook, to do the laundry, and to care for the household. Lobolo is to compensate the loss of a productive daughter. As a matter of fact, the wife dedicates herself working in the field and look after the household; she also works for her husband and his family (Bourdillon 37). This follows that what she got from her parents will be beneficial for other people. Therefore, something must be given to her family. Now woman\u2019s productivity is made of education, clothing, feeding, and so on. These are the reasons why Mozambican society keeps the practice of paying bride price to bride\u2019s family."
"What was I doing at Reardan, whose mascot was an Indian, thereby making me the only other Indian in town?\u201d (Alexie 56). This demonstrates that Junior feels the need to isolate and view himself as an outsider compared to other kids at Reardon, he has an instinct that there was no way he could ever belong. Junior also spends a lot of time drawing out a picture of the contrast between whites and Indians."
"\u2019 like the rest of the men because he hasn\u2019t got the energy or strength like the other men have which means that he is lonely all day and has to wait for them to come back. He can\u2019t go down to Soledad because he is too old \u201cafter that the guys went down to Soledad and raised hell, I didn\u2019t go there, I aint got the poop no more\u201d"
"Even though Richard Kuklinski did gruesome crimes some may sympathize because it was all triggered by his parents that would abuse and torture him and his sibling. His horrible childhood still doesn\u2019t fully explain why a person could be so uncaring and heartless. Due to his actions this has led him earn a spot on death row."
"Spending time in the Californian\u2019s beautiful beaches, parks and trails is great but it is even greater when you do it with your playful friend. In Carmel, dogs are allowed to go together with their owners and they are even offered biodegradable waste bags at the entrance of the parks, trails and beaches."
"In this poem, although the narrator seemed uncaring to his father\u2019s objections to his mother\u2019s death, it seems that in this instance, that he longs to hear his bitter words of complaint as opposed to the silence which is now on earth, forever. With the differing forms and structures of the two poems, this may create the idea that although at times, society can change us, it is the dramatic changes in our lives that can make us see more profoundly on the subjects that we took or take for granted. This may be backed up in the first stanza of the first poem, in comparison to the last stanza in the second poem."
"There is need to change the school curricula so that it can accommodate the diverse cultural needs. This will make it both relevant to the needs of students from diverse backgrounds and sensitive to the issues of social justice. A bicultural curriculum presents the diverse cultures as equally important and powerful. Such programs which have been implemented in some schools have shown that where children are not made to renounce their culture, their academic performance improves dramatically (Bowman, 1994). Existentialism calls for authenticity of the self in the face of indifference (Rupp, 2001)."
"Husband and wife feel sex is a very important part of their relationship. They feel it keeps them close and connected. The 16-year-old says she has not \u201cdone that\u201d, but that if she had, she would not be saying it in front of her parents. Her parents say they want to keep the lines of communication open on this subject, but their daughter just shakes her head no. The 10-year-old does not seem to know what to make of this conversation."
"Likewise, this panel also appears as the biggest in size on this page to emphasize how important this newfound connection between Dana and Rufus is. Dana\u2019s clothing and Rufus\u2019 clothing also are particularly noteworthy, as it helps to distinguish between the two time periods from which both characters come from."
"The behaviourist theory suggests that language is learned, with correct grammar being reinforced through rewards or praise, and incorrect grammars discarded due to punishment or negative feedback. Advocates of the behaviourist theory challenged Chomsky\u2019s UG, but the majority of researchers seemed to support and accept it, at least for the most part, as the best explanation for a still unexplained phenomenon. Those that agreed with his view provided a range of supporting arguments, though the evidence in support of these arguments is not concrete. When he first theorised its existence, it was done so by observation only, with no evidence provided. Based off his theory, research into the biological and physiological processes of language acquisition was pursued, resulting in the many supporting arguments now referred to when discussing UG, as well as those that are in fierce opposition of Chomsky."
"Whoever got the most questions correct or could complete her worksheets correctly would getjust one starburst. This little incentive to doing our work and learning the material not only made us work hard to get the correct answers, but made the whole learning of the lesson fun and interesting. This to me is a great example of how this knowledge can be helpful in the classroom. After working at the carnival and spending time with the children, I realized that interaction with children is very important. Children in elementary school are very young and need much attention. I constantly had to remind the children that were playing the bean toss that even though they missed the first toss, they still had more chances to go. If I hadn\u2018t of said anything and interacted with them, they would have given up after the first try."
"Another aspect of Indian society is the fact that is appears to cover your affection towards your partner. This is quite the opposite of a western culture \u201cCathy was rather a demonstrative girl and liked kissing and holding hands with Narain when other people were looking, and indeed in England he had enjoyed that, too and they sat there in coffee bars and on park benches with their arms slung closely around each other."
"This most likely applies most likely to young black men (Anderson 1990) in neighborhoods with \u201cmixed racial\u201d inhabitants. Combating Black-on-Black Crimes The problem on black-on-black crime cannot be instantly resolved. The way towards the solution of this social problem would really entail a lot of efforts and factors. It may take years, decades or more for us to get over or to lessen the rate of black-on-black crimes. But then, if we are really determined to combat or at least lessen the figures of the occurrence of black-on-black crime, then, we will surely be successful in our aim."
"It can be argued that the gods support Medea and Deus ex Machina occurs in order to dispense justice by not allowing Jason to bury his children and leaving him unsatisfied. Although, the gods not always seem to make \u2018right\u2019 decision and sometimes their will performs as cruel and unmoral. It isn\u2019t just the fact that Medea kills her children that seem to be questioning Medea\u2019s heroic aspects. It is also true that Medea does not die. The play is in fact the only surviving Greek tragedy where the tragic hero doesn\u2019t die."
"Since the our president was elected in 2016, Donald Trump has made a couple of big moves on immigration, like the refugee and travel ban executive order as well as his administration\u2019s zero-tolerance immigration policy. Trump\u2019s ban indefinitely suspends the issuance of immigrant and nonimmigrant visas to applicants from the Muslim-majority countries Libya, Iran, Somalia, Syria and Yemen; plus North Korea and Venezuela. Our vote in this year\u2019s midterms won\u2019t directly affect current immigration law. Congress has control over most immigration-related regulations because they are matter of federal law. In the midterms, we are casting our ballot for members of Congress. They are the ones who handle immigration law, so when we vote in the midterms, we are voting for the people who create those laws and regulations. We must vote for senators who will support immigrants in the U.S."
"Catholic teachings from 1930 state that \u2018human beings are made in the image of God\u2019 therefore abortion is breaking the commandment \u2018Love the Lord your God\u2019. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that \u201cHuman life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognised as having the rights of a person- among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life.\u201d In the Pope\u2019s new encyclical he says, \u201cthe killing of innocent human creatures, even if carried out to help others, constitutes an absolutely unacceptable act.\u201d The Pope is emphasising that no that no commandment, other than \u2018love your god\u2019, is more important than this."
"among a group of their peers fair, representation and the right not to be harmed by those who hold authority by law in which they represent. We have ethical responsibility s citizens to follow the rules and regulation of our count try and they s Law Enforcement Officers have n ethical obligation to lead by example."
"This deep dissatisfaction with life is the source of almost every character\u2019s racist beliefs. In one scene, John goes in to talk to Shaniqua, the insurance representative, and asks for a new doctor his father, who has trouble urinating and hasn\u2019t improved. When she refuses, he lectures her about the \u201cmore qualified white men\u201d who could have her job. He tells the story of his father, who started his own company, hired all black employees and had a contract with the city of Los Angeles. When the city decided to give preference to minority-owned businesses, his father \u201covernight, lost everything\u201d. John has to watch his father sit on the toilet for hours, trying to pee. He uses minorities as a scapegoat for his painful experience with his father in old age. Before Jean falls, she tells her friend on the phone that she is angry at everyone in her life, and she thought she would feel better in the morning. Instead, she still feels angry. She admits that she feels this way every morning. She expresses this anger through a fear of others, exemplified by her rant on minorities."
"Then you blame yourself, what did I\u00a0do? It\u00a0is\u00a0my\u00a0entire fault what should I\u00a0do? Now betrayal is\u00a0never easy and we\u00a0all have different ways to\u00a0deal with\u00a0it, but at\u00a0the end of\u00a0the day we\u00a0are all human we\u00a0all feel these emotions, you never know what might have caused your friend to\u00a0betray you, but since you were betrayed you learned something new. So\u00a0you might betray someone else. It\u2019s just a\u00a0human thing, something we\u00a0all may never understand but we\u00a0just do\u00a0it. We\u00a0all make mistakes, and in\u00a0the right circumstances, only you make your own desiscions. You\u2019re responsible for you."
"This plan can hopefully help children maintain appropriate limits on digital media exposure that will allow for healthy, balanced development. Currently, children 8 to 12 years old are estimated to spend over six hours a day using digital media. (Common Sense Media, 2015) Yes, some digital media content can be educational, but most digital media is not encouraging children\u2019s development. I think in addition to setting limits and having a digital media plan, families should be aware of the dangers of having media in bedrooms. The beginning study allows us to see that media in the bedroom tends to be detrimental to children\u2019s development. In any situation where the media devices can be removed from the bedroom, I believe it should be. This act will improve adherence to the family media plan and help ensure parental oversight to prevent aggressive, violent, inappropriate content."
"The novel, Deadly Unna, written by Phillip Gwynne tells the story of the multicultural bond between the Aboriginal up and coming football player Dumby Red and his loyal Australian mate Gary (Blacky) Black. There are many issues explored in the novel, such as family, domestic violence and above all, racism. Moreover, the novel demonstrates the issue of family. The Black family is portrayed as very dysfunctional. The reader understands from early on in the novel that Garry Black\u2019s father is an unreasonable, irresponsible and violent father."
"Our sense of identity is derived from meaning and therefore meaning is linked with questions about how we use culture to define and maintain identity and difference within and between groups. In every social and personal relationship in which we participate, meaning is constantly being produced. Meaning is also produced through our expression in and consumption of relevant cultural materials."
"I think if I had to present this information I would ask the students to do a paper about the topic using only the information provided in their textbooks and then to see if they can find different information to either go along with what they learned in their textbooks or to see if they find something new. Then after they had given a presentation on what they had found I would ask their opinions of what they found and then present this information to them."
"The supporters of this policy also do not care to mention or realize themselves, the overwhelming taxes that are caused by illegal immigrants. These taxes are not only derived from the sanctuary jurisdiction, but from every community in America. As stated in the article Fair Federation for American Immigration Reform states that, \u2018Illegal immigration is a huge burden to state and local governments, costing taxpayers an estimated $113 billion in 2013.\u2019 (Sanctuary Policy is Bad Public Policy, 2017). As many would like to think that their taxes are rebuilding America to make it a better place, they are also being used to support a policy that does more harm than good, and the general public has no idea that the policy even exists. Taxes are based on the public knowing that their money is contributing to their communities. In this scenario, the public is oblivious to this donation of their money. The argument can be made that many individuals don\u2019t agree what taxes are used for even if it\u2019s used for fixing roads. However, this is not to better America if it is giving criminals of another country sanctuary, and avoiding the consequences of their crimes in their country as well as the crimes they commit in America. The taxes that are used to support this policy are paving the road for more officials in power of their local district, to go ahead and disregard the law, and make loopholes to bypass it. Instead, these taxes for this policy could be used to improve American lives, but because of the ignorance of the real statistics, no one is in great opposition against the policy."
"The purpose of this article is to show the benefits of using the Wii as a therapeutic intervention for those with a TBI. Brain injuries often require rehabilitative services to address impairments in cognitive, physical and psychosocial functioning (Kenuk, S., Borders, R., Palmer, K., & Nelson, R. 2015). Findings indicated that interventions using the Wii and similar video game activities contributed to improvements in physical, cognitive and psychosocial functioning in individuals with brain injuries (Kenuk, S., Borders, R., Palmer, K., & Nelson, R. 2015). Some of the findings included an increase of range of motion, coordination, gross motor skills, and mobility (physical), improved reaction time, memory, information processing and attention (cognitive). Improvements on psychosocial domain included increased self- esteem and increase of quality of the participants life. The Wii can be very beneficial for all populations and diagnoses. The use of playing the Wii for individuals diagnosed with a TBI is a very beneficial intervention (Kenuk, S., Borders, R., Palmer, K., & Nelson, R. 2015)."
"Through Candy\u2019s dog\u2019s unfortunate death, it is made implicit that fait awaits all who outlive their usefulness in the american society, drawing out the unrecognized emotional value within the capitalist market, which is a constant method used by the author which relates the character Candy to the raw reality of civilization, allowing the character to continue to be a relatable symbol in today\u2019s world."
"In conclusion, John Steinbeck\u2019s style of writing impacted society just as he had hoped. He wrote about real life experiences and hardships to show the reader what people went through, like the Joads and the many characters in \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d. Steinbeck informed the reader of what families had to overcome, which ultimately impacted whoever read his novels. The use of realism, characterization, and dreams in his two novels made them the greatest American novels in history."
"[q]uestion the naturalness of cultural texts and to see that prevailing ideas are not self-evident and obvious, but are constructed, biased, and contestable. This notion makes us suspicious and critical, putting into question regnant ideas which often serve the interests of governing groups. Moreover, the more one studies cultural forms and representations, the more one sees the presence of ideologies that support the interests of the reigning economic, gender, race, or social groups who are presented positively and idealized, while subordinate groups are often presented negatively and prejudicially."
"Able to escape with some of his forces, Lee was forced to move westward in hopes of rendezvousing with reinforcements, but was cut-off by Grant at several crucial choke points. Finally, Lee had no option but to surrender. On April 9, 1865, Robert E. Lee surrendered himself and his Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Courthouse, effectively ending the Civil War. Still, in defeat, his soldiers celebrated their general. One wrote to his brother late in the war, \u201cno matter if our country goes down tomorrow Lee\u2019s name will stand first upon the pinnacle of fame, as the greatest of commanders living or dead.\u201d"
"In his study of animals in their natural environment, Lorenz became particularly interested in the way goslings and young ducks followed their parents around soon after they were hatched. From further laboratory studies, Lorenz concluded that goslings had an innate tendency to develop a relationship soon after hatching, with the first large moving object that they came across. Lorenz termed this process of rapid attachment as a result of following, \u2018imprinting\u2019. Lorenz believed the imprinting was irreversible and occurred during a genetically determined time period, which he called the \u2018critical period\u2019."
"Despite her at times belittling language, Moodie does express some respect and appreciation of the Natives\u2019 characteristics, an interest that is non-existent in \u201cHistory Lesson\u201d, however despite her fair mindedness, her opinions are still tinged with racism and an overbearing white \u2013supremacist sentiment. Writing about her experiences in the 1830\u2019s in Canada, Susanna Moodie\u2019s Roughing it in the Bush is an account of life as a female settler at the time."
"The fact that whites do not view themselves in term of race and feel that race is something that blacks solely have to deal with is a division of black and white in itself. When I was a young boy I was constantly reminded of my \u201cblackness\u201d, I have to make it and work as hard as everyone else does because I am black."
"Summary of all: These articles are all about problems having in the agriculture world, things that people think that are destroying our world. Also, I think people are freaking out for no reason this kind of things you need in your life, meat on the table, milk in a cup. All that want has to do with agriculture. The 7 sources I found were farmers having a hard time growing crops, Animal testing, Manure contaminating water, how manure is helping the farmers, How animals have change from back then to now."
"Oliver is the main character who directly represents the orphans at that time; and other characters like the \u201cArtful Dodger (Jack Dawkins)\u201d, \u201cBill Sikes\u201d and \u201cNancy,\u201d play an important role in the book representing different characteristic in society. In the book, Dickens uses sarcasm to expose the cruelty practiced on the innocent children. Also we see the use of pathos in Dickens writing, \u201cIf he could have known that he was an orphan, left tom the tender mercies of churchwardens and oversees, perhaps he would have cried louder."
"A wealthy person has a better opportunity than people who aren\u2019t very wealthy. This can lead to so many ways like lack of education, food and having no shelter. Being poor is not a choice. Those people living in poverty can\u2019t get the help they need and nor help each other. People who are wealthy are happier but that doesn\u2019t mean they are also happy but they can also be greedy sometimes and easy when it comes to judgemental. \u201cPeople who are poor are always looking for problems instead of solutions. They end up blaming their environment, circumstances, jobs, weather, government and will make an extensive list of excuses as to why they cannot be successful. Rich people understand that everything happens for a reason. Rather than letting life happen to them, they take direct action and make big things happen. They put aside all the excuses and eradicate their blame lists because they have to do what must be done (Daniel).\u201d"
"A mother\u2019s love is a blessing every human being is born with. A mother puts her children before anything else, like her own comfort and happiness, working days and nights breaking their backs trying to provide for their family, and waking up on Saturday mornings to smell breakfast being made, making sure one has food on their plate and shelter. Mothers are always there when needed, and can definitely be counted on to get you back up. I owe my mom everything, for all the things that she has done for me and for all the times I\u2019ve made her upset or disappointed."
"When we first meet crooks I thought he waz a nasty man because of hes posture and hes colour of hes skin. But looks can be dece-ving because he turned out to be a very well educated person and also soft hearted. It was very unusal for a black man to read or write in these in these times even so most of the white men could not read or write. I really feel sorry for crooks because he is alll alone and must feel really isolated at times or most of the time. And he has got no company at all and he aint even got no one to talk to at all because hes black. If you ask me I think that is really unacceptable because no one should be left alone for that reason."
"Sites like the KKK seem to promote easier and interactive learning, even if they are racist messages, and because of the credibility accorded to the World Wide Web, users certainly tend to believe in these messages, especially if the users are children and adolescents. The author of the article, Denise M Bostdorff, examined 23 KKK websites over a period of time, and she found that these sites were being used to justify real and actual violence against minorities and others, on the basis of the racist messages being broadcast to users."
"Cassio\u2019s a proper man, Let me see now:To get his place, and to plumpe up my willIn double knavery -How, how?- Let\u2019s see:- \u2026\u201d (1.3.380-384)It is now evident Iago is jealous and wants revenge on both these characters, due to what he feel they have done to him. Iago believes Othello \u2018overlooked\u2019 him and choose Cassio as lieutenant, and Cassio took over him and accepted that position."
"Developed with an advisory committee composed of leaders in the domestic violence field from all over the United States including judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, matrimonial lawyers, battered women\u2019s advocates, medical and health care professionals, law enforcement personnel, educators and others, it has helped to create stronger laws and enforceable legislation. The introduction to the code states: \u201cFamily violence is a wrong that needs righting in every state in this country. The key is community commitment to recognize, address and prevent such violence."
"The holistic approach addresses the needs of the whole person including their, intellectual, spiritual, social, emotional, mental and physical health. Mildred Blaxter (1990) interviewed 10,000 people in a large scale study. From this she defined three standards of peoples understanding of health and wellbeing; a positive definition, regarding health as feeling fit and well. A negative definition regarding health as being free from pain and discomfort and also a functional definition, regarding health in terms of being able to perform certain day to day tasks."
"My overall thoughts of police brutality are getting worse as I read more about it. Innocent and guilty people are being killed because of police officers not being able to control themselves and abusing their power. This made me realize that police brutality is not limited, this is happening all over the globe. People say that police brutality is simply the new wave of publicity it brings. With the media in our favor we can keep the law enforcement in check."
"It is imperative the student discovers the area of needed growth and therefore the teacher must refrain from controlling the conversation. Once the goal is identified for the student it is then time to create a personal plan for change. A student created the improvement plan becomes an intrinsically motivating experience. \u201cNondirective teaching is also related to positive self-esteem and effective feedback in the classroom."
"Secondly, parents can improve a kid\u2019s understanding abilities through reading books and studying with them. Parents who read with their kids are able to question them about what was happening in the story. Also, parent need to take their kids to the library regularly. It motivate their kids to read as many books as possible. Reading can improve a kid\u2019s knowledge and word power."
"If for whatever reason the parents of the foetus refuse to have an abortion and do not want their child, then another option left would be adoption. Adoption gives other people who cannot have children a chance to be parents. This way no one is hurt and the baby still get a chance at life and to make a contribution to the human race. However this may not always be the answer because many of the children who are put up for adoption may have to live, with foster parents or in orphanages."
"The first time I actually started working, was on 9th May and everyone was kind to guide me as I was given things to do. Honestly, it wasn\u2019t my first time to do the work i was doing (washing dishes, ironing, cleaning, mopping, peeling, etc.) because where i am from, from a young age we are taught to do such work, so obviously it was not hard and it felt good doing it for the community."
"Forming an opinion of someone before there is a chance to talk to them or even meet them for the first time is ignorant. Prejudice can come in many forms; however, it is usually associated with negative or hostile feelings about a person or persons simply based on their belonging to a group. Some popular social examples are, people who wear hats while driving are bad drivers, and, older men who have long beards and ride Harley Davidson motorbikes are dangerous."
"Ideology is located in the mind as a set of beliefs and values but is also a product of emotions. It is closely related to political thinking and directs or influences political behavior. Politics is the \u201chome turf\u201d of ideology, and remains its most common referent. Ideologies function to bind individuals to a community and \u201cprovide the individual with a sense of identity and belonging\u201d serving to achieve \u201csocial solidarity and cohesion\u201d (Rejai 1991: 17). Moreover, ideologies are action oriented because they \u201cfurnish guides for action\u201d (McClosky 1964: 362). In fact, it is argued that ideology forms the nexus between ideas and actions, as Mullins () states, \u201cis not that it causes one to do but that it gives one cause for doing."
"You will also need to be prepared to talk with large groups of people, whether it be the students\u2019 parents, other teachers or the general public. Another very important thing about being an early childhood educator is having strong management skills so you can have lesson plans, paperwork and other important documents that are needed to be done in a timely manner, instead of waiting until last moment so you can avoid making any mistakes."
"At 3 Children this age can fully run, climb and ride a bicycle. They can walk upstairs and downstairs on alternate feet. They are bake to use the toilet alone, can talk clearly, undo buttons which is good fine motor skills as they are using their fingers to perform intricate tasks like threading beads etc."
"Tom has always been known for having a good character. He has three kids and a wife that he tries his hardest to care and provide for. The only people who ever said anything bad about Tom was the Ewell family. Tom has always gone to church. The pastor at his church talks highly of him and tries to help the Robinson family through the hard time, for example, \u201cYou all know of Brother Tom Robinson\u2019s trouble. He has been a faithful member of First Purchase since he was a boy. The collection taken up today and for the next three Sundays will go to Helen-his wife, to help her out at home\u201d (160). This shows even the people that go to his church think he\u2019s a good enough man that they decide to help his family out by donating to his family despite being in the middle of the Great Depression. Another person who emphasizes how Tom is a good man is Link Deas, Toms employer. During the trial Link Deas stands up and stresses that Tom has always been a conscientious worker; \u201cThat boy worked for me eight years an\u2019 I ain\u2019t had a speck o\u2019 trouble outta him. Not a speck\u201d (261). What would you do if you were a guy like Tom Robinson walking home and spotted a poor girl in need of help, would you have stopped and aided her struggles? Of course you would. If you are the type of man Tom is you would of helped her despite being cold, poor, or hungry. I fervently believe people like Tom Robinson make our world a better place."
"In \u201cAct One\u201d Linda continuously interrupts Willy, Willy dislikes it. He yells at her, \u201cWill you stop!\u201d (Miller 47). Willy is mean to his wife, but Linda stays calm. My mom, unlike Linda, would not have taken this poor tone or behavior from my dad, she would stand up for herself and say something. My mom understands and notices certain things that my dad, my brother, or I do. Linda does not take enough notice of Willy\u2019s suicidal actions and behavior."
"Historians claim that this fever started the same time colonial mentality seeped into our veins and pointed out that it was widespread by 1572. The colonizers start with the assumption that their ways are inherently superior to those of the colonized. Racist men were put into positions of power where they were expected to promote, first and foremost, the economic and fashion interests of the country\u2019s elite. In the name of God, civilization progress and development, the colonizers justified the most barbaric acts they inflicted on the colonized. The brainwashing committed by the colonizers was meant to tell the imposed that their culture is way behind civilization. They did not know that the acts also made the Filipinos think that lighter skin meant more superior beings."
"The desired effect from Steinbeck may be for the reader to feel sympathy towards Curley\u2019s wife. We learn that Curley\u2019s wife is not an evil figure and only behaves in the way she does, is to grab the attention of the men around her. The other character suffering from severe loneliness throughout the novel is Crooks, the stable buck. He is portrayed to be an intelligent man because \u201che reads alot. \u201d This is alongside Steinbeck\u2019s idea that you don\u2019t have to be intelligent to be rich. But also, Crooks could have been rich if it had not been for the discriminative society that he lived in."
"The Gettysburg Address is a speech that was made by the late President of the United States of America, President Abraham Lincoln. This is one of the speeches that have been mostly or frequently quoted in the history of the United States of America. The Gettysburg address was given by the President when he was taking part in a ceremony which was to mark the dedication of the new cemetery which would be used to inter the soldiers who died in the battle, in Gettysburg in Pennsylvania."
"Lastly, We have the \u201cUninvolved Parenting\u201d style. This is characterized by having basically no involvement in their children\u2019s life. In some extreme instances, not even fulfilling the child\u2019s basic needs. There isn\u2019t any guidance or structure. In my mind this sounds pretty horrible and in some of these cases the child or children would be taken by DHS. Then put into better homes with families that are better suited to care for their needs."
"Without knowing why, [she is] ashamed\u2019. Vanessa is ashamed because Erica saw her as resembling the Australians more than an Asian, but she doesn\u2019t understand when she is just as ridiculed as Erica is. This puts Vanessa in a confusing and upsetting place, not knowing who she is and who she belongs with. She doesn\u2019t understand if she is Asian or aussie, and in her world those seem to be the only two places to fit in."
"According to Baumrid, \u201cAuthoritarian parents are austere, harsh and demanding\u201d she added, \u201cParents are trying to manipulate, mould and teach the children with their own behaviours, not their children\u2019s.\u201d (1968). A study concluded that because of their authoritarian parents, they started drinking alcohol, although they are not classified as binge drinkers (Kusmierski, McDonnell, & Nichols, n.d.)."
"An Inconvenient Truth\u2019 is an Oscar & Nobel Peace Prize winning documentary film that was released in 2006, directed by Davis Guggenheim. It is basically a collection of clips of Al Gore\u2019s environmental speeches that he gave multiple times all over the world. The film begins by explaining the overlap between increases in carbon emissions and increases in global temperature."
"This would serve to support the opposing viewpoint which I intend to refute. To counter that, I will analyze how social pressures and influences play an even more significant role. Some sources that support my claim include \u201cWhy Are Some STEM Fields More Gender Balanced Than Others?\u201d by Sapna Cheryan and \u201cAn Impassioned Call to Action for Gender Equity in STEM\u201d by Linda Sax which examine some of the factors that contribute to the gender gap based on studies. \u201cGender Equality in Preschool STEM Programs as a Factor Determining Russia\u2019s Successful Technological Development\u201d by O.B. Savinskaya is a source from the Russian Education & Society journal that provides a real-life example that has already proven my claim to be correct. To find these sources, I used the Lied Library\u2019s databases focusing on the keywords \u201cgender\u201d and \u201cSTEM\u201d which brought up a wide variety of results. My biggest challenge regarding these sources was narrowing them down to those which focused specifically on the causes of the disparity rather than simply statistics of it or personal experiences. Some of the material was also rather complicated to understand which further narrowed the sources I could use. I have already found some helpful sources, but I could still use more and may need to do some further analysis of the ones I have. As I write my paper, the need may also arise to do deeper research on some subtopics within my main focus. Marinara Murguia"
"Loyalty is the process of giving firm and constant support to someone. Being an affectionate and faithful person shows that he is an honorable person overall. For example, according to Haidt, adaptation evolved both by cultural and biological evolution to make groups to cohere, in part for the purpose of trusting each other, and being more effective at competing with other groups (Haidt 21). A loyal person will be faithful towards their cultural and biological groups, so they can stay loyal to their friends and family. If you are a loyal person, people will respect you much so more because they know that they can trust you to stay with them through thick and thin. In comparison, when playing on a basketball team, being faithful and affectionate towards your teammates is necessary to be successful when playing a team sport. For example, when playing a team sport like basketball, you must stay loyal to your teammates to earn their respect as a teammate. It is important to stay loyal to your team because when your team is on a losing streak, they need your support and help. When you are winning, you stay loyal to keep encouraging and helping with your team. To be loyal, you must respect your teammates, and your teammates will respect you. Being a loyal person is crucial to gaining someone\u2019s trust. If they cannot trust you, they will not respect you as a person. Loyalty is important to society because if you are affectionate and faithful to someone, they can build a sense of trust with you and appreciate your loyalty."
"This is an assignment paper on drama as a form of psychotherapy among children with special needs.This paper discuss the history of drama therapy,steps,techniques and strategies involved in the therapy, role of a therapist, benefits to the general population and benefits to the particular group in this case children with autism.This paper also contains a personal reflection of the benefits of a drama therapy among children with autism."
"This as mentioned in the cited Morse document, coincides with what Morse goes on to say in regard to the regulation of criminal activity. Morse states \u201cBecause the regulating criminal activity is primarily the responsibility of the states, many scholars perceive the rapid expansion of the federal criminal law as clashing with federalism values\u201d (Morse, 2009). To date the original funding of all aspects of the Adam Walsh Act is still in place and is to be revisited and potentially revised in 2014. Those who declare portions of the act unconstitutional, such as in Morse\u2019s report cited, now have the opportunity to voice concerns and suggestions."
"But the toxicology test on which regulators rely to gather this information are stuck in a time warp, and are largely based on wasteful and often poorly predictive animal experiments\u201d (Abbott). Abbott talks about a legislation called REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals) and how it planned to \u201cmake registration mandatory for both future and existing chemicals \u2013 even those that have been on the market for decades\u201d (Abbott). As a result of reach, it was expected that millions more animals would be used in order to meet the necessary requirements. 5,000 animals \u2013 that is up to how many test subjects could be used for each chemical; if it is a pesticide that number jumps to 12,000. The estimated cost of running these tests on the unregistered (approximately 30,000) chemicals is between \u20ac5 billion (US$6 billion) and \u20ac10 billion (US$13 billion) (Abbott). In order to test one single chemical for cancer causing potential, it takes five years, involves 400 rats (each of which is treated with the maximum tolerated dose), and more than 50% of the results are positive, even worse, of that 50%, 90% are false positives (Abbott)."
"The information provided by the author of this reading is concise and talks about the adverse physiological and psychological effects of screen time on children due to the extended use of the digital technologies. It highlights, Pre-adolescents and young people are represented to experience rest issues particularly when they use propelled media on night as well as evenings. Colossal number of electronic contraptions in higher money related status families could be consigned for adding to extended screen introduction and shorter rest time. Rest time access to media contraptions relates to dealt rest portions of various age ranges. The writer explains that the period of use of modernized media during the evening and night time prologue to unbelievable light and blue light transmitted without any other individual\u2019s information shining contraptions may cover melatonin age.

"Children have a right to privacy and they have a right to support. As service providers, we must always remain sensitive to our client\u2019s needs, and if a child is suspected to have some questions, workers should be very careful about how they proceed. The last thing anyone wants to do is traumatize a child more, by simply being unaware of the proper procedures. It is also good to remember that personal opinions and religious beliefs should have no bearing on how a child is addressed. Children are human beings and deserve the same care and respect, no matter their gender, race, religious belief, or sexuality."
"Ultimately, whether a mother chooses to breastfeed in public or not is her decision, but babies were born to breastfeed and mothers should be able to nurse their babies anytime and anywhere without stares, negative comments, or judgement from others. When society finally gets on board with the idea that breast are meant to feed infants and that breastfeeding in public is as natural as eating a sandwich or drinking coffee, future generations will flourish as they will likely consume more nutrients and grow up with a healthy understanding of the function of women\u2019s breast."
"George and Lennie cherish one common dream: they want to acquire their own land, grow their crops there, take care of living creatures, and most importantly \u2013 Lennie wants to grow and feed rabbits. But for this, they need to earn money. That\u2019s why they are looking for a new California ranch, where they will be given shelter and work because certain circumstances forced them to leave their previous place of work. In this episode, Steinbeck acts as a fancy fisherman. At the beginning of the story, he puts the bait on the hook, only casually mentioning that friends have to leave their previous place of work soon; then throws this bait, telling the story in the previous city, when Lennie was attracted by the red dress of one girl and decided to touch it without any sexual overtones, but was accused of rape; and after that he skillfully cuts by accompanying his story with an event with the wife of Curley on the farm."
"Be that as it may, by what method can three ladies be brought up in a similar circumstance and turn out so in an unexpected way? One conceivable response to this inquiry is on the grounds that Cordelia is Lear\u2019s most loved little girl. Lear\u2019s inclination towards Cordelia is presumably what prompts Regan and Goneril\u2019s character blemishes. Myra Glazer Schotz states, \u201cconcentrating on the \u2018manly problem of sovereignty and parenthood,\u2019 the Lear world presents us with little girls however predicates itself on the nonappearance of their mom, the nonattendance of a Queen, the nonattendance of a ladylike guideline to go about as emblematic and mental balance to male specialist\u201d (Davidson 47). In spite of the fact that the Kent and the Fool are there to check Lear\u2019s power, they don\u2019t as much impact his better half would. Kent prompts against Cordelia\u2019s expulsion yet is then himself expelled. Lear\u2019s better half, the mother of his little girls, is most likely the special case who could have kept Cordelia\u2019s expulsion."
"Among these determinants is the presence or absence of an intimate partner (dannenbeck 1995); the size and functioning of family relationships, particularly parent-child bonds (kaufman and uhlenberg 1998) The purpose of present study was to find out difference of loneliness between only child and child having siblings. Method Participants A total of 90 students (24 boys, 66 girls) aged over eighteen to twenty five years were selected from six different departments of the Islamia University of Bahawalpur. Purposive sampling technique was employed for selecting participants."
"While same sex relationships garner most of the attention, domestic partnerships are not always between members of the same sex. California Family Code Section 297 defines domestic partners as \u201ctwo adults who have chosen to share one another\u2019s lives in an intimate and committed relationship of mutual caring. To establish a domestic partnership in California, a couple must file a Declaration of Domestic Partnership with the Secretary of the State, share a common residence, not be married or in a domestic partnership with someone else, not be related by blood, both are over the age of 18, both are the same sex, or opposite sex over the age of 62 and meet the eligibility criteria under the Social Security Act."
"The hate he feels for Antonio is so immense that makes us question to what extent he is actually rational at all. Throughout the development of the plot he seems to hold so many negative values that it is impossible not to make a connection between his character and the fact that he is a Jew. Just like Marlowe, Shakespeare makes the fact that he is Jewish the root of all evil, as from that very fact all the other negative traits arise. As Bloom mentions in his essay, Shylock is a walking nightmare, and that should be the only way that anyone portrays him. As we can see from his speeches, he clearly has a great love for his wealth and he is not jeopardizing his financial position for any reason. It is not a coincidence that when Jessica runs away with his money, he mostly worries about his wealth and not so much about his daughter. Also, the fact that Jessica had to run away shows that Shylock is far from an ideal father. His speeches also show that he has an extremely negative attitude towards Christians that he justifies as the retaliation for all the anti-Semitism he has faced. He seems very resentful towards the people that have acted in a bad way towards him and as I mentioned earlier, especially Antonio. So, his actions are mainly driven by his rage and what he thinks as retribution."
"To become pregnant due to a rape or incest act is a horribly violent crime but abortion can never be justified. the unborn entity is not when its presence does not endanger its mother\u2019s life as in the case of a tubal pregnancy .it is the rapist who is the aggressor. the unborn entity is just as much an innocent victim as it is the mother. for that reason abortion cannot be justified on the basis that the unborn is an aggressor."
"When Heart of darkness first come out in 1899 (serialised in Blackwood\u2019s magazine) it was in an age where the western world was scrambling to colonise many African countries, where England was fighting a second Boer war and were supreme in North Africa, and it was a time when Joseph Conrad was putting his reputation and respect as an author on the table. His contemporaries could easily have dismissed his book as modernistic drivel and slated him for his uncontemporary views."
"For example, soldiers on a mission in a primarily Islamic country may have to stop and search a female native at a checkpoint. Diversity amongst the troops makes it likely that at least one person has had experience with that situation, whether they have been a member of that faith or just know the customs and courtesies of that population. This experience allows the search to proceed with the proper precautions to not offend or cause hostility and non-compliance. In that case, the decision that a female soldier would search is likely, considering the different social laws regarding the sexes. Dealing with these situations tactfully requires the multitude of viewpoints that diversity provides. This is why \u201cwe need teams of people who think differently from one another and yet are joined together in common cause\u201d1."
"\u201cCongress, which has the exclusive power to create new paths to citizenship yet has failed repeatedly to pass legislation that would enable childhood arrivals while earning some form of legal immigration status and grant citizenship of the country\u201d (Dassault 151). \u201cDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program provides young immigrants who arrived or stayed in the U.S. without legal permission temporary protection from deportation and the ability to qualify for work authorization anywhere is the U.S.\u201d \u201cChildren lacking legal immigration status have the same constitutional right as citizens\u201d (Dassault 151). As a result, unauthorized illegal parents cannot acquire lawful status to pass on to their children.

"The act consists of many distinct problems that have wished attention. for example, it additionally authorizes troubles relating to mental fitness care, women veterans, rural fitness upgrades, and research and education.

"The emergence of hip-hop in popular culture has lead to a younger generation of Britons adopting a similar fashion taste and speaking the same language in the form of colloquial speech, this has only challenged the characteristics attributed with a sense of identity. The evolution of new ethnic identities, suggests that the notion of a shared \u2018black\u2019 identity has \u2018evaporated\u2019 in contemporary society, whilst a shared \u2018black\u2019 identity provides a based for political change, it constructs an idea of a homogeneous social group. The notions of a shared \u2018black\u2019 identity developed out of the collective experience of oppression and disadvantage."
"It is a store house of knowledge. It is actually a wonderful gift to human. In a word, it helps us in many ways. It guides us when we become confused. It helps us in decision making. When we remain lonely, it educates, entertains and serves us like a great companion. When we are in sorrow, book consoles us. It helps us in the spread of our progressive views."
"Migrants contribute to the economic development of a country in many ways, such as, fulfilling labor force shortages, investing in the economy, and supporting international trade through knowledge of overseas marketing strategies, business networks, and cultural integration. Immigration results in an open global market, giving a general perspective to the social and economic growth of society, thus, increase the horizon of development (Australian Human Rights Commission 2005). Employed immigrants nvariably increase the nation\u2019s wealth by intensifying competition and expanding the distribution of employment. As the immigrant\u2019s income increases, more demand is made for products and services beyond the basics, thus, immigrants bring an effective boost to the economy (Boudreaux 2000). According to the World Bank (2010); developing countries received US$325 billion remittances in 2010, not much over US$316 received in 2009, but are likely to increase by 6. 2% in 2011 and 8. 1% by 2012 due to economic development by migration."
"While answering her thought on the etiology of her illness Aleya claimed that she was married at an early age in a joint family where she had to do plenty of hard labour which ultimately caused her illness. At her in laws she would bend over to clean the yard and nearby space of the house which would take up to two hours every day."
"However, identity thieves can still use the old methods for obtaining personal information. Common methods are stealing wallets or mails, looking through residential trashcans or business dumpsters, posing as someone legally permitted to access personal information such as credit reports, or bribing their way to get the information (Newman, et. al. 2005). A phishing scam is another method of getting personal information out of a person. The Anti-Phishing Workgroup indicated that there are only 4,564 phishing websites in July 2005 but the number increased to 23,670 as of July 2006."
"Notwithstanding, globalization of businesses has led to the mass exodus of people. Corporations are setting basis in different corners of the planet. This demands exporting of human capital to tend to the ground issues as well as set pace for and advance the organizational business culture. For instance, Google Corporation established basis in China and had to move a sizeable number of its employees (Gavrilova, 2011). These employees moved with their families and settled in China."
"I have an experience with the football when I was in the match and it was an important match, and I was using the most important strong point in me and what is was patience I am so patient and I have confidence and I believe in God, and what makes me patience and confidence in the life conditions that happened to me, in my opinion, football need many of patience, the game condition will not be with you every time, but you should be patient. For example, you are in a match and the result is 0-0 after 70 minutes and the team try to have goals and attack the game but they don\u2019t have a good chance but in the 90 minutes they get a winning goal and that shows that the team did not give up and they struggled to the last moment."
"My father was born from a very simple family. The house he occupies with his parents and siblings can be said to be far from worthy at that time when compared to the homes of families who live around my father\u2019s house, the income of his parents is only able to eat everyday with his family."
"The Liberal Government of 1906 to 1914 introduced free school meals, old age pensions for those aged 70, national insurance and limited unemployment benefits. However the present Welfare State and its principles have their origin in the Labour Government of 1945 to 1951. The Beveridge Report of 1942 is significant in the development of the Welfare State."
"Daniel, who was always mistaken for a gangster was finally fed up with it. As he was fixing the locks of Farhad\u2019s store, Farhad calls him a cheater because he thought Daniel didn\u2019t do his job. Daniel doesn\u2019t take the money from Farhad and leaves, having done his job properly, yet Farhad believes that Daniel is a liar. Not only do the victims stand up for themselves but the offenders also realize the grave mistake they were making by judging people based on their looks."
"There seems to be two existing worlds, one of the lower class, and the other the middle class, this seems to create an invisible barrier between the two worlds. The children and the boy are all jealous, jealousy works both ways. The middle class boy wants to change his life, he see\u2019s the bully\u2019s to be free, though he is not, and they see him to have everything he\u2019s ever wanted, but either way no ones happy, he wants to spend a day in their shoes."
"One of Aristotle\u2019s most influential works is the Nicomachean Ethics, which is where he presents the well-studied theory of happiness. Throughout Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle asked, \u201cWhat is the ultimate purpose of human existence?\u201d (Aristotle) He realized that everyone has an end point or a main goal that we should direct some time towards. Aristotle argues that happiness is the end goal; he further explained how it\u2019s easy to say we desire money, pleasure, and honor since we believe that these goods will make us happy. Therefore, when you feel happy for a short time it is not happiness at all; it a pleasurable moment."
"They are non-judgemental. They are not racist or homophobic; they welcome diversity as enriching a society and do not judge people on the colour of their skin, age religion or sexual orientation. Participation in the community -Getting involved in neighbourhood watch, community fund raising and environmental campaigns Awareness of the needs of fellow people in your community -Good citizens have awareness that we are not all the same and that some people need more support due to poverty, disability or language issues. A good citizen is aware and sensitive to these issues and help to provide a supportive inclusive community which values all of its members."
"Individuals make decisions based off of fairness and loyalty, according to Jonathan Haidt\u2019s 2008 TED Talk titled \u201cThe Morals of Liberal and Conservatives\u201d. Reciprocity is when you are being an honest and honorable person that can be trusted by others. Loyalty is when you give firm and constant support to someone or something. If you practice reciprocity and are a loyal person in today\u2019s society, you will be highly respected as a person."
"These jobs continued for a year, with Mason gradually increasing his wealth and power. He was able to buy a car, eat exquisite foods and dress in the finest clothes. Eventually becoming Duncan\u2019s right hand man because of his trustworthiness. However, this still left Lady Mason unsatisfied, she wanted to live a life of extreme luxury and to be exuberantly handed anything she wanted. To accomplish Lady Mason started encouraging Mason to take out Duncan Escobar."
"The presence of racism is the main cause of every conflict that occurs in the movie. The majority of the racism involved in the movie is towards the negro population. They are perceived as thugs, thieves and murderers. In the beginning of the movie, two black friends, Anthony and Peter, are walking in a strictly \u201cwhite\u201d neighbourhood feeling discriminated as they chat amongst themselves, being racist towards white people. They mention how they are seen from a white person\u2019s point of view and at that moment, Jean Cabot and her husband walk towards their car."
"However, if we could see through their inner being, it would tear us apart to see the tears flowing. Inner sadness with an outward glow is not happiness. People who have the potential to make you feel relaxed and at ease, are those whom you should keep within your circle."
"Because of recent shootings, federal gun control laws have been put in place to control gun violence, but has it worked? In this essay I will discuss the reasons why these gun control laws fail to do what they are intended to do: prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands. Even though social media may portray that gun control is the \u201csuperior solution\u201d to gun violence, it only leads to more conflict between the National Rifle Association and legislature. Gun laws are ineffective because of illegal gun trafficking and the criminal behavior following a gun restriction."
"The Supreme Court ruling, which reaffirmed the second amendment, protects gun ownership rights regardless of their membership to the state militia (La Valle 1). Previous court rulings do not prohibit gun control laws but easily challenge their constitutionality. Many legal systems recognize self-defense as a right, but permit citizens to use handguns for purposes prescribed by law. The case has only opened up floodgates of litigations in state and lower federal courts with more litigations certain until the parameters become clearer (La Valle 1). Legislators evade discussions about gun control, especially where Bill Clinton strong-armed leaders into voting for the laws that cost most legislators their jobs. Democrats are aware of the move from making gun control a major plank in their domestic policy."
"We also cleaned the Children\u2019s Home compound; we had to rake the leaves from an old tree that shed daily. We had to water the vegetables that they had planted around the compound. We had pick litter around the compound and sweep. This was done after every two days. We washed the corridors around the kitchen, the office, and the library. The library had to be cleaned and the books on the shelves arranged well. In the library; we also had to clean the chairs, the tables, and the large windows. I also washed the seat covers of the sofas in the library. The children had their study time from 10 am to 12 pm. We had the chance to tutor them once they closed school for the holidays. We taught them Mathematics, English, and Science."
"My mom is the most amazing person I\u2019ve ever met. She has been through so much since her mom passed away. She kept a positive outlook on life while growing up and despite all the anger she had and still has, she doesn\u2019t let it get the best of her. She is an amazing mom and wife. She will go to hell and back for us, she is constantly on the run, taking us to doctors, practice, work, school, the list goes on and on. She is the definition of what a mother is and should be. She taught herself how to be a mom, she is loving, she is empathetic, warming. She\u2019s my best friend, I have no idea what I\u2019d do without her. She\u2019s exactly the type of mother I want to be when I become one. I know my grandma is smiling down at her in amazement, she is so proud of the woman my mom became."
"Telemakhos and the speaker in the poem by McDonald share similar experiences. They both are dealing with the absence of their fathers who both partook in the military. However, the speaker in the poem actually knows for a fact his father has died, which may be why he copes with the lack of a father better than Telemakhos, solely because he does not need to question whether or not his father isn\u2019t in his life due to sheer carelessness. Because Telemakhos hasn\u2019t the faintest idea of his father\u2019s whereabouts, he is in search for closure, not only for himself, but for his mother and property being destroyed by the savage suitors. Their circumstances are what control the tone in their dialog, allowing the reader to feel the same things the speakers are feeling."
"2. Apparently Amber did not use a birth control method. If she had, what options did she have and how do the various methods work.\u00a0Amber had many options of birth control. There is only one preventative measure with 100% fail proof ratings and this is abstinence. If two consenting individuals decide to engage in sexual activities, there are many options to prevent pregnancy. Barrier methods, such as female condoms and male condoms are probably the most cost effective for birth control (Women\u2019s Health 2011). The rate of effectiveness relies on many conditions, whether the condom is still good because they do have an expiration date, if they have been damaged, if the correct lubricant is used or not. Oil based lubricants breakdown the materials causing damage to the condom (WebMD 2013)."
"The next morning is a completely different atmosphere, it changes from a scene from a traditional horror story of a noisy and scary outside and a silent dark solemn depressing inside to the scene of brightness and happiness at a typical Victorian family breakfast table as a \u2018wintery sun streamed over the breakfast table\u2019 The new atmosphere leaves the family thinking about the way they got caught up in the story the night before and allowing it to scare them silly. Mrs. White especially thinks that the fear of the night before was ridiculous saying even if the wish was granted \u201chow could money hurt you\u201d little does she know, it can and it\u2019s using dramatic irony. Not believing in it didn\u2019t prevent her from \u2018scurrying to the door at the postman\u2019s knock\u2019 with a hint that she\u2019s hopeful something exciting will still happen, and the money will still come."
"In the 1860s, post-Civil War era, Ann Reeves Jarvis, a women\u2019s activist, was able to get a small West Virginia town to partake in a celebration for all mothers of Confederate and Union soldiers. This gathering was called \u201cMother\u2019s Work Days.\u201d The idea of Mother\u2019s Day stood for peace and reconciliation. It was not until 1908 when Mother\u2019s Day started to become an observed holiday to many states.

"In some cases the chauffeur is not instructed properly about the place, or the specialist forgets to utilize the manifest and etc. Moreover, 10-20% of the of the time the technician learnt that they have actually been given the incorrect part in the warehouse, which usually causes a reschedule with the customer, while sometimes the customer might simply cancel their order in favor of the competitor."
"Kincaid\u2019s view in A Small Place reflects a Caribbean perspective, which is one of disgust towards the Europeans. While they felt as if they were doing the natives a favor by coming in and teaching them their culture, Kincaid believes that the Europeans stripped many Caribbean\u2019s of their culture, including the Antiguans."
"Susan Reeve, a self-esteem expert and author of The Inspired Life: Unleashing Your Mind\u2019s Capacity for Joy, says that unfortunately, many people haven\u2019t even started on the road to self-actualization. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand how the brain works, the creative process, and that everything that exists begins inside and then is brought to form outside,\u201d she says \u201cMost people suffer from low self-esteem and do not believe in themselves- they feel unworthy, unloved, and are ashamed of these feelings. Their fears, worries, and anxieties stop them in their\u00a0tracks. They give more credence to the opinion of others and fail to honor their inner knowing.\u201d To self-actualize is to discover and cultivate one\u2019s own personal potential. Being all you can be. \u201cBut often people aren\u2019t actively actualizing because they are focused on survival, or getting their basic emotional needs met\u201d (Maslow). In order to self-actualize, you\u2019re lower needs must first be met- as per Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of needs."
"Thus, the best solution is to improve sexual education, which would include medically accurate information on abstinence and contraception. Abstinence is a great way to avoid a pregnancy, but not many people choose to live without sex. Therefore, contraception is necessary to bypass conception. Even though we have a great variety of contraceptives and easier access to them now then 30 years ago, there are still countless number of unplanned pregnancies. Part of the problem is due to the over-sexualized media which has an attitude of casual sex with multiple partners being okay. The results of casual sex are ignorance, pregnancy and abortion."

"Plastic is very harmful for environment- once we use it, it will be thrown away \u2013it then goes to the waste collection centre where it takes 500-1000 or more years for it be completely destroyed. Some people throw it to the ocean- when turtles eats it thinking its jellyfish, it kills them. It takes a lot of money and energy to destroy plastic bags, therefore, instead of plastic bags, choose to use paper bags. What else can we do?"
"For the duration of their friendship Madame Zeroni and Elya Yelnats had a candid and attentive correlation, from which they received advice, guidance, assistance and companionship. Madame Zeroni was elderly and lonesome, and Elya revelled in her stories and wisdom, accordingly he told her of his troubles though none were more perturbing to him than that of Myra Menke. When Elya had seen Myra he fell profoundly in love with her, despite the fact that Myra was beautiful she was also extremely imprudent but nevertheless Elya refused to acknowledge this. Elya had nothing to offer in exchange for her hand and was exceedingly distressed."
"Soon, the Populists were pointing fingers at their old friends as the root of the social evils plaguing the South. The warring southern political figures saw Blacks as a common ground for agreement and reconciliation between themselves and therefore held Blacks as responsible for political and economic turmoil. It was a period of immense white hostility towards blacks and thus around this time, racial separation began to pick pace in the Southern United States."
"George and\u00a0Lennies friendship grows stronger and stronger and it grows so strong that even the part when George kills him is a sign of caring. I believe that George has always wanted the best for Lennie and he knew that Lennie would either be tortured in the end or get killed anyways. When George kills Lennie, it is in my belief that this is the biggest act of respect and love towards Lennie. George never wants to see Lennie get hurt, so this is the only way he can let Lennie live a happy life without getting hurt inside. If I were George I would do the exact same thing. It\u2019s tough letting go of a friend, but sometimes it in the best interest of your friend. The last circumstance that showed a great friendship was when George said \u201cWe gonna get a little place (pg. 105). This showed that George wanted to settle down and live with Lennie for the rest of his life. George and Lennie had such a great friendship that they both wanted to live and know each other forever."
"Hofstede\u2019s analysis is done by country. While this is valid for many countries, it does not hold in the countries where there are strong subcultures that are based on ethnicity of origin or geography. In Canada, for instance, there is a distinct French Canadian culture that has quite a different set of norms compared to English-speaking Canada. And in Italy, masculinity scores would differ between North and South. Key Points:Cultural norms play a large part in the mechanics and interpersonal relationships at work."

"Nevertheless the encounter between the different groups in her writing is peaceful, intriguing and certainly not as disastrous as in \u201cHistory Lesson\u201d.

"Therefore, this results in America\u2019s view of immigrants to be mostly due to the pre-existing immigrants living in the United States. \u2018This is also supported by the article Camarota, Steven A, and Jessica M.

"Also, because of family conflict, youth may feel as if they cannot talk to their parents about their difficulties and therefore have nobody to support them through this challenging time. This can cause them to feel defeated and believe themselves to be inadequate in their capabilities. As a result, feelings of guilt and shame can arise, which in turn can cause them to have a consistent negative outlook and continuously cause them to believe that they will fail. It is important to recognize the impact of feeling of powerlessness as it can significantly affect the ability of the newcomer youth to transition successfully (Situational Transitions Class Notes, 2012) into their new culture."
"Shylock is a wealthy Jewish moneylender in Venice. He lends Antonio three thousand ducats on the promise that if it is not repaid, the forfeiture shall be a pound of Antonio\u2019s flesh. By placing a pound of flesh as\u00a0collateral, Shylock is able to envision his revenge all too clearly. By eliminating Antonio, Shylock will not only fuel his thirst for vengeance but would also eliminate his leading competition. Antonio by lending money at no interest had thwarted Shylock in his bid to acquire even more gold, which he valued more than anything else. So when Antonio defaults on his loan, Shylock relentlessly demands absolute compliance with the terms of the agreement."

"Atticus\u2019 refusal to give in to the ways of other parents and his persistence in teaching his children to be the most respectful people that they can be, prove that he is a quality parent.

"In spite of the saying \u201cparents are always right\u201d they are not always right. If you look at the divorce rate it has more then doubled. And they say that it doesn\u2019t hurt the children. If they really look at it, it tares the children apart. There sense of safety is gone, shattered. They are unable to trust anybody. Some people don\u2019t see this. They see the face that the children put on so they can\u2019t see the way that they are feeling."
"Although racial inequality is one of the least talked about issues in America today, there\u2019s a majority of people who support the subject, To take action in this project I created a Facebook page titled \u201cRacial Inequality\u201d which is encouraging others to help spread awareness of the subject as well as urging them to see no color and look past a person\u2019s skin, After promoting the page and sharing it with family and friends, it received over 40 supporters within the first day and is continuing to receive more, After doing some research I discovered there are many different races that face some sort of discrimination or injustice, The four different groups focused on in this project are Native Americans, African Americans, Muslims, and Hawaiians."

"What I Liked About this Book and Why?I enjoyed the humour displayed in the book. The BFG speaks in an uneducated funny way. The names of the giants, certain food items (e.g. snozzcumbers), and places are laughable. The BFG and Sophie comment on passing gas (whizzpoppers), and the like. I was laughing so much that it was difficult to take breaks while reading."
"It thinks it is an old, dead and extinct slogan, just as FDR is extinct as president, which cannot be restored again. The reason why Americans did not receive much support after the depression from Hoover was because of his view that America should exercise \u2018rugged individualism. \u2018 This is looking after ones own without having any support from the government and putting forward their own effort and hard work to achieve success. Hoover believed that if he left the country to restore itself it would without having to have any support given to them."
"Gender role discrimination may be considered by many to be nonexistent to today\u2019s society and that equality between the sexes has been achieved. Gender roles and relations still play a part in perpetuating inequality, and the effects of gender roles in relation to childhood, family life and at work. (Janedoe146, 2010) Over the last 30 years companies as well as society have begun to recognize that the nature of jobs, the workplace environment, and more generally, the culture of the workplace can have a significant impact on the ability of workers to balance their work and family lives."

"Romeo and Juliet shows this as well as it could possibly be shown. It\u2019s clear that the four novels show extremely different forms of friendship and trust. Yet they all thoroughly presented aspects that are equally important in fully understanding the concepts. Whether it\u2019s risking your life for your friend, saving a life as a Juror that trusted that the man could be innocent, trusting one\u2019s self, or accepting the fact that sometimes things are out of your control. Trust and friendship shouldn\u2019t be just a figment of books we read, it should be an ongoing theme in our every day lives."

"Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, known as Mahatma Gandhi, was born in Porbandar, a coastal town in present-day Gujarat, India, on 2 October 1869. His father, Karamchand Gandhi (1822-1885), who belonged to the Hindu Modh community, was the diwan (Prime Minister) of the eponymous Porbander state, a small princely state in the Kathiawar Agency of British India. His grandfather\u2019s name was Uttamchand Gandhi fondly called as Utta Gandhi. His mother, Putlibai, who came from the Hindu Pranami Vaishnava community, was Karamchand\u2019s fourth wife, the first three wives having apparently died in childbirth. Growing up with a devout mother and the Jain traditions of the region, the young Mohandas absorbed early the influences that would play an important role in his adult life; these included compassion to sentient beings,"
"As Said points out in Orientalism (1978)\u201dsince the orient was a sub race he had to be subjected it was that simple\u201d (207). In his work Orientalism (1978) Said deals with the concept of the Orient as the other of the West: inferior, alien and conquerable.Occident and Orient becomes the relationship of power, of domination, of varying degree of a complex hegemony. Although the geographical line between the West and East is an imaginary and artificial one, the acceptance of this binary opposition with the former as privileged and the latter as unprivileged is taken for granted by the Western scholars. Orientalism as a Western narrative about the Orient is guilty of legitimizing civilizing mission, essentialism (absolutely necessary, extremely important) expansionism (the doctrine of expanding the territory or economic influence) and imperialism (a policy of extending your rule over foreign countries ) and on the other hand, convincing natives of their own inferiority."
"Migration is the movement of people across a specified boundary for the purpose of establishing a new or semi-permanent residence. External migration is where residences change between a residential unit in the Demographic Surveillance Systems (DSA) with one outside it, and internal migration is where residences change from one residential unit to another in the same DSA (Indepth 2008). Migration is a process of civilians moving from one region to another region by some push and pull factors. Certain push and pull factors like brain drain, racism, better living standards and higher chances of employment cause a particular person to migrate."
"It\u2019s important to recognise that Crooks is one of the most judged and prejudiced people on this ranch. The ranch is located in california, where even there, all African Americans were looked down on as lower class citizens. We can see this, as Crooks is separated from everyone else. It also doesn\u2019t help that Crooks also has a disability: \u201cgot a crooked back where a horse kicked him\u201d"
"\u2019. I will go about this by examining the words, thoughts and actions of the characters that the authors have created. I will also examine the social attitudes of the time period in which the stories were written and how they relate to the theme of childhood in both stories. The Trout is about a 12 year old girl called Julia who when exploring finds a trout in a well."
"Albert Bandura \u2018s Social Cognitive Theory says that personal factors, such as ideas, feelings and desires, interact with erudite behaviour forms and societal influences to bring forth inclinations to move in a peculiar manner ( McMahn, 2009 ) . Charles Manson had every chance to detect what non to make in societal state of affairss and really few opportunities to detect socially acceptable interactions."
"4-1. The Army has its own customs, both official and social. Some have been handed down from the distant past while others are of comparatively recent origin. Those customs that endure stand on their own merits. As a long established social organization, the Army observes a number of customs that add to the interest, pleasure, and graciousness of Army life."
"This thesis explores urban poverty and the coping strategies of the urban poor in the slums areas of Adama. It seeks to make a contribution to understanding and analysis of the phenomenon of rapid mass urbanization and its social consequences, the formation of huge urban slums and new forms of urban poverty. Its focus is the analysis of poverty which has been overwhelmingly dominated by economic approaches to the neglect of the social questions arising from poverty."
"The inspiration of coloring material can come from the physical visual aspect of the metropolis every bit good as emotion and vision of the metropolis harmonizing to color psychological science. Colour pallet for DEMA was inspired by Edinburgh and its environing countries. For illustration, the coloring material slate is from architecture outside while ruddy represent the screen of books for visionary. For Foshan, green as the chief coloring material seen on the route can be used in showing the relaxing and comfy life ; orange is a coloring material for energy and bravery of invention which used a batch in street events ; slated-color as the coloring material for our care foring history and civilization."
"Section 12: The State recognizes the sanctity of family life and shall protect and strengthen the familyas a basic autonomous social institution. It shall equally protect the life of the mother andthe life of the unborn from conception. The natural and primary right and duty of parentsin the rearing of the youth for civic efficiency and the development of moral character shallreceive the support of the Government."
"Except that this time it was not so much a matter of attaching oneself to a living symbol of being uprooted in the native ground; it was more a matter of preparing to be uprooted, to be spirited away into some transparent yet indigenous afterlife. (Heaney)By resembling the chest-nut tree with his mother, Heaney named the poem as The Wishing Tree, from the title itself one could conceive the fact that he has deliberately granted the wishing to the tree so as to stress on its disposition of fulfilling the wishes, just as mother did to all of her children out of motherly affection. The first line of the poem unmistakably brings into attention the likeness between the tree and his mother: I thought of her as the wishing tree that died (Heaney)So the first initial prospect that compels the poet to express the similarity/ resemblance/ similitude is nothing but death- both have died for a certain cause. What makes Heaney to remember his mother while unearthing the tree is its last moment in the celestial world? He witnessed both of them to breathe their last moment. He remembered perfectly the event of transplanting with wishing tree from its rightful place:And saw it lifted, root and branch, to heaven,Trailing a shower of all that had been driven,(Heaney)This act of up-lifting is further enhanced with the phrase lifted to heaven, in a way confirming/ reaffirming the death of the tree."
"In addition, he also referred to this resemblance as the \u201creason for the desire of one friends to fight a difficult battle for the other\u201d (Van Duzee, 1963). This is the reason why, in international relations, friendship is an important foundation among allies. As it is provided by Roschchin (n. d. ), \u201cfriendship indeed facilitates attempts at structuring an anarchic multitude\u201d. Friendship is very important among various cultures. As it is observed by one"
"Some Members wondered about the timing and effectiveness of Malaysia\u2019s capital and exchange control measures implemented in the wake of the Asian crisis and the pegging of the ringitt to the U.S. dollar, measures that Malaysia saw as appropriate for stabilizing markets and building confidence. Members expressed the hope that \u201ctemporary\u201d liberalization measures introduced during the review period would be made \u201cpermanent\u201d. Members also sought Malaysia\u2019s views on the need to diversify its exports, nearly half of which involve electronics. Members commended Malaysia for its strong support for and commitment to the multilateral trading system, and expressed their hope that it would actively participate in the Doha Development Agenda."
"Resources endowment is another factor than fuels migration in the modern world. People tend to move from areas where the resources are in less supply to where they are in large supply. For instance, human pressure on available in Britain had led the government to engage in bilateral consensus with such governments as the Australian where lands are in excess supply (Economist). Besides, American scholars are migrating from the over concentrated academic institutions in United States to the short supplied in academicians institutions in Europe."
"Nowadays, friendship usually appears to be good, but a kinship is always the best bond. A friendship can be a great connection in life, but it takes time to adapt to it and cultivate a good relationship. Kinship is more valuable than friendship because relatives give an unconditional support and accept their relative\u2019s differences. First relationships between relatives are less superficial and more trustworthy than friend\u2019s relationship. Relatives are in all rough times with their family. For example, my mother and I support each other in all aspects and hard situations."
"She could be holding the bird protectively as if the bird flies away, so would her life. The beak of the bird is slightly touching her lips, which might also suggest that she is kissing her life goodbye. Another thought about the beak touching her lips could be that because a dove symbolizes peace, her lips taste the freedom as she now enters her everlasting, peaceful rest. In the Classical Greek time, many of the steles would have the child\u2019s favorite pet. In this case, the girl\u2019s favorite pets might have been her doves. Perhaps the sculpture of the girl holding the two birds is simply a farewell to her favorite pets."
"Racism features strongly in the novel Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck. I think Steinbeck manages to sum up every thing that was wrong with racism and American culture of the time, whilst keeping his views to himself. Steinbeck decided not to write either for or against racism, he just gave you a few scenarios for you the reader to decide whether it was ethical, I think this was very effective as it provokes a response in the reader and also coincides with the plot and time that the story was written."
"My father received a business opportunity and had to relocate, so I have no choice but to move along with him. I was terrified at the idea of abandoning everything to start over and frustrated by the way that this all occurred against my will. Adapting to the new school system was not the difficult part, it was losing important friends and teacher that was the hardest."
"This shows that Lennie lacks the mental strength to question George, and the will to defy George and socialise with fellow ranch workers. In 1930s America, laws were set by the government which discriminated against coloured people, and there were laws which would now be considered racist and against the US Constitution. Crooks is not allowed in the bunk house because of this racism. \u201c[I\u2019m not wanted] Cause I\u2019m black. They play cards in there, but I can\u2019t play because I\u2019m black."
"The approach adopted by international agencies and governments of affected countries was to strongly discourage the construction of orphanages and direct their efforts at re-enforcing the traditional family system and improving the capacity of local communities to provide care. The traditional welfare provision for orphans outside families and the kinship system has been containment in institutions, largely financed through charitable donations (Ennew, 2005). The level and quality of care provided in institutions differs from one institution to another depending on the type of internal organization, the size of the family or other internal unit, internal equipment, the number of qualified staff, the working hours of caregivers and the type of relationship they have with the children, management style, the overall atmosphere within the institution and financial resources (Cahajic et al, 2003)."
"She believed that everyone including the rich should help the common man. This is a much more socialist view than S B Fuller\u2019s who would not give any support to the common man as he believed people were right to be in whatever position they were as it shows how hard they worked. In conclusion I believe the two different people disagree as they are from different political views. Also I believe they disagree as one is a self-made businessman who wants to retain his money and not offer support as he is stubborn and Frances Perkins believes in the New Deal and want to better everyone\u2019s chance in life, not just the common man."
"It is the cultural trends which dominate and are allowed to dominate by the people of the society that eventually engineer the evolution of the society, and after having gone through Tendulkar\u2019s perspective, one cannot help but realize the significance of marriage in this very process, and the role that the caste system plays in it. I believe that regarding the case we see in Tendulkar\u2019s Kanyadaan, perhaps it was the caste-based marriage system that keeps us safe from falling into situations such as the one in which the politicians daughter found herself."
"The cause of their connection is based on the actions of a third party, in this case the Society of Music Lovers. The fact that the donor was kidnapped presents a distinguishing factor, allowing the analogy to be applied in cases such as pregnancy because of rape, where it is clear that the mother did not consent in any way to becoming pregnant. There are also dissimilarities. The kidnapping itself has not traumatized the donor, while in the case of a young girl being raped and becoming pregnant, the rape itself is very traumatic."
"When Argentina gained independence in 1816, social conflicts arising from racial and cultural differences were aplenty. La Boca\u2019s neighborhood exhibited this kind of struggle. Conflict in the community existed between the middle-class Italians and the underclass mestizo tenants of houses owned by the immigrants2. The Europeans were protective of their cultural identity and viewed the influx of a large underclass a threat to their heritage. When football became a popular culture in the country in the early twentieth century, the community gave rise to one of its own, the Club Atletico Boca Juniors3."
"The author uses Darwin\u2019s theory to present a theme to the reader that only the strongest can survive in the world and the weak must die, which is why Lennie must die. This is because Lennie is like the sick pup because it would be \u201ccruel to keep him alive\u201d like Carlson said. Overall Slim is presented in \u201cOf mice and men\u201d as the father figure of the ranch and so the leader to whom everyone respects and can talk to in times of need. As he is the father figure of the ranch he is very noble and sees himself as one of the common workers, this is why he is the moral arbiter during the play who voices the opinion of Steinbeck. As George never really had anyone talk to, Slim becomes the confidant for George helping him through George\u2019s grief when he kills Lennie. Slim provides a pivotal role in the Novel because he is the character who is unprejudiced and is one of the common men who is high in the hierarchy."
"These people had cultural practices that differed greatly with those of the Americans and the increased immigration led to overcrowding in the towns. This led to introduction of immigration restrictions. For example in 1907 Japan and U. S. signed an agreement that would see Japan limit immigration into the U. S (Howard and Pintozzi 106). Industrialization also affected farmers. Industrialization led to abandonment of farming by the farmers where they moved to cities in pursuit of higher wages (Howard and Pintozzi 104)."
"The next key category in social determinants is social support. Social support can be given in various forms such as giving material or psychological resources to someone (Cherry, 2018). Upon reading this story, I could not deny the fact how lucky Henrietta was to have the strongest social support in her life which was her family. Her cousins, especially Sadie and Margaret, were the ones who helped her to get through the radiation treatment by giving her the emotional support that she needed. It is mentioned in Chapter 5 of the book where \u201cSadie and Margaret spent their evenings in Henrietta\u2019s living room\u201d having fun together. Towards the end of Henrietta\u2019s life, it was mentioned that Emmet Lacks, his brother and a few of his friends even donated their blood to Henrietta to repay her kindness to them (Skloot, 2010). I admire how she was able to be so positive even though she was sick. I know that people who are sick can be very vulnerable emotionally as they can get stressed or depressed easily, but this did not happen to her."
"According to statistics, police brutality could happen anywhere. The state that has had more shooting up to this date is California, a total of 98 shootings. Overall, there has been a total of 857 people shot and killed by police in 2018. On average, a police officer takes the life of a citizen every seven hours in the United States. Like I said before, the code of honor that police have has not helped one bit. The most shocking statistic that I found was 52% of police officers report that it is not unusual for law enforcement officials to turn a blind eye to the improper conduct of other officers."
"The climate in relation to the various geographical characteristics of Canada associates to the different lifestyle in these regions, eventually altering their identities. This causes distinction in economies of the areas, in turn impacting the political agenda of each region. The concept of regionalism has caused lots of to attack other regions based on the claim that Central Canada manipulates the rest of Canada financially and politically. This stimulates an idea of regional identity rather than a Canadian Identity."
"As a result, an ongoing nationwide debate over the best method of preventing gun violence has arisen from the blood of innocent victims whose lives have been taken by firearms. Out of the plethora of methods suggested to control the amount of casualties caused by guns, 2 of the most prominent include tighter gun control policies and treating mental illness. Contemporary society requires that as a population citizens understand the cause of gun violence across the nation and in effect adopt a social or legislative policy whether that is in the form of gun control or recognizing early signs of violence and being proactive about mental health issues."
"\u2019 Young love is about being flirty, not taking things seriously. \u2018Mother thinks Peter is in love with me, quite frankly, I only wish he were, then we\u2019d be quits and really able to get to know each other.\u2019 As Anne learned of true feelings, she wants to get serious with Peter."
"Caring for each other is genuine and will help better the individuals involved with the initial just the concerns. Having these concerns then wanting to act on them and care for the individual is the start of a friendship. Having this sympathy will make one a better friend and gain the appropriate emotions to which will result in a good friendship. The individuals will gain trust, respect, social support, capitalization, and so much more. A rich friendships also needs intimacy which is a deep connection in which individuals share to enhance their relationship. People share some of the deepest conversations with their friends, things they don\u2019t want to share with anyone else. This is a mutual feeling between friends which makes there bonds grow stronger. This is where it can be confusing because you might be thinking, \u201cthis sounds a lot like love\u201d, and it is our deepest, richest friendships share some of the same characteristics as love. There is a fine line between love and friendship and it seems to be that it is only the physical attraction and physical intimacy that differs."
"Doodling can spark your memory and transport you back in time when you were creating the art (Courneya, 2012). I could recall my early teens and when I used to create art and how it made me feel. I could remember my emotions and how happy I used to be when I made art that expressed my individualism. I was striving to obtain the happiness I once had in my teens. I wanted to reach that level of elation again! My art exposed the duality of human nature. I was ecstatic when I hit that Aha! Moment with my art and felt that euphoria again, I was essentially traveling through time. When art is speaking through its creator or onlookers I mean what an artist is trying to convey may not be what the onlooker is seeing their perception is based on their world."
"Throughout his apology, he uses many rhetorical elements. Some such as pathos, problem and solution, his tone while giving his speech, and an abundant amount of others. Woods uses pathos to appeal to people\u2019s emotions to change what they think of him, his private life, and his indiscretions. He also uses pathos to portray sensitivity toward the attention to his intimate affairs and domestic violence issues in his life that were supposed to be behind-closed-doors. Woods use of pathos could have been used for more than one purpose. The first, is obvious, to give himself a \u201cone-up\u201d to his sponsors, and make his sponsors think that he is a thoughtful and respectable person for publicly announcing his affairs along with apologizing for his actions and misbehavior. He most likely wants his sponsors to see him as a glowing, significant public figure to endorse and advertise their product with. Another use of pathos throughout his address is to appeal to the minds of the audience. Woods wanted to make them feel bad for the violation of his private life and the sudden interest in his relationships. He wanted to create a sense of self loathing for not only himself, but the medias suspicion in his life and career. Conjointly, he also employs problem and solution."
"One other important reason for students in China and India to be more active on studying is because they students would receive severe punishment right away once they fail to achieve certain academic goals, and they punishment could be either physical one or spend a lot of time to write more assignments as a punishment. Students in USA would never worried about he physical punishment because the law protects students from been physically punished, therefore a lot of students would not even care about the academic performances, because they know nothing can ever happen for the foreseeable future."
"And now, I am going to discuss the useful of Google search engine first. The most basic search results and the three main features that I am pointing it out about Google search engine was Anytime, Nearby, and Reading Level. For the basic, when I typed \u201cMechanical Engineering\u201d into the search box, then I got a long list of results instantly, which was about 143,000,000 results."
"More so there is strong relation between parental source of income and student\u2019s scholarly achievements which is a major determinant of student attainments. The type of family that a child comes from either monogamous or polygamous family usually has impact on the child\u2019s academic performance. Parents have less attention as the number of siblings increases."
"In the Elizabethan era it was commonplace to have a Nurse bring up the child, as a mother would today. The character of the nurse would have been a recognizable type to Shakespeare\u2019s audience. A woman who had lost her own baby was an ideal source of milk for an upper-class infant whose mother preferred not to be troubled with doing her own nursing. Babies were weaned by having a foul-tasting salve smeared on the nipple \u201claid wormwood to my dug\u201d. The bodily intimacy between Juliet and the nurse creates a close motherly bond between them."
"What will happen to this huge source of free labor is not longer available this mean this is a conflict, if women are no longer able to do this someone has to and it will cost plenty to govement are to provide incentives to families to try to get them to continue to care for our elderly. 2) How the experiences of the older adults in the video affected personal view of aging? There are program that take care them and day care and that every good for them too. And that marriage hard work, but is worth it. 3) Any other comments you have regarding the video? Yes I like video remember me of mi having fun with granddaughter. Aida I. Rivera GRT 110 Introductions to the Study of Aging Dr."
"The wife then steps onto a stone. This symbolises her decision to try to get though all problems they may come across throughout their marriage. Then the couple takes seven steps around the sacred fire (saptapadi); this is essential according to the Law Code of Manu. Each step represents a different thing: food, power, prosperity, wisdom, children, health and friendship. While taking these steps the husband says to the wife \u2018With utmost love to each other may we walk together\u2026May we make our minds united, of the same vows and of the same thoughts. I am the wind and you are the melody. I am the melody and you are the words\u2019 and on the last step the couple say in unison \u2018Into my will I take thy heart. Thy heart shall follow mine. And the heart of mine be yours\u2019."
"Home health care is a rapidly growing business with today's skyrocketing costs of assisted living facilities and live-in nurses. Find out the legal requirements to run a home health-care agency in your area. Always be up to date on the laws for administering any kind of medication. Advertise your services at local community centers, rehabilitation centers, doctors' offices and hospitals."
"Hell of a nice place. Old Susy\u2019s a laugh\u2013 always crackin\u2019 jokes\u2026 she never talks dirty, neither. Got five girls there\u201d. In the book the men had seen women as exchangeable objects in exchange for money. During the Great Depression men had hard intensive labor jobs while they gave women the easier jobs that were consisting of housework and raising the children. In the book Steinbeck portrays this by Curley\u2019s wife. For example, Curley\u2019s wife wears a \u201ccotton house dress\u201d and she wears her hair in \u201clittle rolled clusters, like sausages\u201d."
"As we see further in the novel, it helps Dana to understand how slaves were treated during this period, allowing her to experience indirect kinship with the Weylins\u2019 slaves in later parts of the novel and embrace her African American lineage. To sum it up, Butler uses a lot of contrasts to set the foundation for Dana and Rufus\u2019 kinship by explaining that even though they are different in racial and cultural aspects, their blood relationship will always serve as a connection between the two, as Rufus exists to ensure Dana\u2019s existence and Dana exists to ensure both their existences. However, relationships this unique are bound to deteriorate at some point, something we see happen later in the novel."
"If a body camera were put to good use, then there would be some clear evidence and complete and fair justice. The evidence would be able to show who was truly at fault. There are many types of disadvantages that involve police officers wearing body cameras but I don\u2019t agree with the. Body cameras might invade privacy of civilians but I still believe they are needed. For example, if there was a police officer that entered someone\u2019s home with a camera, that would be a major invasion of privacy. The video footage from the body camera could be leaked out to the public. Some people might think that the video footage would be the government surveying their citizens."
"The Reason why Rufus is so bad is because he has a mother in prison and his father he never knew. Rufus also was raised terribly by his crazy grandfather who is an advocate for his religion and is very abusive. Sheppard is very selfish because he spends more time with Rufus than the others in the reformatory. He does this because he has a high IQ and believes he has a brighter future than his own. Sheppard thought that by giving Rufus shelter, food, clothing and new shoes it would make him a better person and may change his perspective on life. Rufus has always been against Sheppard because he is an Atheist. Rufus believes that he can be as bad as he wants and be forgiven for his sinful acts in the end just before he dies."
"Students needs to be in an environment were they can learn and have positive energy. Bringing a gun into the class will enforce things we are trying to avoid in the classroom. This could also lead into the teacher coming back the next day and her weapon could have been taken by a student. This makes up more criminals inside the school. When you put lots of weapons in a school, this can become a security problem that puts people in harm of danger. One of the main issues, is the safety on both the teacher and students. Many people don\u2019t like guns and have fear of shooting one."
"After months of paperwork, approvals and visas Mason and his wife Lady Mason arrived in Miami after years of poverty in Cuba. Mason had always dreamed about moving to America and becoming rich, to truly give his wife the life she deserved. Mason believed that already arriving in America had made him rich because he would no longer have to beg just to get food on the table. Mason started off as a cleaner at a nearby motel but after three months he found himself living like he did in Cuba."
"Audre Lorde helps us visualize the violently unique and layered oppression that Black women face, and why it is so important to center their experiences when discussing issues of race and gender instead of sweeping their perspectives under the rug, like any trace of Aura Rosser\u2019s life was. \u201cBut Black women and our children know the fabric of our lives is stitched with violence and with hatred, that there is no rest. We do not deal with it only on the picket lines, or in dark midnight alleys, or in the places where we dare to verbalize our resistance. For us, increasingly, violence weaves through the daily tissues of our living\u201d5 Aura Rosser battled racism and sexism in her life on a daily basis, on an hourly basis."
"And one of the important is that a lot of students might not have a clue about the path of the academic they are going through because they do not get enough assistances while they are not so sure about the system and their future. Some of the students would start to think about their careers and start to think a way to collect capital to start a business, and it make them start to work more in order to save more money in a short period of time."
"Thomson vehemently denies that you are obligated to sacrifice your own life in order to save the violinist, saying that in this case \u201cif anything in the world is true, it is that you do not commit murder, you do not do what is impermissible, if you reach around to your back and unplug yourself from that violinist to save your life. \u201d (Vaughn, 175) Many of Thomson\u2019s other analogies deal with the concept of a woman\u2019s property rights to her body making a case for abortion being permissible. She gives the analogy of a young boy being given a box of chocolates, and eating them before his envious brother."
"Compared to the average American, aliens are more willing to earn lower wages for the same amount of work, increasing their chances of becoming employed. This takes job opportunities from a documented citizen in the U.S. Similarly, these immigrants get away from paying taxes as their information is not recorded. But they still receive the same benefits as American citizens that cost taxpayers, thus using taxpayers money while not making any contributions. One last reason as to the negative effects of undocumented persons is the concern of public safety."
"The equal opportunities law was introduced into society due to the discrimination ethnic minorities had received in history. The policies were implemented to counter racial discrimination and bias. Thus, the equal opportunities law was not created to treat different races differently, its purpose was to treat all people as equals. Affirmative action, however, does not adhere to this principal as by dismissing perfectly capable white candidates for a role in order to employ a less qualified black person, we are not treating everyone as equals. (Hacker 1990)."
"This Euro-influenced religion with its patriarchal God may thus be found guilty of a discursive rape of the values of black people, and to a greater extent \u2013 black women. This is another critical aspect in these examples of Afro-American literature, as rape is no stranger to the black women in these texts \u2013 guilty of undermining their sense of self as well leading to a loss of identity, whether the rape is discursive, or actual. Bell Hooks holds that rape is portrayed as a positive force in The Color Purple because Celie \u2018accedes to the violation of her body in order to protect her sister Nettie from the sexual advances of their stepfather\u2019."
"The relationship between the father and the son in Fences is more of a cyclical phenomenon where ultimately, one will still have an impact on the other. Troy tries to escape from his father, but the effects the father had in his life could not be scrubbed off since Troy takes over his father\u2019s actions and similarly treats his family. His create a complicated relationship with his sons; Lyons and Cory who ultimately push him away from their lives. However, their sons end up being like him by not reaching the dreams they envisioned. Cory ended up as a marine Corp rather than reaching his dream of being a baseball player while Lyons ended up in prison just like his father instead of reaching his dream of being a musician."
"First of all, I thank my father for showing me what a hardworking man truly is. He always had a job, sometimes two, but they never took any quality time away from spending with me. My father always made me remember that any man can help make a baby, but a real man helps raise the baby."
"Undoubtedly, divorces cause a lot of negative effects, some of which are short-term and less harmful, but some can be very lasting and very harmful causing serious health problems, development and behavioral problems in children, leading to a lack of academic or other success, as well as inability to feel happy and pleased with this life."
"The principal was totally shocked and called the teacher to his room. However, the teacher denied all the truth. He said I was a bad girl and I was lying. Therefore, the principle asked the students in the class was that truth or not. All the students said \u201cthe teacher is lying\u201d at the same time. The principle was so angry and fired him. The principle also reported the case to the police, but I don\u2019t know was the teacher in the jail or not. That\u2019s the only time I heroically performed."
"A women has plenty of reasons to have an abortion. The pregnancy can cause many complications to her health or the fetus the women has no way to survive for birth which includes in having an infection or disease. US Department of Health and Human Services (n.d.) On the other hand, some women are not ready for a child mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually which includes women who has been sexually assaulted, a victim of incest, or teen pregnancy. Caring for a baby after one of these traumatic incident be damaging to a woman mentally and physically state of being."
"The Veterans Affairs and Easter Seals teamed up to provide program training for qualified people. The schooling software offers distinctive ways in which the caregivers can receive their training. they may be able to select from on-line education, school room training, or a correspondence path, (\u201cVeterans caregiver schooling,\u201d 2014). for you to be able to start receiving the stipend, they need to whole this schooling. this system consists of six exceptional modules to consist of: caregiver self-care, domestic safety, caregiver skills, veteran personal care, managing tough behaviors, and sources. As outlined above within the short assessment, there are numerous benefits to this system for the caregiver and veteran. There also are annual caregiver education meetings presented just like the one offered in Washington known as\u201d being concerned for individuals who care for Our veterans,\u201d (Stringfellow, 2011)."
"In some Western countries, foreign students studying in those countries have formed an important part of talent when they stayed back to either become citizens or to work there. Malaysia similarly should take advantage of the large number of foreign students coming to Malaysia to study by providing them with an opportunity to make this country their home. What we should be looking for are skills and commitment for the long term \u2013 irrespective of the country of origin."
"For this paper I will apply the six step process on how to teach responsibility and encourage confidence. I will present a mixture of ideas using this approach. Sometimes when faced with a problem it can be overwhelming to consider all the choices and consequences. It is helpful to have a technique to use in making decisions. The six-step problem solving method is helpful in making decisions and coming up with solutions. These six steps are defining the problem, analyze the problem, generate options, evaluate options, make your decisions, and implement and reflect."
"Clearly, there\u2019s a colossal gap between the scientific rejection of race as a thought, and also the widespread acceptance of it as a very important organizing principle of individual identity and collective consciousness. However just declarative that race is socially created doesn\u2019t get at however specific racial ideas get existence, what the elemental determinants of racialization square measure, and the way race articulates with different major axes of stratification and \u201cdifference,\u201d like gender and sophistication. the maximum amount as we might all wish to believe that race and color discrimination has been for the most part stock-still enter the us, we have a tendency to all recognize higher. As issues with favoritism still exist in society at massive, they\u2019re sure to creep into the geographical point yet. Employers United Nations agency square measure involved and proactive with their company culture could train workers on discrimination within the geographical point and promote diversity, however favoritism will still append through the cracks."
"While a fetus is a potential human life, it does not need to be afforded the same rights as the woman who it resides in. The pro-choice community believes in a woman\u2019s right to decide whether having the baby fits in with her life circumstances and health, being that she didn\u2019t ask to be raped and impregnated. Modern abortion procedures are believed to be safer than childbirth and result in less than one death in 100,000. Whereas, childbirth\u00a0is responsible for 13 deaths in 100,000."
"\u2018Triumph\u2019 emphasises her thought of marriage as a competition, by using a word associated by a victory. The exclamation mark also shows her excitement towards the situation. This competitive attitude shows throughout both sisters\u2019 letters. This use of the word triumph is repeated again later in the letter. This repetition emphasises the competition and how much she values it."
"After two weeks; my partner and I moved to clean the dormitories. This activity included; washing the floors, cleaning the windows and making their beds too. The girls\u2019 dormitory was bigger than the boys\u2019 dormitory because the population of girls is higher in the home. The kitchen duty was led by Mama Marlon and Madam Selina; we helped them to clean the kitchen, make tea and porridge for the children, sorting the rice and beans that would be served for lunch, fetch the water to be used in the kitchen."
"In a minute or two the bear came very close to them. One of the friends at once jumped up a tree. He forgot his promise to help his friend and left him at the mercy of the beast. The other friends had no time to climb up a tree."
"Home again, I see him drinking weak tea, Eating a stale chapati, reading a book. He goes into the toilet to contemplate Man\u2019s estrangement from a man-made world. Coming out he trembles at the sink, The cold water running over his brown hands, A few droplets cling to the greying hairs on his wrists. His sullen children have often refused to share Jokes and secrets with him."
"So Modern Family is an American family series which is created by Mr. Christopher Lloyd and Mr. Steven Levitan. It is an situational comedy presented as a form of mockumentary. Mockumentary is a type of TV show which takes a topic and shows it humorously in documentary form. So, this show entertains through its humour and teaches us life lesson at the same time. Show is all about the drift and drags of life of Jay Pritchett and his family. Jay Pritchett is retired closet business owner. Family includes Jay\u2019s 2nd wife, their teenage son, his daughter and son in law and his homosexual adult son."
"Perspectives like the functionalist and new right as described to be \u2018modernist\u2019 because they see modern society. The nuclear family has shaped and changed to fit society which helps maintain it by performing some essential functions. According to Chester (1985), there was little evidence that people were choosing to live on a long-term basis in alternatives to the nuclear family. However, he did accept that some changes were taking place in family life. In particular, many families were no longer \u2018conventional\u2019 in the sense that the husband was the sole breadwinner. He accepted more women are out working to finical support their family. He called this new family form, in which wives have got jobs, the neo-conventional family. Although many people are not part of the nuclear family at one time in the life is largely due to the life-cycle. Many people who are currently living alone i.e. widows, singleton or those who are yet to get married, were either part of a nuclear family in the past or will be in the future. Chester argues that the statistics is misleading and does not portray that most people will spend a major part of their life in a nuclear family."
"Due to this idea, the individual closes his or her mind to have any dialogue or contact with any of the members of that culture. However, through multiculturalism close contact between the two cultures are possible where in the other culture could be praised for their perspective of maintaining the environment that has been the top priority of many environmentalists while the other culture could be reinforced to understand that the continuous exploitation of the environment for the improvement of their prized technology does not reach the standards of true progressiveness."
"Another tragedy which could\u2019ve been avoided if John didn\u2019t subjugate his wife into isolation. Both Tragedies occur due to Subjugation, isolation and disrespect. Both Gilman and Glaspell illustrate the consequences of subjugation through isolation and disrespect. Similarly, neither women had anyone to talk to besides for themselves in their minds due to isolation. They were both treated with disrespect which caused insanity because they couldn\u2019t do anything about it due to subjugation. In conclusion only negativity is derived from subjugation, isolation and disrespect."
"The prepared environment in Montessori Classroom includes availability of child-size real materials for the children to practice whenever they want and also appropriate for their age group. It also includes colorful materials so as to make it attractive for the child and inculcates interest in them for repeated practice thus gaining full control over the materials and gaining more knowledge about the activities. )"
"Even the \u201cdeserving poor\u201d who received public assistance were often forced to wear badges or some marking signifying that they were receiving public assistance\u201d (The History of Homelessness, para. 3). The 19th and 20th century\u2019s homeless population still consisted of men, and ,it was not until the Great Depression hit in the 1930s, that a new era of homelessness, including woman, children, adolescents, entire families, the elderly, substance abusers, war veterans, and the chronically and mentally ill."
"Biased policing, racial violence and the racially biased war on drugs all contribute to the fact that African Americans are 5.1 times more likely to be incarcerated compared to the incarceration of Caucasians. In the United states, black people make up about 13.2% of the population. However, they constitute 40% of the population in prisons. Caucasians have the lowest poverty rate in America, making up about 9%, while African Americans have the highest rate of poverty, making up 24.1%. This is a huge factor when it comes to the manifestation of anti-black violence. From 2009 to 2013, almost half of whites who were in poverty, were able to move above it, while only one third of the blacks were able to do the same (Douglas, 2017). All of these factors contribute to \u201cschool to prison pipeline\u201d. This has a huge impact on the lives on young black men as it means that it is easier for black youth to get involved with drugs and crimes than it is to get a quality education. The United States Department of Education, had recently showed data that proves that black males are three times more likely to be suspended from school compared to whites. Black females, are six times more likely to be suspended than white females. In the juvenile system, black females are the fastest growing population. The chances of black children living in poverty become much higher when they are being trapped in the juvenile justice system (Douglas, 2017)."
"There was me who is the oldest, my brother Andrew who is three years younger, and brother Anthony who is five years younger. Me and my brothers grew up being very close. I was like a second mother to them helping them learn things such as assist in changing them, making them breakfast in the morning when they were younger. When they got older, they would come to me for advice, and sometimes I just gave it to them even if they didn\u2019t want to hear."
"Elementary and middle schools ban innocent children from even creating a figure of a gun with their mere fingers, yet mentally unstable adults are allowed to carry guns around as they please. In a nation where even Wal-Mart is selling guns, it is no wonder why these dangerous machines of destruction often fall into the wrong hands. It is evidently clear that the few pros of lean gun control do not substantiate its public danger. Consider today\u2019s generation. The majority also plays video games such as Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty."
"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in pediatric population, more commonly in children below 15years old. It originates from skeletal muscles and can affect any part of the body. During childhood, a genital location for this tumor is second most common, following the head and neck. Risk factor includes familial history of rhabdomyosarcoma. This clinically presents as a tumor mass, associated with vaginal bleeding. Its advance stage, often presents with urinary symptoms. The typical histologic findings of diffuse proliferation of rhabdoid cells that are round or polygonal in shape with eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and glassy eosinophilic cytoplasm containing hyaline-like inclusion bodies is diagnostic of rhabdomyosarcoma. Immunohistochemical expression of desmin confirms the diagnosis. Multimodality therapy is the optimal therapeutic approach. Conservative therapy with chemotherapy or radiotherapy after the initial excision has been reported with excellent results. Chemotherapy is mandatory, agents used include vincristine and actinomycin with either cyclophosphamide (VAC) or ifosfamide (IVA). Prognosis if diagnosed in early stage, is very good, with an average 5-year survival of 85-90%. 1"
"For families with children, the employment of parents is vital to address the wellbeing of family members. Increasingly, when we consider parental employment, it is not only fathers\u2019 employment that is of concern, but also mothers\u2019. How parents work out work applies both to those families with two parents in the workforce and those with a single parent working."
"Even after the Civil Rights act African Americans were still not treated equally. On the night of May\u2019s death, a policeman visits August\u2019s home. He tells Lily that she should live with her aunt or another family member. He didn\u2019t think it was right for a white person to live with blacks. Even though he can see how Boatwright\u2019s love and care for Lily his prejudice tries to pull Lily away from them. When Rosaleen goes to jail she is treated unfairly. The white men demand her to apologize and she refuses. When she refuses they hit her on the head with a flashlight and then Rosaleen and Lily are put in a jail cell. Because Rosaleen is black her side of the story didn\u2019t matter. This scene shows how during this time people \u201cwere being judged for their sentiments as well as the color of their skin\u201d (Smith 2)."
"No matter how much Martine tries, she fails to make Sophie fit into the role of the Marassas twin. Martine describes, \u201cThey looked the same, talked the same, walked the same,\u201d (84) indicating how she envisions the way she and her daughter should be. Sophie, however, never viewed herself as Martine\u2019s twin prior to this description of the Marassas. When she sees a picture of Atie, her mother, and herself in Martine\u2019s house she says, \u201cI looked like no one in my family. Not my mother. Not my Tante Atie. I did not look like them when I was a baby and I did not look like them now\u201d (45). Not only was she not raised by her own mother, but she didn\u2019t even look like Martine. The narrative voice conveys that Sophie is observant yet unruffled; there is no sense of emotional reaction only an objective remark, indicating that it doesn\u2019t make a difference to Sophie. When Marc takes Martine and Sophie out to dinner, Sophie once again thinks about the fact that she does not look like her mother solely by the waiter\u2019s expression. She says, \u201cHe looked at us for a long time. First me, then my mother. I wanted to tell him to stop it. There was no resemblance between us. I knew it\u201d (55). Sophie\u2019s tone of voice conveys her irritation; by now, she has accepted the fact that she and her mother look nothing like each other. There is no changing it."
"For everyone that wants a ban on animal testing you should really think twice. Many arguments that have come out about banning this are very short and not much to say and there is a reason for this. Approximately 5 billion animals are consumed as food annually compared to that, only 17-22 million animals are used for in research annually. Anesthesia is used today to numb the body during operations because it was successfully tested on animals 6 % of animals do are experiencing pain (not death). AIDs research also relies heavily on animal testing. If a cure is ever going to be figured out for this disease we will need to experiment on animals. We need to focus on the future of cosmetics and medicine and not be so concerned about the animal being tested harmfully."
"Barbara has had a tremendous impact on the family, because she lives alone. To insure her pass medical history doesn\u2019t repeat she needs a supervisor. Barbara has 3 children. One being my mother and the other 2 being the males in the family. There have been some health challenges because she has to drink more water and incorporate more vegetables and positive protein in her diet. Being that Barbara is 60 years old she doesn\u2019t quite like change in her life but knowing that she needs change she is willing to do it. Such things incorporate smoking, corpulence, the absence of physical action, an excess of salt, an excessive amount of liquor, stress, ceaseless kidney disappointment, thyroid issues, more seasoned age, hereditary qualities, and family ancestry. The precise reason for HBP is obscure. Sometimes it isn\u2019t realized what is making one have hypertension."
"All this time Lennie sat greiving at the riverbank and had visions of his Aunt Clara and giant rabbits cursing him and condoning him. Then George finds him and Lennie is worried about George giving him hell, and how George always said that Lennie weighed down his future. George was surprisingly calm and had to do what he could to save Lennie from the mob. Taking the stolen Luger from Lennie, George tells Lennie one last time about their dream place and how they would live of \u201cthe fat of the land\u201d and Lennie begs to go to that paradise of his with his heard of rabbits to tend. George then aims the gun at Lennie\u2019s head as he (Lennie) is looking out to the other side of the river and pulls the trigger\u2026. As soon as he kills his friend and lifelong brother. the mob arrives and George tells them what he did. Slim realizes what George goes through and tries his best to console him over a drink."
"5. Long Term Orientation (LTO) \u2013 This refers to how much society values long-standing \u2013 as opposed to short term \u2013 traditions and values. This is the fifth dimension that Hofstede added in the 1990s after finding that Asian countries with a strong link to Confucian philosophy acted differently from western cultures. In countries with a high LTO score, delivering on social obligations and avoiding \u201closs of face\u201d are considered very important."
"There is a very big difference between the way the other characters in the books think of Mally from Malachi\u2019s Cove and Curley\u2019s wife from Of Mice and Men. When Curley\u2019s wife is first mentioned, Candy tells George how \u201cshe got the eye.\u201d He later goes on to say, \u201cI think Curley\u2019s married a tart.\u201d These are the first impressions the reader gets of Curley\u2019s wife. When she finally arrives on scene and meets Lennie and George for the first time, \u201cthe rectangle of sunshine in the doorway was cut off.\u201d Steinbeck symbolises her personality again, this time using light and dark. He tries to indicate that Curley\u2019s wife is bad news by using darkness. He also tries to show that there is no hope of a future for Lennie and George whilst she\u2019s standing in the way of their light."
"Although Mostafanezhad said that popular mass and social media outlets have become important sites for public moral education,(Mostafanezhad, 2013), the role of digital marketing on it has not been taken into account yet, only the Images of volunteer tourists with young children are now regular representations of the volunteer tourism experience on social networking sites (Mostafanezhad, 2013)."
"Most coaches do not allow their players to have a real relationship because they are afraid that a female influence will \u201csoften\u201d a player. The athletes are taught not to \u201csee the guy across the line as a human being, how can they see women as human beings? As long as you rear boys to be tough, dominant, in charge, they simply won\u2019t be prepared for contemporary women (Miedzian).\u201d Most researchers agree that one of the main reasons athletes abuse their spouses is because they have grown accustomed to the mistreatment of women which surrounds sports. \u201cSports culture creates a negative attitude towards women, attitudes of superiority that could lead to violence,\u201d says Michael Messner, associate professor of sociology at USC (qtd in L.A. Times). Alisa DelTufo, the founder of Sanctuaries for Families, a shelter for abused women, admits, \u201cDomestic Violence is a very difficult cycle for a woman to break (qtd in Sports Illustrated).\u201d"
"In the novel \u2018Of Mice and Men\u2019 Steinbeck stresses the importance and abnormality of the friendship between George and Lennie by using a variety of methods. They are complete opposites, yet they share a journey through the struggles of The Great Depression as friends and have faith in the same dream. This pulls them together through the most stressful parts of the novel. These two itinerant workers meet many people along their journey, but the bond between them doesn\u2019t weaken."
"In the end, Amy Chua successfully applies many techniques which effective content including writing style and the usage of examples, statistic as well as expressions in Why Chinese Mothers Are Superior. Although this article was criticized by many readers about the affair of children abuse because the different perspectives about interpreting Amy Chua\u2019s tone and examples in the article, we cannot negate that Amy Chua was a good writer who undoubtedly achieved her goal in transferring her idea using many writing skills."
"Marriage is seen as an obligation for women in these societies, especially if they are not from the higher classes. Marriage is based on contracting families and getting favourable financial outcomes and not on individual love. Angela is told \u2018she has no right to disdain that prize of destiny\u2019 denying her her own choice as mentioned earlier. In \u2018Blood Wedding\u2019 it is the father whom is asked if the daughter can marry the Bridegroom first and not the Bride; ultimately here too it is not her choice."
"I recently watched a video which was a social experiment to see how people reacted to domestic violence in public, what I gathered from it was shocking. In the two minute video it showed a woman being man-handled by the male in the relationship and as this goes on people in the public approach the couple and come between them, expressing deep concern for the woman\u2019s wellbeing."
"The children were arguing in the back and, I, who played the father, was reading the paper in the front, leaving the mother to drive and control the children. Soon after, there are screams as the car crashes, we represented this by all slowly moving forward, we froze with our heads on our knees for a few seconds then gradually sat up again, looking weary and in pain. Fiona, who played the mother, remained with her head on her knees to show that she was dead and not going to sit back up again. We then moved back to the family photograph, this time without the mother."
"g \u201chow would you fell if somebody said that to you? \u201d allowing the child(A) to think of it from the other child(B) perspective. I would be careful not to make the child(A) feel disliked by me, \u201c I like child(A), I dont like it when somebody is un kind. \u201d Should situations like this arise again I would gain support from the class teacher. Possibly even touching on the subject of everybody being different within lesson plans. This allowing children to learn about diffent people, backgrounds, genders, appearance etc. Also teaching them how to be kind and helpful to one another."
"In fact, according to the Uniform Probate Code of the United States section 2-103 in the event that one dies without a will, both children and the whole of their estate go to their family (source). Many find it intriguing that it is the conventional assumption within our society that in a time of crisis, it is the presence of those we are most concerned about in our lives our family- that is of most importance."
"There is a concept in the U.S. Constitution called equal protection under law. What this means, is that no one in the U.S is better or worse than anyone else in the U.S when it comes to the law. This applies to everyone equally whether it be a cop, Donald Trump or even a homeless person. It has become an epidemic in the USA that cops regularly kill innocent people and nothing is done. This is an issue that has been brought into the focus of the public eye."
"For instance, when you are playing on a basketball team, you must be truthful to each other and tell other teammates when someone is messing up. This will make you an honest person by calling out someone\u2019s flaws no matter whether or not it will help them or hurt their feelings. In addition, you also must be able to tell your teammates when they are doing good so that you can encourage them."
"This maybe the reason why her dream was locked away and only brought out when she needed it to emotionally look back at it; considering that she lived in a men\u2019s society it means that women are held back from what they wanted to do and were expected become a housewife. This is the main road block that Curley\u2019s wife comes across making her dream futile. Throughout the novel the reader realises that the characters that we\u2019re too eager for their dream (Lennie and Curley\u2019s wife) reaches their destiny, quite dramatically, with their death."
"This pattern continues when Ismene fearfully replies, \u201cI must yield to those in authority\u201d, only to have Antigone quickly snap, \u201cI will bury [Polyneices]; and if I must die, I say that this crime is holy: I shall lie down with him in death, and I shall be as dear to him as he to me\u2026you may do as you like, since apparently the laws of the gods mean nothing to you\u201d (Prologue, 51-65). Notably, Antigone appeals to the notion of guilt in order to make her argument more compelling when claiming that \u201cthe laws of the gods mean nothing\u201d to Ismene. This demonstrates the clash between the two, as Antigone\u2019s dedication to her family reaches far beyond the constructs of the state while Ismene\u2019s halts when \u201cthose in authority\u201d stand in the way. In this way, Ismene\u2019s commitment to the state tests Antigone\u2019s loyalty to her brother, but is ultimately not enough to stop her from defying Creon\u2019s edict in what she considers a \u201ccrime [that] is holy\u201d. Clearly, family plays the role of a pillar of loyalty that fuels Antigone to defy the state in the sake of her late brother; in the end, even her sister\u2019s fear of dissent cannot stop it. Next, when considering the relationship between Creon and Haimon, familial loyalty motivates Creon to maintain power over the state."
"Before this time, the only empire that came close to being dominant and of Eurasian origin are the Hellenistic empires. Yet these empires are not one and the same as Europe, and never gained as large a dominance as the Muslims had after them (467). In contrast to the Eurocentric model of civilization is the strong Turkish (Muslim) civilization\u2014historically represented by the term \u201cAsia\u201d (Blaut, 20). This area, which later became known as the Ottoman Empire, was dominant within its region."
"\u201cThe realities of climate change mean that every sector must get to grips with its impact on the environment. Aviation in particular has been in the spotlight in recent months. This is why leadership on climate change issues, and the sustainability agenda more broadly, is absolutely essential to underpin an airline\u2019s continued capacity for success. Virgin Atlantic understands this and is committed to developing a more sustainable business and finding practical solutions to reduce the industry\u2019s impact on the environment. By working together we can help the airline understand what sustainability could look like for Virgin Atlantic and what operation within environmental limits looks like.\u201d Jonathon Porritt, co-founder of Forum for the Future (2006)"
"There is a study that bases its research on the five\u2010factor model personality traits of both the children and the parents which induced conformity in 3.5-year-old children by employing a model similar to Asch\u2019s in overt conformity (public reactions) is measured along with also internal judgements (internal beliefs after conformist reactions): A correct covert judgement after an incorrect conformist reaction due to a socially normative incentive. However, a false internal judgement caused by an informational incentive. The data showed that high parental introversion was related to the participants\u2019 overall level of conformity and that high participant introversion and high openness were correlated with an informational instead of a normative incentive to conform. This suggests that consideration of the context of the social setting or the level of social engagement could be a significant variable in the appearance of conformity. (Hellmer, Stenberg, & Fawcett, 2018)"
"Bullying behavior has been continuously changing over the years. Different forms of bullying have emerged and they continue to develop and be used in the schools. Technology has played a very big role in the evolution of behavior. The first forms of bullying that have existed over the years included both direct and indirect methods that were used in the practice. The methods continue to be in use until today but have been evolved by the use of technology."
"Intercultural Communication is the verbal and nonverbal communication between individuals from various social foundations. Communication is an important part of daily life. There are many cultures around the world. As we research them, we can get more knowledge about different cultures. I learned many things during this course (intercultural communication). It helps us to gain information about what is really meant to belong to a different culture."
"Seven death convicts were executed during the Estrada administration before he announced a moratorium on executions. 1999 Leo Echegaray, 38, was executed by lethal injection on February 5, 1999. He was the first to be executed after the Philippines restored death penalty. It was the Philippine\u2019s first execution in 22 years. Six more men followed within the next 11 months."
"Yet in virtually, every case we are resorting to is prejudice by ascribing characteristics about a person based on appearance, without knowledge of the total facts. By stereotyping, we assume that a person or a group of certain characteristics. Quite often, we have stereotyped a person who might be a member of a group with which we have not had firsthand contact with before. (Why do we stereotype?, 2012). According to psychologist Gordon Allport, prejudice and stereotypes emerge in part as a result of normal human thinking. In order to make sense of the world around us, it is important to sort information into mental categories. \u201cThe human mind must think with the aid of categories,\u201d Allport explained. \u201cOnce formed, categories are the basis for normal prejudgment. We cannot possibly avoid this process. Orderly living depends upon it.\u201d This process of categorization applies to the social world as well, as we sort people into mental groups based on factors such as age, sex and race.

"In fact, after I graduated from university, I went to Malacca for a few days all by myself to enjoy the isolation. Ha ha, until now, my parents weren\u2019t aware this was what I did \u2013 and I can\u2019t yet find the courage to inform them. (This is probably a secret I will bring to my grave). Okay, this was probably not so much of an adventure, but I did derive certain excitement out of this trip. Imagine me on a free and easy trip carrying just the map and walking around (and people who know me know I\u2019ve a very, very poor sense of direction). I would not say I managed to find my sense of purpose in life during that very short trip."
"The business was doing well with up to $10 million in sales by the end of the decade. The company fell on hard times after feeling the delayed affects three years after the 2008 recession began. Even though the company had boasted the $15 million in sales in 2011 the company filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2012."
"I believe that I am the best person for this job because of my academic qualification and experience that I have so far managed to achieve through a sense of commitment, dedication, hard work and self-confidence. I have a passion for working closely with patients, irrespective of their background or beliefs."
"Vincent sees this as an opportunity to stand up to xenophobic bogans but by joining the gang Vincent isolates himself from his family. Directors Neil Paddington and Stuart McKenzie use dark, blue lightening in many of the scenes in \u2018Chinese Whispers\u2019 to portray the sad, sinister world Vincent is being lured into. This is an effective visual feature because it stresses the consequences of Vincent\u2019s decisions. An example of this is Vincent\u2019s decision to conform to the Triad ways by taking illegal narcotics. Blue lighting is also used when Vincent\u2019s father is sitting in a room lonely and longing for his distant son."
"In this cartoon the umbrella symbolises the population trying to shield and protect themselves, and the rain represents the depression. In summary the umbrella represents America\u2019s attempt to protect themselves from the depression. FDR is throwing this away as if to say you don\u2019t need to protect yourselves anymore, I will protect you until the depression is over. In this cartoon FDR is a tall, strong, youthful, exuberant, happy, idealistic and confident man. He lifts the bin with ease and looks very confident and happy showing he knows what he is doing and he is going to clean up and restore the country."
"So many races are discriminated against due to stereotypes. Many people, such as Middle Easterns, are judged based on the act of a couple of people from their race (The attack on 9/11 being one example).Immigration is also a huge problem in the racism epidemic currently in the United States. There are countless heros that have contributed greatly to the end of racial discrimination and immigration rights of all people like Rosa Parks, Harriet Tubman, and Eva Longoria."

"The communication between the two, or lack thereof, fell somewhere between both myths. Restall uses his concise writing style to explain the resilience of the Natives, debunking the myth of Native desolation and how the myth of superiority derives from Eurocentric beliefs of racial dominance which lead to racist ideologies that \u201cunderpinned colonial expansion from the late fifteenth to early twentieth centuries.\u201d"
"Just like English and Tagalog, \u201cconyo\u201d talk is just another way of Filipinos, especially the teens, to express and to communicate. Despite being referred to as the way of the \u201crich kids\u201d to talk, \u201cconyo\u201d talk can be heard almost all around the Philippines, especially, in conversations in almost all of the universities in the Metro Manila. Students from private schools and universities are more likely to be heard talking in a \u201cconyo\u201d way. English and Tagalog words are combined to make a sentence or phrase. I"
"It is set on a remote island, where Prospero, the rightful Duke of Milan, plots to restore his daughter Miranda He conjures up a storm, the eponymous tempest, to lure his usurping brother Antonio and the complicit King Alonso of Naples to the island. There, his machinations bring about the marriage of Miranda to Alonso\u2019s son, Ferdinand. The story draws heavily on the tradition of the romance, and it was influenced by tragicomedy and the courtly masque. It differs from Shakespeare\u2019s other plays in its observation of a stricter, more organized neoclassical style."
"Both of these examples show just how serious discrimination can be. How can the world diminish prejudice and discrimination? According to Robert S Feldman, psychologists have developed several strategies that have proved effective. The first is to increase contact between the target of stereotyping and the holder of the stereotype research shows that increasing the amount of interaction between groups can reduce negative stereotyping. The second is to make values and norms against prejudice more conspicuous."
"\u201cThe Merchant of Venice\u201d is a play about friendship & love. In the first scene itself Antonio displays the nature of love & friendship he feels for Bassanio, \u201cMy purse, my person, my extremest means lie all unlocked to your occasions\u201d. There is also a predominance of young people and many pairs of lovers and multiple marriages are present in the play."
"The Channel 5 programme \u2018Rich House, Poor House\u2019 explores Britain\u2019s extreme wealth divide and brings light on the big question of does money really buy happiness. In order to see what life is like on the other side, a family that ranks in the top ten per cent of Britain\u2019s wealthiest households trades homes, lifestyles and budgets with a family from the bottom ten per cent. As the experiment progresses the families follow each other\u2019s typical spending habits and extra-curricular activities to learn if the grass really is greener."
"Published in 1859 by Charles Darwin, On the Origin of the Species stated that humans had slowly evolved from lower forms of life. The theory of evolution cast serious doubt on the idea of religion. Conservatives stood firmly in their beliefs of God and religion, while Modernists flatly refused to accept the Bible in its entirety."
"Pascual lives is a quiet and calm neighborhood where he is part of a diversified community from whites, blacks and Hispanics who all live together in peace and harmony. He has a big house but every basic thing he needs is downstairs since he uses a walker and a wheelchair. He also has an easy access to go in and out of his house through the installment of handicap access ramp. He has home health care nurses and Personal Care Assistants who come in frequently to check on him and help him with activities of daily living like cooking, bathing, dressing, cleaning the house and provide transportation to where ever he wants to go. Communication According to Friedman, Bowden & Jones (2003), communication facilitates the transmitting of our feelings, needs, ideas and things in our minds (p, 267). Mr. Pascual states clearly what he wants and his feeling especially when he is upset or happy. An example was when one of his children was sick, he called her and called his sons and daughters to call his sick daughter to check on her and keep on insisting that he was worried about her. This prompted all his children to call her and check on her about her health. Power Structure Mr. Pascual told me that he is the head of his family and has been providing and protecting his family while his wife was a house wife who took care of her entire household. Base on hierarchy Mr. Pascual was the head followed by his wife and his children. According to Friedman et al. (2003), coalitions are either temporary, issue-based alliances, or long-term alliances made to offset the dominance of one or more other family members (p. 300). In their family they respect their elders so the was no coalitions of any sort in the family. Furthermore, concerning power bases, the parents had more power than their children. Role Structure The formal relationship here are father and husband, mother and wife, daughter and sisters and son and brothers. Mr. Pascual was the provider of the family while his wife was the leader when it comes to managing the household since she knows everything that happens at home. He and his wife Monique also fulfill their marital role of husband and wife. Furthermore, the informal roles which he performed was that of encourager. According to Friedman et al. (2003), an encourager praises, agrees with and accepts the contribution of others. For example, when his wife told him that they needed a new house because the house was too small for them, he accepted and assured her that they were going to look for a new house. Values: Norms & Rules According to Friedman, Bowden & Jones, the family\u2019s cultural heritage is a prime source of family\u2019s value system and norms. Mr. Pascual\u2019s family values originate from his Hispanic heritage one of familism which entails that they value more of their family members and their togetherness as oppose to the American Core Values of individualism. When they have any major events like anniversary the whole family come together to celebrate. Spiritual Activities Mr. Pascual is a devoted Roman Catholic Christian. Everyday he watches the mass and rosary on his television at 9:30am. He also goes to church every Sunday to hear the word of God. Furthermore, his children have followed his path and they also go to church and they try everyone that they come across with love and respect life if you are part of their family. Socialization Mr. Pascual stated that him and his entire household went to church every Sunday and his children interacted with other Christian children. They met on Saturdays to talk about bible verses. He and wife trained his children the in the ways of God. They often went to Mexico on vacation to meet their extended family members. Adaptation Mr. Pascual stated that he suffered a great lost in august 2018 when he lost his wife. He said it was a very difficult moment because they have been together that he always missed her. So, in order to cope with her lost he put his trust in God and listens to music to forget and stop thinking about his wife absence. He always talks about his wife in a positive way by saying that she is in a better place. He always cracks jokes to make everyone around him happy that when he says something, we all think he is joking. Health Care Mr. Pascual stated that when anyone was sick in house, they will first try to use home remedies to treat but if it does not work then they can go to the hospital or the clinic to check what is going on. Furthermore, he said that since he is not that active as before he makes sure that he performs some physical therapy two times a week to maintain his strength and balance to move around. Interventions My recommendation to maintaining Mr. Pascual\u2019s family health will be more proactive by ambulating frequently at least 10 minutes everyday to maintain strength to upper and lower extremities. Also, he must reduce his salt and fluid intake because all of these promotes fluid retention inn the body which can cause respiratory and edema problems. Friedman et al. (2003) stated that the Health Belief Model has been used extensively to assist in determining why people engage in certain activities that will or will not promote their health and well-being (p.432). What Mr. Pascual told was that he has been used to eating a lot of spicy and salty foods but has now come to the realization of the side effects of excess salts because it leads to him retenting fluids. He has now decided to limit his fluid and salt intake to be in good health. Mr. Pascual is an amazing God fearing and family man who wants everyone around him feel accepted and happy. He raised his family to be God fearing and caring. His story is one of a change in his childhood social status to one of a more comfortable life. Reference Friedman, M. M., Bowden, V. R., & Jones, E.

"Substitutes are another type of people you should respect in a classroom environment. You should respect them because they are older than you and have power over you. You should be respectful towards them because they could possibly write a bad report for your class and give it to the teacher. If the teacher gets a bad report about your class then they just might make you do extra work. Remember, substitutes are guests in your classroom and you shouldn\u2019t be rude to guests."
"Introduction: Book is our real and best friend. It gives us knowledge and pleasure. It is the main element of education. Our worldly friend may give us but book never gives us. Kinds: There are different kinds and different sizes of books in the world. They are the books of story, books of drama, books of poem, books of novel, books of fashion and design, books of religion, books of cooking, books of entertainment, books of accounting, books of philosophy, books of science and technology, books of computer and books of Bengali and English literature etc."
"This caused her too often get blisters on her hand and then she would also have to cook sitting down in a squatting position which was uncomfortable for her back, yet she would not complain due to her embarrassment and fear. She also cleaned pots and plates at the pond in that bent over position. At the end of the day her back would hurt extremely bad yet proper treatment were not accessible to her at most she said she would get hot oil massage (sarishar tel) from her sister in law (nanad)."
"Furthermore, according to findings published by the National Union of Teachers (NUT, 2015), accountability measures disproportionally affect disadvantaged pupils and those with SEN or disabilities with teachers reporting that these children are more likely to be removed from lessons to be coached in maths and English at the expense of a broad curriculum.With the focus being firmly placed on the three core subjects are we truly celebrating pupils diversity or indeed are we meeting the needs of all individuals? Standards as Attitudinal Barriers to InclusionGlazzard (2011), examined perceived barriers to inclusion by conducting interviews with a focus group of teachers and concluded that the standards agenda represented the key barrier to pupils\u2019 participation and achievement."
"Emily was jealous of Sarah because she was seen as the social and beautiful one. The mother points out that Emily resented her for her absence in her childhood. The mother attempts to bond with Emily by encouraging her to enter a school amateur show. Emily ends winning the show by telling jokes for the audience. The story ends with the mother admitting that Emily was influenced by depression, fear, and war."
"Frontiers in Marine Science is an open-access academic publisher that posts peer-reviewed articles on its website. This specific article as a source would be incredibly reliable and insightful as the information provided came from a focus group of women at a biology conference. That means they have personally faced discrimination and can testify to the best solutions. The purpose of the article itself is to identify gender-based problems at STEM conferences and propose solutions to those problems. The introduction provides various useful statistics concerning the percentages of women in STEM jobs, research positions, and conferences while also emphasizing the need for equity rather than equality. The authors then list the ten solutions they have come up with based on discussions from diversity focus groups. These include codes of conduct, safety officers, honor pledges, mentorship programs, focus groups, rewards for diversity programming, childcare, travel grants, badges, and a randomized program. While, at the moment, I do not intend to focus on proposing solutions to gender inequality, this article emphasizes how unwelcome and unsafe women feel in their STEM fields. This not only reflects society\u2019s views on the matter though they may not be deliberate, it gives another reason that women may but put off by a career that they do not feel welcome in."
"Sometime recently there were innovative gadgets; children would take part in exercises with their companions. They would go exterior and play for hours until their guardians called for them. Since at that point, present-day culture has harmed childhood. One might contend that innovation benefits children more. In any case, children learn through play and redundancy. On the off chance that you clarify to a child and give them one or two of squares. They may learn so much. They might learn something so simple such as checking, colors, letters, and much more. You have got to be quiet when managing with children since a few might not learn from the primary time. The caregiver must too be beyond any doubt to assist them at whatever point they star. Guardians can set up parental direction which sets restrictions for kids. It controls what they can get to. There are so numerous ways around the parental direction. If a child needs to go more profound into something, they will discover a way to do so. For occasion, they might go on a diverse gadget and pick up get to."
"The fact that animals are used to study pain, depression, anxiety, and to test pain-killing drugs for human use, demonstrates that scientists recognize that animals are capable of suffering in many ways just like humans, but these sentient animals are unable to give their consent to participate in research. The fact that animals can suffer and experience pain is sufficient reason to refrain on moral grounds from harming them."
"3. everybody, especially the media are concern of the rights and privileges of the child which was not given emphasis before; and 4. Parents are comfortable enough that their children are covered by the government through pursuing the laws. As part of the saying \u201c\u2026there is no perfect law\u2026\u201d there are also loopholes in these provisions which unknowingly created bad outcomes and new problems in the implementation, such as: 1. created ill-mannered pupils/less values/misconducts;"
"If management does not supply employees\u2019 consequences for workplace bullying, the company may face consequences of their own. Continued workplace bullying creates stress for the employee being bullied. Rodr\u0131guez-Munoz, Baillienc, De Witte, Moreno-Jimenez, and Pastor researched and found that workplace bullying has many negative effects on the individual being bullied. Stressors eventually affect the employee\u2019s well-being and health. Some employees experience sleep disorders, alcohol abuse, and depression (2009). Due to the employee\u2019s health concerns, they may decide to leave the company. The company will then need to replace a beneficial employee, which incurs costs and time."
"Although the success of The Cosby Show dispelled negative perceptions of the black community the initial idea was thrown, which contributes to racial segregation in American at that time during the 80\u2019s. However, the typical black family perception did change as a result of \u2018The Cosby Show\u2019 and opened the doors for many comedians and sitcoms to come. \u2018The fresh prince of bell air\u2019 and comedians such as Chappelle and Chris Rock were the start of a new generation of insurgences. 3. 0 Rock\u2019s linguistic segregation \u2018Now we\u2019ve got a lot of things, a lot of racism going on in the world right now.

"Powerless is a recurring feeling that Aminata feels throughout the book, The upper class has more power in society and Aminata being a black African American in the 18th century automatically puts her into the lower class due to racism and being a woman. Americans would be able to call people of the African descent discriminatory slurs but Africans would have no right to call Americans white as displaying that Americans are more powerful compared to the Africans."
"Usually after periods of time the urge to search for the attachment figure return and behaviours reappear. Bowlby (1981) comments that, \u201cthe condition of the organism is then one of chronic stress and is experienced as one of chronic distress. \u201d Research into attachment behaviour in babies carried out by Mary Ainsworth and her colleagues (1967, 1974) hypothesised that in an effective attachment relationship the child would use the mother as a base to explore from, would be distressed by her absence and would seek closeness on her return."
"Kenya is a landlocked country in the continent of South Africa. It is surrounded by five countries. Kenya is a popular destination for tourists travelling to Africa as it offers tourists camel safaris, trekking, game fishing, white water rafting, ballooning, diving, wind surfing and donkey safaris. The major ecotourist attraction in Africa is one of the 40 national parks in Kenya that offer an insight into the lives of animals and their habitat. Unfortunately, 70% of national parks and game reserves are on pastoral lands, particularly Masai land."
"The Philippines is currently not ready for death penalty. Our judiciary system, sadly, is anti-poor. As what we can see in our society, poor people get imprisoned, while rich people get away. They simply fly to other country without extradition treaty with the Philippines or bribe officials while the poor don\u2019t have a choice. Death penalty is also against our constitution and our rights as a human being.. The death penalty is unjust and morally wrong. When someone murders someone else, the correct punishment to it is not to murder him or her, but to try and help them. For me, it is just a quick death and a quick punishment. Lifetime imprisonment is better than death penalty because they have to spend their life behind bars and suffer loss of freedom and loneliness. Maybe in that way they will learn of what they have done to the victim of their crimes. Sometimes the justice systems of the Philippines are not fair because for instance there is always a possibility that the person that will be punished by the death penalty is innocent."
"The Canadian community seemed to be aware of this particular issue. Research on Canadian shows that 69 percent of people knew that there was racism in Canada, and nearly half of the responders had heard some people make racist remarks towards some persons. Also, another study that was carried out in Vancouver discovered that 82 percent of people of visible minorities specified that they have been imperiled to prejudice or other kinds of discernment. In order to address this issue, sometime in 2017 the Ontario province announce a three-year premeditated strategy, this compressive disposition was made up of a number of components including legislation, beleaguered community awareness, and edification, and anti-Black racism approach, and focused on indigenous people, anti-racism policy among to name a few which also include the confrontation against racism and discernment."
"It was during this time, however, that some of the women began to speak out. They boycotted in the streets, and their first political act was to simply say \u201cno\u201d. These women\u2019s untraditional behavior surprised many, but it was effective almost immediately. By the mid-eighteenth century, women had become the top consumers and purchasers, so their thoughts and opinions did indeed matter."
"Rewards and room for advancement allow for increased pay from their companies. Economic inflation continues outside of companies, who are experiencing an economic crisis. Economic inflation can increase costs employees need to pay on their living expenses. If an employee has increased living expenses, a salary freeze may force employees to leave to make ends meet. I. Saleem & N. Saleem states that a company can \u201creduce employee\u2019s turnover while focusing on employee motivation factors\u201d (2014). If the company cannot motivate an employee with compensation due to the salary freeze, they must find another motivating factor to satisfy employees at their job."
"This response is in the form of a persuasive speech that might be presented to a group of senior high school students who have begun to ask questions about their identity and belonging, such as \u2018Who am I?\u2019 and \u2018Where do I belong?\u2019 It\u2019s intended audience are adolescents who, as they are trying to discover who they are and where they fit into school, society and on a global scale, are wondering how much influence their appearance has on how they are perceived by others."
"However, do you know? This is what makes me admire him so much. Why? Because with his very difficult conditions at that time, he was never discouraged or continued to dissolve in sadness lamenting the fate of his life. He remained passionate about going through every path of his life with great patience and determination. He who was then living with his first sister who was married, helped pastor his sister-in-law\u2019s goat as a sign of reciprocity because my father lived with his sister\u2019s family at that time. How sad the path of my father\u2019s life."
"Although, in life, we become devoid of friends because of something irrational or we grow apart from them, it can be a heartbreaking. You trusted this person and then they left you without an explanation. From my experience, it may be sad, but it\u2019s a good thing in a way. You learn that you need to change somehow and become a better friend. Maybe you lost a friend because you didn\u2019t listen to them or you didn\u2019t communicate efficiently, you quarreled with them over something irrational, or even having to choose between friends."
"have been seen as measures to prevent unwanted pregnancy among the adolescents. It was recommended among others that sex education should taught as a subject at the secondary level and government should enact laws to compel parents to take proper care of their children to avoid all forms of immorality among the adolescents."
"As a high-ranking Confederate officer, Lee was exempt from many of the legal penalties following the war, and he returned to his Virginia home with hopes of leading the South through Reconstruction and toward accepting reunion with the North. He further cemented his legacy of duty by serving as President of Washington College in Lexington until his death on October 12, 1870."
"In some areas, it is even possible for an immigrant or his descendants to spend a whole life without ever encountering the need to speak French or to let alone familiarize himself with any aspect of the famous French culture. The result is often alienation which in turn gives the radical Islamists an opportunity to propagate their message of religious and cultural apartheid. Some of them are even calling, for the areas where Muslims form a majority of the population, to obtain the right to organize their social, cultural and educational life in accordance with their religious beliefs."
"Although the United states did expressed Nationalism in some ways, all this was forgotten when the country stated to divided it self into different sections with different believes. One of the great differences between these sections was tariffs. Hohn Randolph of congress said in 1816, \u201cWith my goodwill, sir, no one interest agriculturists bear the whole brunt of the was and taxation, and remain poor, while the others run in the ring of pleasure, and fatten upon them\u201d (Document A). What he tried to say is that the high tariffs were unfair to many people. Other only wanted the best for them with out thinking of the rest of the population."
"Similar cases will most likely occur with our good friends too, not as numerous but nevertheless it happens. There are moments when we make stupid decisions and we need someone who knows we are settling for something less than what we deserved to advise us. At the end of the day, a good friend will never leave or forsake you despite all the arguments you both had,"
"The United States is known as the land of the great opportunities. As a result, a major national debate rages over the U.S. government concerning the illegal immigration of people especially from the Middle Eastern countries and Mexico. Sometimes it focuses on the benefits of the illegal immigrants that they have on the U."
"Troy\u2019s resentment about his failures makes him obstinate about the possibility of change of fate, if not for him, for his sons. Troy is perpetually a walking conflict with himself. As part of the generation in Southern America that went through the ordeal of slavery, Troy Maxson struggles to get past the trauma and disappointments. Travelling to the north full of hope to find a better life, Troy had a chance as a ball player but age defied him further glory in the major league and he ends up being a garbage man."
"I would still say that there is no doubting the fact that mothers make better parents as they are known to be more balanced, especially in crunch situations. If we were to take a neutral scenario where the financial pressure and the emotional mess of a broken household are absent, women are capable of dealing superbly with the task. Usually, the women are projected as emotional wrecks, poor decision makers and incapable of providing a secure future only in situations where they are not educated enough to go out and earn. Other than that, there are ample examples where independent single women have done a splendid job of parenting."
"More and more children are forced to child labor because of poverty. They had suffered hunger and thirst, pain in the body and pain in the heart. They had sacrificed their life \u2013 instead of playing they are working, instead of studying they are sweating. Working children are deprived of playing. Children are supposed to play and not to work in sweatshops because being a child doesn\u2019t last forever. They should enjoy their childhood and be happy with his or her amily; yet it is a big wake up call to us all that not all people live within their means."
"The role of marriage and family has changed due to the political perspective of the American government in today\u2019s society families and marriages are face with many more challenges. The family structure has been in constant evolution since its founding. There is no solid meaning of the family unit today. At the time of founding American homes, consist of a family consisted of a husband, wife, biological children and maybe extended family. Divorce was unheard of people who married remain married until their death. Today we are faced with an incline of divorce, single-family homes, some homes with no male figure, and living in poverty. Around the 19th century roles and family, structures began to change due to the government granting specific rights to women. By the 20th century, the government made laws the granted a better well- being for children."
"Nativism was amplified between 1900 and 1930 because Americans feared that their country was beginning to change. The American hate of Germans was caused by the current issues of War, Germans were portrayed as, and many Americans thought that, the Nazi party embodied the rest of German society. Americans were beginning to become confident, comfortable and so set in their values that when different cultures and ethnic groups began to appear Americans were afraid that every slight change made would be a drastic blow to American society."
"Civil wars, often related to ethnic conflicts, have become increasingly common in recent years. They impose enormous and long-lasting human, social and economic costs, and have repercussions well beyond the immediate theater of combat. The aggravation of ethnic frictions to the point of armed conflict can doom many multiethnic societies to periods of prolonged economic, political and social crises, and set back economic progress for decades. The eruption or continuation of these conflicts is obviously a product of a multitude of factors, and each conflict has its own unique roots."
"Religion in this way is promoted as an important asset for all even if they believe from different religions; young people and old, not just as personal interest, but as something that can be used to find peace for one\u2019s mind and soul. These simple encounters from the article have taught me how to be freer to express my faith. More so, it has given me an impression to deal with all things in great fervor all for the love of my religion. Reference Olsen, G. , & Fuller, M. L.

"When I came to Seattle in 2003 I didn\u2019t trust my new mom, I had the idea that she would abandon me as well. I always thought that the reason my mother had surrendered me was because I was the problem. Little did I know it was because she simply just didn\u2019t have the funding to look after me and that she was sick. I didn\u2019t understand why someone would give up their child for alcohol and yes I knew she was sick, but still. Why put a kid who didn\u2019t do anything wrong through all that pain that will endure further down their life. Looking back there was no way that I could come to the United States and automatically fit into an American family and culture."
"In particular, California State University San Marcos has a Standards of Student Contact that lists expectations to avoid situations such as cheating, being involved with drugs, lying to police authorities, ect. These policies revolve around acts that result in major punishment, and does not include civility issues of how students treat each other on campus, or more so the respect that should be maintained in a classroom. The importance of civility on campus and in classrooms should be magnified to create a comfortable, mature environment for students and faculty."
"Desiree having a child with black skin brings the essential factor to the story were the characteristics of Armand clearly show up. The character of Desiree\u2019s husband, Armand Aubigny, is showed as a violent and insensitive person, with a nature based only on his high social status as the only significance in life. Armand starts to be seen as a violent character when he is first introduced: \u201cArmand Aubigny\u201d, his name itself derives from the word \u201carm\u201d in English, related to a fighting perception."
"Whoever got the most questions correct or could complete her worksheets correctly would getjust one starburst. This little incentive to doing our work and learning the material not only made us work hard to get the correct answers, but made the whole learning of the lesson fun and interesting. This to me is a great example of how this knowledge can be helpful in the classroom. After working at the carnival and spending time with the children, I realized that interaction with children is very important. Children in elementary school are very young and need much attention. I constantly had to remind the children that were playing the bean toss that even though they missed the first toss, they still had more chances to go. If I hadn\u2018t of said anything and interacted with them, they would have given up after the first try."
"Another example that supports the impression of propaganda is the anapher of the word \u201ccats\u201d in four of five successive lines, that is like pointing one\u2019s finger at them, showing that they are guilty, insulting them not only with words but also with the help of repetition, that keeps the focus and the attention of the reader on them. In the whole poem, the word \u201ccats\u201d is repeated 13 times in fact. Using sharp, short sentences (\u201cCats spread infections\u201d, \u201cCats pollute the air\u201d), the narrator increases the urgency of his speech. As he goes on, he uses questions (\u201cWhy should they insist on their own language and religion, who needs to purr to make his point?\u201d) and emphases (\u201cDeath to all cats! The Rule of Dogs shall last a thousand years!\u201d) designed to move the reader and bias him in favour of the narrator. When saying: \u201cI blame my headache and my plants dying on to cats. Our district is full of them, property values are falling.\u201d, the narrator scapegoats the cats, assigning blame to them although they are not responsible, thus distracting attention from the need to fix the problem for which blame is being assigned. Although the ridiculousness of his blaming of the cats is obvious to the reader and hence ineffective, it is a method used in propaganda."
"During the first half of 1868, the Great Wizard travelled through his States calling for mobilization. Each of his passages is followed by a wave of violence. Replying to a journalist from Cincinnati, Forrest explained: \u201cNiggers held night meetings, came and went, became very insolent and all the people of the South throughout the state were very worried. \u201cHe is careful not to condemn the expeditious justice of his own activists who, in the name of the \u201cconcern\u201d of American citizens, illegally extract black prisoners from their dungeons and hang them from trees\u2026."
"Aside from this, another detrimental impact of capital punishment is that it only helps to send a message to the people that the justice system is an advocate of revenge particularly on the part of the people who got victimized by heinous crimes. The capital punishment sends a message to the people that the justice system is just there to help the families of the victims of the heinous crimes and not for the accused people who could also be innocent (Kronenwetter 36). This can also be interpreted as a punishment that does not provide any opportunity for the offenders to correct their mistakes. In this case, the justice system can be viewed as partial and biased as it only helps the victims and not the accused party. The lawyers of the accused party will then have to work extremely hard to gather evidence to spare their client from capital punishment."
"People stand on either side of the debate when confronted with the question of the need for the death penalty to prevail in a society. There is much less evidence that deterrence is essentially an outcome of the death penalty and as a result, the punishment should be questioned many times. Even when the deterrence effect of capital punishment may be inconclusive."
"Although this is an instance where Claudio is deceiving others; this is, however, not prevalent, at all, throughout the rest of the play, instead Claudio is the one who appears to be subject to the most deception due to his gullibility and short-sightedness. One example of Claudio\u2019s foolishness is when Don John deceives him into believing that Don Pedro is wooing Hero for himself where in fact he is doing it on Claudio\u2019s behalf; this is also ironic since at the same time Claudio is attempting to deceive Don John and Borachio that he is Benedick, they however have not fallen for it."
"Montag\u2019s quest for happiness in the novel really begins at the end of the story. Montag lost everything, yet had himself truly for the first time. He and his friends approach the bombed city to begin a new city and a new life, filled with freethinking and ideas. His whole concept of happiness has been redefined and is no longer tied to materials, like television. Bradbury wrote this story over fifty years ago but the message is still important. For anyone that seeks happiness, there is no straight line and that losing or winning is based on the perception of the individual."
"As we all grow older it\u2019s easy to become self-absorbed in our own needs and desires. Managing the stress of college, finding the proper career path for your future, all while still leaving time for your friends and social events can prove to be extremely challenging. What if on top of that you were required to volunteer in your community? Sounds like one more thing to add to the long list of things you need to do, but in reality, it could actually be just what the doctor ordered."
"Wildlife law is obligated for many purposes in the protection of wildlife regulations of wildlife use and the offenses individuals in society impose on animals that are found to be unacceptable and do not abide by the laws. Wildlife crime comprises an extensive range of offenses. \u2018Much of UK law in relation to wildlife crime is shaped by international regulations.\u2019 Offenses"
"At the very beginning of the novel, when Obasan and Naomi are\u00a0rummaging through the attic and getting reminded about all of the memories, they come across a family of spiders. These spiders are described as being \u201cround black blots, large as a cat\u2019s eye\u201d (24) and in a sense, disgusting enough to send shivers down any persons\u2019 spine. This description of the black and creepy spiders is a foreshadowing of all of the memories that Obasan and Naomi have, as the memories and the plot itself is quite dark and horrific."
"Montessori, 1966, p38) Maria Montessori believed that during first few years of life its very easy for a child to learn without an effort that later on will be more difficult such as language. She observed that there is an inner passion and urge to absorbed everything from their environment. Sensitive periods are characterized by behaviours such as an activity being irresistible for a child once he/ she starts it."
"Eliot walks up to a line and stops for a few seconds, then he finally steps over the line. The line symbolising life and death, him stepping over the line showed his suicide, jumping off the bridge. At this point everyone who had turned their back on him turned around and held an outstretched arm, as if to try and catch him. After this scene we had to create a scene to show peoples reactions to finding out about his death. We did this using the rest of the group, who had stood there with outstretched arms, forming a line. Each person in turn said something in character as one person from each of the flashbacks we did."
"It stated its priority as reaching the one million people at risk of persistent social exclusion, who have not yet benefited from opportunities that the majority of people can now take for granted. It stated the Government\u2019s intention of tackling deep-seated social exclusion with the help of five guiding principles: Better identification and early intervention; Systematic identification of what works; Better multi-agency working; Personalisation, and rights and responsibilities where appropriate; Supporting achievement and managing under performance."
"I doubt that even a single reader would object if a writer attributed evil characteristics to the devil! Although it may seem like an oversimplified example, I believe it captures the very essence of the attitude of people at the time. That is, because the society had condemned Jews of being the cause of everything bad. Such portrayals are very similar to what Carl Marx has written hundreds of years later, describing Jews as mere worshipers of money."
"The most important advantages is equal rights protection. There is an obvious fact that human cannot choose their sex, the things they can do is receiving and changing people\u2019s perspective on it. It is always said that equal right comes to everyone regardless of gender, race, status. Basically, marriage is the union of two individuals who willingly decide to spend their lives together. Thinking through that heterosexual couples get married, there is no reason why gay couples should not get that same privilege. According to them, gay marriage or the law legalizing it would abolish the unfairness on a significant part of humanity. In that sense, same-sex marriage bring a social equalization. The LGBT community enjoys the same fundamental rights as others, and it would be reasonable to give them the right to marry (Ayres, C. 2019)."
"Time limits and boundaries apply and you do not necessarily have to like the people you work with but need to keep personal opinions and feelings to yourself. Mutual respect and understanding is a key factor in developing a good working relationship. A personal relationship is a relationship formed through choice, with someone who you like, who you may share interests and feelings with."
"The 2001 census indicate that the trend has been slightly arrested with the sex ratio at 933 females per 1000 males, with Kerala at 1058 females. The sex ratio of the 0-6 age group has declined sharply from 945 in 1991 to 927 in 2001. According to UNFPA State of world population 2005, Punjab (793), Haryana (820), Delhi (865), Gujarat (878) and Himachal Pradesh (897) have worst child sex ratio. Facing this problem is not easy at all. We have to make families aware about the importance of girl child for the balance of society."
"In addition , basing on the scapegoating theory in explaining prejudice ,pain and frustration only often evoke hostility for example the native Africans were allocated land in reserves which was very infertile and this led to the First Chimurenga war when the natives fought the whites blaming them for drought and other misfortunes that they were facing as a result of their presence .In contrast to the above theory, Myers(2008) elucidates that the social identity theory in explaining prejudice suggest that individuals in a group come to develop a sense of their identity that is anchored within in-group ."
"I see my father every day in his older age and weary condition, going to work to provide for our family. I can tell and even seethe physical and emotional toll, that life is subduing him. All of this pressure and weight that is put on his back and he still strives through the barriers to provide."
"Victims also report that flagging their credit report for fraud doesn\u2019t always stop the impostor from obtaining more credit\u201d (Identity Theft: How it Happens, 2000). Also, to make matters worst, victims \u201cspend a great deal of time cleaning up the mess\u2026. many\u2026 tak[e] the day or the week off work so they can make the necessary phone calls, write the letters, and get affidavits notarized. This costs them money as well\u2026 In a recent survey we conducted with CALPIRG, we found the average amount of time spent by victims to regain their financial health was 175 hours\u201d (Identity Theft: How it Happens, 2000)."
"With the use of the chimpanzees and orangutans in the medical field, doctors will be able to better test the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical drugs that they create. Because of the fact that these particular primates have a very close similar genetic makeup to humans, means that they are the best candidate. Rats are by far the most readily available, but they aren\u2019t really that close to people, but they are used the most. An article by europa.eu regarding the testing of primates stated that, \u201cresults from research on non-human primates can often be applied to humans, and scientists have learned much about diseases, disorders, prevention and treatments for both humans and animals\u201d (europa.ed, para 1). In simple terms, primates like that of chimpanzees and orangutans are basically a window into the human make up. Everything that is learned through them is transferrable to the human race. If the scientists and doctors are able to find out if their remedies are able work on the chimpanzees and orangutans, then therefore they can adjust the formulas in the medicine slightly so that it will be able to work with the human counterparts. Scientist and doctors can see if the drug will cause any reaction that might be seen as unhealthy, like a flaring up in skin tissue in result to a new pill. Primates like the ones listed are the last line of defense when it comes to curing humanities ailments. \u201cScientists use monkeys only when no other research model can provide the required information\u201d (ncbi.gov, para 8) as states by a primate\u2019s experimentation article from ncbi.gov. Animals like rats are great for testing out how a certain make up remover or nail polish would work for example, but when it comes to medical. Primates should be the only ones that are tested. This is because everything that can be learned and transferred, is done through them. Without them, there is not real understanding and knowledge of the human body. Most of the diseases that have harmed the world would not have been eradicated if not for the testing of chimpanzees and orangutans. Only through that knowledge that scientists gained from the testing of chimpanzees and orangutans, were they able to find what was harming humanity."
"The death of the young child can be seen as part of liberation from the world of racism, but the child is too young far too young to understand race, to have it into her world. But it is also a sacrifice which is too much. Sethe has to forgo too much, as a mother, to protect her children from the cruelty she has lived through."
"During the rise of the Civil Rights struggle, his publications in the 1950s and 1960s spoke on the political upheaval and the conditions of African American Life. This affected the dreams African Americans had for equality. The only thing people had was their dreams, which lead Langston Hughes to write his poems on dreams. Dreams were one of his biggest projects that would relate to the people. \u201cA Dream Deferred\u201d represented the hardship that every American was going through. Black Americans and White Americans loved his poems. Hughes wrote a poem called \u201cHarlem\u201d. Utilizing poetic devices, Hughes is able to successfully display the emotional conflicts of the frustrations that African Americans faced regarding their goals and dreams during the 1950s. One of the most essential poetic devices Hughes uses in \u201cHarlem\u201d is the use of figurative language. Using figurative language, Hughes can evoke a genuine connection with the reader. Written during an era when social equality was more commonly spoken about, rather than acted upon. Hughes did an incredible job of creating visualizations of how African Americans felt about their goals, dreams, and self-esteem. Hughes strategically utilized this poetic device to portray how challenging, and nearly impossible, it was for African American\u2019s to achieve ambitions and goals during an era of social inequality."
"On the other hand in Franz Kafka\u2019s The Metamorphosis, Kafka develops an attitude towards this situation through the use of his protagonist Gregor Samsa and his opinion and feeling towards the topic of family. Gregor\u2019s character shows an individual that will grasps to their ideals and fail to adapt to circumstance in order to please their family. Ibsen, Kafka, and author of \u201cOn Translating Kafka\u2019s \u2018The Metamorphosis\u201d Susan Bernofsky, saw in humanity the plain fact that the character Nora from A Doll\u2019s House and Gregor from The Metamorphosis are the ones that adapt to their surroundings to please there family, are those are willing to keep a deep secret and those willing to go through difficulties for their family."
"(The Coca-Cola Company, 2016)Location: 3851 23 St NE, Calgary, AB T2E 6T2The Coca-Cola Company aims to refresh the world in body, mind and in spirit. To inspire a moment of optimism.Coca-Cola Culture is embedded in the seven core values of the Organization: Leadership, Passion, Integrity, Collaboration, Diversity, Quality, and Accountability.The sales department in Coca Cola is a big team with different players working together to accomplish their goals and meet the target."
"Also, \u201cOne scholar has argued the wording of \u00a7 2250(a) (2) (B) is not sufficiently tailored to support SORNA\u2019s constitutionality under the Commerce Clause\u201d (Morse, 2009). According to the Legal Dictionary, the Commerce Clause is defined as \u201cThe provision of the U. S. Constitution that gives Congress exclusive power over trade activities among the states and with foreign countries and Indian tribe\u201d. The aforementioned obviously pertains to the location of the registered offender, and that he or she must register regardless of where they are, if they are a student, on a tribal reservation, or in a foreign country."
"To sum up, Kafka on the shore is a novel that is indeed charged with deep and complicated themes, metaphorically exploring several elements about human life and identity. Nevertheless Murakami manages to introduce such complexity in a way that the reader is able to understand and interpret his writing using resources such as intertextuality to clarify his take on the subject, or at least the reader is able to suggest he does. With the use of destiny, control and dreams vs. reality the author makes an interesting approach towards the exploration of identity stating that our thoughts are as much part of who we are as our actions, and even a more important part of our selves. Additionally he gives a vast importance to dreams, as they are the reflection of our minds, our true fears and desires. Perhaps he is stating that life should be much more like a dream, and in a way criticizing the conception of reality."
"Additionally Ralph\u2019s dream shows something snake-like \u201cslither down\u201d, showing evil (the snake) infiltrating even his fantasy world, where by the end of the book, the boys turn the island into hell figuratively and physically when Jack\u2019s tribe tries to use fire to smoke out Ralph. The fire, once a symbol of order and cooperation corrupted by the boys to become like the fires of hell Golding also uses other animalistic words to describe the boys beast-like behaviour, for example when Ralph \u201caccepted a piece of half-raw meat and gnawed it like a wolf\u201d, the repetitive flies \u201cbuzz(ing)\u201d that comes from the pig\u2019s head on the stick and the carrion flies around it. The Lord of the Flies tells Simon that I\u2019m part of you, leading him to figure out that the beast is the inner evil in humans like Golding believes."
"The choice made by Amir to sacrifice his morals and rationalize his decisions forever haunts him and makes it harder to escape the power of his own guilt. Amir is clearly an emotionally unstable person, but his resentment towards Hassan is deepened because of his own guilt. Amir feels extreme guilt after he watches his friend get raped in an alley. After witnessing this he feels that he can no longer be in the same room as Hassan. \u201cI\u2019d hear Hassan shuffling around the kitchen in the morning, hear the clinking of silverware, the whistle of the teapot."
"Issues of social inequality are explored through the treatment of both of these patients who undergo similar operations. There is a clear distinction between the professional and optimistic treatment of Mrs Tabe to the neglected and pessimistic treatment of the old lady. This is so touching that it takes the readers thought away from the main issue of racism to the issue of social inequality within Japan. Because of this the issue of racism which is supposed to be the major theme within the novel now becomes a secondary theme."
"Manson \u2018s delinquency rendered him vulnerable to a choice group of people with which to turn up. Sullivan \u2018s position on familiarity in which the kid seeks to get away solitariness and derive a sense of wellbeing by developing a \u201c buddy \u201d or friend ( McMahn, 2009 ) proved awful in the instance of Charles Millis Manson. Although he did happen a buddy while locked up, those types of friends are in containment for a ground that is deemed inappropriate by society. These are non the people with which to construct strong bonds. His \u201c friends \u201d merely exacerbated his delinquency and altered his head ( for the worst ) psychologically. His traumatic experiences and events he witnessed ( e.g. colza, misconduct, unfair effects, and ill-treatment ) through his equals and the grownups in charge of the installation merely proved the erroneous thoughts that plagued Manson."
"Malaysia is a immature state, there is many thing we have to see to understand what are we today, what will be out hereafter. Today Malaysia is in a turning point, where the politic have a new Atmosphere which will straight act upon the \u201c authority-defined \u201d societal world. And the development of cyberspace, autonomy of address aid people to understand their capableness, have the manner to stand up and express thier emotion and their narrative, one believe in the hereafter, when the \u201c authority-defined \u201d and the \u201c everyday-defined \u201d have found a manner to line up, Malaysian will no longer quetion their identiry."
"As per the American Psychological Association (2014), Resilience is the way toward adaptability notwithstanding difficulty, injury, disaster, dangers, or even critical wellsprings of stress. Resilience theory covers a variety of aspects that talk about the effect of testing occasions on people and families and how well they have adjusted to adversities. Research encompassing strength is driven by these inquiries: (1) What is the distinction for kids whose lives are undermined by drawbacks or affliction? (2) How could it be that a few kids effectively conquered serious life difficulties and grow up to lead an able and composed life? The responses to these inquiries would give significant procedures for actualizing the impacts of affliction on kid advancement and prosperity (Masten, 2011)."
"SUMMARY PART 1 It was a story of a boy who was only 17 when he decides to marry his love one. He was dodong, and he love teang so much that he could not wait for the right age to settle down in a relationship that is hard to escape. It\u2019s the \u201cmarriage\u201d. At the age of 17 dodong and teang got married without thinking of the risk being in an uneasy part of life. They just follow what they feel. They don\u2019t think what would happen in their future."
"Play is a puzzle to scientists. Why do animals spend so much time and energy doing such silly things that seem to have no purpose? The struggle for survival in nature is deadly serious. What place is there for activities that don\u2019t help animals eat, grow, and reproduce? Play is also very risky. Animals can break bones, pull muscles, or get bitten too hard. In a study of 14 Siberian ibexes (wild goats), more than one-third were hurt badly enough during play to cause limps-a serious concern in the race for survival. And animals can become so wrapped up in play that they are unaware of danger."
"I believe the death penalty ensures societal safety, brings criminals to book, brings justice to the victims, and deter crimes and reduce the number of criminals. From these illustrations, I believe capital punishment should not be abolished. Capital punishment is necessary to maintain public safety and keep justice shining in the society. It also cuts down the number of convicts on death row. The death penalty relieves families and friends who lose their loved ones in the merciless hands of criminals. It also solves the problem of overcrowding through a humane action. From this account, the death penalty aids in resolving a number of societal criminal issues. Therefore, I take the stance of the pro-capital punishment: I support the reintroduction of death penalty."
"Hank Morgan is a prisoner who has traveled back in time to the sixth century and is sentenced to death before Arthur\u2019s court because of his strange dress and appearance. Before the execution is carried out, he is able to buy his freedom by convincing the Arthur that he is a magician. He relies on knowledge that a sun eclipse will take place before he is executed and he convinces the King that he is the cause of it. Hank is given the highest title in the land and he does not fail to ridicule the people who fear him."
"However, uniqueness is often thought to be linked with the self-centered pursuit of individual desires instead of societal interests. After all, if everyone on our world ended up being an out and out independent, there would be no use of societal standards that link people as social animals. Societal control would be likewise unnecessary in that occasion, seeing that every child, teen, male and woman would firmly insist on doing as he or she pleases without understanding the effects\u2013 which may consist of harm done unto others."
"In many parts of our country (especially in UP, Bihar, Rajasthan, Haryana, Tamilnadu and Punjab), women are viewed as an economic liability despite contributing in several ways to our society and economy. Women in India are victims of the patriarchal ideology that oppresses them. The most disturbing factor is the fact that sex selective abortion is prevalent even amongst the educated class. We need to understand the gravity of this problem before it is too late. There are numerous reasons behind this and mostly are social evils such as dowry system and lack of education and rights for women in India. The government can just provide few more schemes such as literacy programmes for females."
"4. Education/trainings: a successful diversity program will also educate all of a company\u2019s employees to understand the business rationale behind their efforts. That way, the employees who don\u2019t directly benefit from a company\u2019s diversity efforts\u00a0understand that they still have a stake in the program\u2019s success. In addition, encouraging employees to participate in skills-based volunteer projects can help unleash targeted skills.5 5. Mentoring programs: It is important to understand that a company cannot expect to change in corporate culture unless you get your full employee base involved. Partnering lower level employees with senior level employees, including diverse and promising professionals of color mentor-mentee sponsorships, may help facilitate the understanding of working together."
"Furthermore, a patient develops a trusting relationship with the healthcare provider. Competence in cultural communication is critically desirable in Canada where the scope of diversity is wider. 18% of the Canadian population is made up of foreigners. 13% of the population comprises of the visible minority. However, the Aboriginal groups account for approximately 3% of the population (Caron, 2006). The Aboriginal groups in most cases emerge out as victims of a selection of culturally insensitive stereotypes. A specific group of the Aboriginals is the Metis group."
"It is also possible to suggest that the solution must be found in the group that suffered mostly from such situation, which actually is its subject and object. This group is exactly illegal immigrants, whose fate is entirely dependent on market requirements. I consider that, of course, the root of the problem of illegal immigration lies at the bottom of society, gave rise to globalization, do not equalizing, but actually intensifying polarization between rich and poor, both in the scale of individual countries and across the world \u2013 rich countries and poor countries, at the base, gave birth to the racist prejudices and chauvinism, and most importantly \u2013 a demiurge of capital over man. For the solution of our problem today it is necessary to change the essence of the whole society that generated it."
"Personal reasons give people too many excuses to not have their children vaccinated, but leave society as a whole more concerned about their health. Parents should not be able to avoid vaccinating their children for any reason that is wholly detached from science (Tribune). Seven year old Rhett Krawitt, suffering from leukemia, expressed his support along with his family for proposed state legislation that does not allow parents to impose their beliefs as jurisdiction to prevent their children from getting vaccinated before entering school (Law to prevent). Ethical and public policy questions are often raised with Refusal to Vaccinate forms (Phillips). Parents of unvaccinated children are often forced to sign a Refusal to Vaccinate form for some pediatricians. Many Refusal to Vaccinate forms coerce parents to choose an option so their children are not vaccinated, but that option often contains language that ignores some reasons for refusal, such as religious or philosophical. With the heightened controversy, many jurisdictions have seen an increase in the amount of Refusal to Vaccinate forms required, with physicians claiming legal reasons for requiring such forms (Phillips)."
"The Dust Bowl was a time from 1935 to 1938 where colossal sand storms, sometimes miles in length, wreaked havoc on farmers and their land in the Midwest. Because of this, hundreds of thousands of farmers and their families were displaced. Some were forced into homelessness while others were forced to abandon their farms and head west in search of work. Although Of Mice and Men doesn\u2019t specifically mention the Dust Bowl, both George and Lennie are heading west to find work. The cover of the book portrays the two men as they head west. Continuing our look into the past, the next book cover we\u2019re going to talk about its context and analyze is from a reprint of the book in 1993. During the 1990\u2019s the United States had two Presidents, George H. W. Bush and William J. Clinton."
"The ladies immediately start being disrespectful and unfavorable with the white women calling them \u201cwet Chihuahuas\u201d that they smelled bad. The brownies are not thinking about even being familiar with the girls. No matter what the white women would do, the brownies would be frustrated regardless. You can inform that the ladies are very uninformed color/race given that there fourth grade class started utilizing \u201cCaucasian\u201d as a joke whenever the kids felt it suit."
"Lat has prove that being a cartoonist is not all about making jokes, but also to enhance and aware of our own culture, society and current issues at the same time maintain the ethnics harmony and produce artwork without offending other people which is different races and skins. All these elements are crucial in order to enhance the idea of being Malaysian, yet maintain the culture\u2019s identity while preserve the elements of unity between many races."
"Watching these events unfold visually compelled me in way I never quite had been before from an emotional standpoint- the social implications of these events are so much graver and severe than I had even thought previously. As the documentary noted in the third act, racism is so deeply rooted in American soil that one born here or moving here after the most blatant forms of racism have vanished (segregation) finds themselves unwittingly fitting into racialized society."
"Food has a very important role in the culture of Latino\u2019s. In some cultures, food is given as a combination of food and herbs either when hot or cold. Typically, good appetite is linked to good health. The food preferences of children are respected and they are not forced to eat what they don\u2019t want. There\u2019s a belief that a child might fall sick if given food of the wrong temperature. Mothers always withhold food that might cause illness to children. Experience has made them identify a list of harmful foods and this is passed along from generation to generation (Brice, 2001)."
"In classes polyplacophoran and aplacophora have a much simpler muscular organization that is, together with the body wall musculature, mainly it comprises of serially repeated dorsoventral muscles. (Maik Scherholz, 2013). Organisms from class Pelecypods burrow and move from place to another by means of the foot, which can be extended from the anterior end of the shell. (HEGNER)"
"This is one of the reasons that lead him to come up with an idea of building the border wall. He also fears that safety of our country is out of control and there should be taken actions against unwelcomed people. In one of the articles Holpuch, is explaining about the border wall and its main purposes. Keeping the USA apart from the South America, especially from Mexico because of ongoing crimes and poverty would be one of the main reasons."
"Philippe Bourgois comes across as a very credible source, having lived and interacted with the people who have engaged in drug dealing, and have experienced drug-related violence as well as hardships in striving to find their place in mainstream society. In chapter 7 of In Search of Respect, Selling Crack in El Barrio, Philippe Bourgois was able to convincingly show how the very culture spawned by the crack trade can change or transform in a major way\u00a0 not just people\u2019s present aspirations, but also their future social conditions in life."
"For this study mothers/caretakers were asked to provide a 24-h recall of foods consumed by the child both inside and outside the house regardless of the amount consumed. Once the mother completed the recall, we showed her pictures of food groups representing common food items in each category to get the full list of foods consumed by the child. These food items were grouped into seven food groups following the WHO IYCF guidelines. For each child, a binary variable of diet diversity was constructed from the total dietary diversity score to indicate whether the child diet over the last 24?h was adequately diverse. Children were considered to have adequately diversified dietary intake if they had food items from at least four of the seven food groups, while a score of 3 or less was considered to be inadequate(28) in accordance with the IYCF guideline."
"Ethnic Notions is a documentary directed by Marlon Riggs. The title itself explains what the movie is about-impressions of race. Throughout the documentary, Riggs presents the history of stereotypes and shows how they still exist. In today\u2019s society we have become so accustomed with stereotypes that they are considered normal. The movie Ethnic Notations introduces the problem of stereotypes by explaining their origin and history, giving examples, and showing how they still exist today, so that we are no longer fooled and unaware of stereotyping and racism."
"Yet, in 2005 AFN created the Assembly of First Nations, resolution no, 49. Saying that all immigration should freeze until they solve the issues with the First Nations and there \u201cthird world problems\u201d. The Provinces and Immigration Provinces mostly only have a small little bit of control over immigration, the most provinces can do is use the Provincial Nomination Program, where they can control the percentage of immigrants that goes to that province with certain skills. Although, this does not mean that they can control who goes where, it just increases the likelihood they will move there."
"Net overseas migration has doubled from 146,800 in 2005-6 to 298,900 in 2008-9 (Australian Bureau of Statistics [ABS], 2011). Migrants born overseas account for a quarter of the total population with 50% having direct links with relatives born overseas. Nearly 2. 5 million Australians speak a language other than English at home (ABS, 2003a, as cited in Ashman & Elkins, 2009, p. 7). These facts show how much multiculturalism is now an intrinsic part of Australian society."
"The desired effect from Steinbeck may be for the reader to feel sympathy towards Curley\u2019s wife. We learn that Curley\u2019s wife is not an evil figure and only behaves in the way she does, is to grab the attention of the men around her. The other character suffering from severe loneliness throughout the novel is Crooks, the stable buck. He is portrayed to be an intelligent man because \u201che reads alot. \u201d This is alongside Steinbeck\u2019s idea that you don\u2019t have to be intelligent to be rich. But also, Crooks could have been rich if it had not been for the discriminative society that he lived in."
"Class is largely determined factors that influence social, economic and political status of the individual such as employment or occupation, education and qualification, wealth, ownership of property, means of production, etc. Although social class is not deemed to be hereditary, the status of the preceding generation usually influences the next generation which finds it comparatively easy to hold on to the same class or rise up to a higher class. Individuals may move from one class to the other because of change in economic, political and social status. This is known as Social Mobility."
"A diverse community means diverse ways of teaching and being able to work with somebody from a completely different place. Jeremy S Hymen on usnews.com says, \u201cdiversity expands worldliness.\u201d As I stated earlier it forces us to interact with each other, but in most cases, this is not true. People tend to stick to what they know. Means, that when they are needing to ask a question in class a person normally asks who they know or think they know. Rarely does anybody ask the professor. If nobody likes this is nearby, then, and only then they must ask whoever is sitting next to them. I also know this from experience in this class. It is about what is familiar to us. Having diverse teachers means diverse ways of teaching. This means learning more about certain things talked about or things not known about. All from experience. The real world is diverse. Specifically, America and countries like it. A lot of people I know think, everyone benefits when it comes to social media. I think social media does as much damage as it does good. Collaboration with people from various places gives better knowledge and better results. Diversity overall on campus and otherwise is great for the world we are living in. It teaches us how to all get along and work life as one. Unfortunately, the reality is not like this everywhere. I believe if it was we the people everywhere could all live in peace. It is a sad but happy ethosmeans means"
"Another factor taking their normal life away is the lack of privacy (Loftus,1995)( The Other Side of Fame). The paparazzi can be very annoying as they are curious about everything even a sudden sneeze of the stars (Rujuta, 2018). There are millions of people who are journalists, fans always follow and write about them every day, so they have no private time and space with their family or friends without being taken thousands of photos."
"Everyone has a right to live; this phrase is present in the constitution of every country. Even someone who has committed horrific murders cannot be forfeited of this right. Even though there is the counter argument for this that people who have taken other lives must forgo this right They believe that the value of the offender\u2019s life cannot be destroyed by the offender\u2019s bad conduct. Some abolitionists don\u2019t go that far. They say that life should be preserved at all costs, and that those who are in favor of capital punishment are the ones who have to justify their position. Every human being is entitled to receive a second chance in life. Putting a convict behind bars is always a logical option than killing him, as there is a chance that he may improve. People who have served life sentences are reported to have bettered their earlier ways of living and have made worthwhile contribution to the society. Also capital punishment puts great amounts of strain on the person who is receiving the capital punishment, the person who is killing the perpetrator of crimes, the victim who must watch the criminal be executed and the person who has sentenced the criminal to the death penalty and all their loved ones."
"While five in ten of us are positive about cultural diversity, four in ten are ambivalent about cultural diversity. One in ten have racist attitudes (Source). One in seven people living in Australia are against the concept of multiculturalism (Source). Three in ten people do not believe that immigrants make Australia stronger (Source), and one in three believe there are some cultural groups that do not belong in Australia (Source: VicHealth 2007)."
"If there is only one candidate, he becomes king if he receives at least five affirmative votes from the other rulers; otherwise, a new candidate is sought. When there is more than one candidate, the ballots are taken in the order of a rotation system. The ruler of the last of the nine states to be represented in the kingship since independence, Sultan Azlan Shah, was elected in March 1989. As in most parliamentary systems, political power resides in the cabinet, headed by the prime minister."
"In addition, the concept of brotherhood is in the flashbacks being shared throughout the story. The flashbacks in Sonny\u2019s Blues is one of the most important aspects of getting to know the relationship between Sonny and the Narrative. Most of Sonny\u2019s Blues conflict appears in flashbacks that are being made by the Narrative about his time and experience with young Sonny near the time of their mother\u2019s death."
"However there activities that contribute more to overall brain development are music, art and physical activity. Introduce new materials to children that help them learn new skills and provide a little challenge for them. All this is vital in child\u2019s sensitive periods. Learning Montessori observations of sensitive periods and prepared environment gives us a great start in understanding child\u2019s early years of physical and intellectual development. We now know how important it is to recognize and meet children needs at that time."
"Six year old Lauren Wright (2000) was one such child; she was systematically beaten, mentally abused and slowly starved. In these types of cases culpability is often placed upon Social Services for not removing the child from the family unit, sometimes justifiably too. However, practitioners must seek to promote parental responsibility and aim to keep the child within the family unit. Whilst they may hold suspicions of abuse, without actual proof there is very little that they can do, except remain vigilant. These types of conflicts can lead to ethical dilemmas. Ethical dilemmas occur when a social worker sees herself as facing a choice between two equally unwelcome alternatives\u201d (Banks, S. 2006). Not all ethical dilemmas arise through suspicions of child abuse however, and what may be an ethical dilemma for some practitioners, may not be for others. An example of such an ethical dilemma as explained by Bennett (2008) is as follows: An 11 year old boy lives with his mother and father. Social Services have become involved as there is a history of volatile relations between the father and boy."
"Another relevant statistic is obesity causes up to four hundred and twenty thousand deaths per year. Neither tobacco smokers nor obese people have been punished yet many drug users are imprisoned. Another point prohibitionists suggest against the use of drugs is that drugs harm one\u2019s quality of life however many other things harm one\u2019s quality of life such as dropping out of high school or working at the same job your entire life; all of these are choices people make and the only choice that is persecuted is doing drugs, the others are considered ridiculous to persecute. The money that drug users use on money is equivalent to those who gamble or spend it on frivolous things leaving both lives at smaller quality, yet the drug users are persecuted. Although the use of drugs has the same affects on other people\u2019s life choices drug users are persecuted and people who make equally life-threatening choices are left to make those choices with no persecutions."
"When it comes to the time where the child is starting school for the first time, they don\u2019t know what to expect from all the new things they learn and all the people they meet. When at school children tend to learn a load of new things and they will put energy into work as well as putting energy into meeting and getting to know people. They will learn a lot and this will only increase through life."
"Medical information should not be disclosed to sales or research people whether solicited via telephone or in person. While medical forms from your doctor require an extensive amount of personal and family medical history, the patient should recognize that the law requires that the doctor patient relationship pertaining to medical records is one of great confidentiality. Additionally, the human resources department where an individual was previously and is currently employed should take effective measures to secure employee data provided on resumes, insurance documents and bank accounts."
"Because of Pap\u2019s abusive nature and drunkenness, Pap fails Huck in providing Huck with a set of beliefs and values that are consistent and satisfying to Huck, making Pap fail as a father figure in another way. Although Pap is a hideous, hateful man in nearly every aspect, Huck does not immediately abandon him when given the chance. Huck is grasping on the final thread he has of family. Huck truly believes in the sense of family, and desperately wants it, but at the same time, is scared by the idea (won\u2019t let Widow Douglas close)."
"Singhji says:\u2019 It was then I realized that, having given up my identity, I\u2019d become like the viewer of a movie who weeps for the characters on the screen but cannot help them.\u2019 (313). The reason behind this discrimination is that Singhji is not a member of the high class Chatterjee family. The society always exploits such people and look down at them with contempt. In The Vine of Desire which follows the story of Sister of My Heart, the condition is nonetheless different."
"All of this sounds ideal and easy to apply; then again, the world\u2019s increasing globalization requires more interaction among people from diverse cultures, beliefs, and backgrounds than ever before and it is not always easy. As a result, managing diversity has become an organizational challenge. People no longer live and work in a guarded organization; they are now part of a worldwide economy with competition coming from practically every continent. As a result, maximizing and capitalizing on workplace diversity has become an important matter for management."
"More or less, behavioral problems distinctively fall into two categories of internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Under the category of externalizing behaviors that occur in children, they tend to exhibit more aggressive behaviors and are more likely to engage in trouble within their schools and communities ranging from sudden outbursts to fights . They are susceptible to getting involved in behaviors that are not ideal due to the fact that they\u2019ve been conditioned to think that acting out through a form of aggression is an acceptable concept as a means of solving problems. This conditioning of thought occurs from witnessing the violent behavior from their parent which physiologically makes it okay for them to follow their footsteps. Often times, the perpetrators of many households have been exposed to domestic violence while growing up which led to them falling into the continuous cycle of engaging in violent behavior."
"Crooks was treated like a piece of dirt. A polite, hardworking man who was looked down on beyond the statuses of the horses. He was a punch bag for the boss as he was an easy target and no-one would care any less. Compared to other black people in America, Crooks was lucky. The audience may not realise this but if you look at the other black people in America, Crooks had a place to stay every night; food that he could eat and some money he earned working."
"Friends, one of television\u2019s most popular sitcoms, is about a group of friends in New York living life by the day. It consists of six main characters, three females and three males. We have siblings Monica and Ross Geller, Rachel Green, Chandler Bing, Joey Tribbiani, and Phoebe Buffy. The show was created in the 90s with its first episode airing in 1994."
"This further highlights to the reader the special friendship between George and Lennie which is verbalised by \u2018The Boss\u2019 when he states \u201cWell, I never seen one guy take so much trouble for another guy. \u201d It is through \u2018The Boss\u2019 that Steinbeck demonstrates George and Lennie\u2019s friendship to be rare and special, which is a something that Steinbeck values very highly and he shows this through the plot. In contrast it is also shown that men do need someone to be close to, as Crooks, who is shunned and segregated from the rest of the workers, says: \u201cS\u2019pose you didn\u2019t have nobody\u2026 A guy goes nuts if he ain\u2019t got nobody. This loneliness, which is physically fuelled by the workers\u2019 inability to form lasting friendships since they are constantly on the move, is also psychological as there are many social barriers that prevent the men from experiencing or expressing empathy. Which Steinbeck shows in the bunkhouse scenes; the ranch workers having become so vigilant about protecting their secrets and their own skins that they were unable to reach out to fill the void of loneliness."
"Native?born Americans were troubled by the influx of foreigners, who seemed scary from earlier immigrants because earlier immigrants spoke English new immigrants were often portrayed as dangerous radicals ready to undermine the American political system or as threats to the jobs of American workers because of their willingness to settle for lower wages. Boston had changed majorly from being the merchant city to the industrial metropolis."
"We all acted very childish and how you would expect very young children to react on stage in front of all their mums and dads. In our second scene, playing in the playground, Eliot and Ruth were playing with a skipping rope, Katie was playing hopscotch alone and I was running away from Georgina who was chasing me in a game of \u2018tig\u2019. For our third scene, on the bouncy castle, we were all bouncing happily apart from Ruth who is sitting on the edge, too scared to go on it."
"\u2018work and aim to improve my surroundings like the Catholic Charities do. Asa student at Seton Hall, I expect to discover new pursuits and interests that will better prepare me for an increasingly diverse and demanding workforce. Although my path might be filled with challenges, I expect to be ready to overcome them, and later, make positive contributions as a lawyer with a conscience."
"Immigration played a very important role in American history, and like I stated before, it is perhaps one of the greatest controversial issues of our present time. Yes, I will continue to feel saddened by the experiences that so many people live. My belief is that we are all created equal and we all come from the heavens above, but unfortunately the world is different for all of us, and not always are we all free to live our lives as we choose."
"I hope I have accomplishhed a detailed description of, yes, what I think was a typical factory. There were of course other factories with very different standards and expectations. An example of this would be, not starting working under 10 years so that the child ccould acquire a decent education for five years before starting work. Robert Owen believed that if you put your best into the care of his mill workers he would get the most out of them, in that they would work harder and more efficiently."
"The first cause in creating unhappy uncommunicative families is financial problems. Financial problems not only bring stress to the family but also bring a lack of bonding. Many families go out once in a while but when having financial problems it\u2019s hard to do so. For example, going out for a nice family dinner every Sunday night can bring families closer together and can be a great way to communicate, but it\u2019s hard to even do that when there is no money for it. Another example of why financial problems make families unhappy is because families like to go out once in a while to have fun, especially if there are very young ones in the family. Kids love to go out and have fun, but not being able to take your kid out to have fun is unhappy to the kid and hurting for the parent. Couples argue frequently over financial problems. The wife wonders were all the paycheck went and always says the money was not spent wisely when it\u2019s time to pay the house bills."
"Witnessing, participating or being subject to domestic violence would all have negative consequence and especially adverse consequences for children. There are socio demographic correlates of children who witness domestic violence and this could have an association with mental disorders both as children and as adults (Meltzer et al, 2009). The traumatic effects of experiencing domestic violence were found to be related to biographic, socio-demographic and socio-economic characteristics and the report stated that at least 4% of children are regularly subject to domestic abuse. The factors hat could cause greater likelihood of domestic violence would be mixed ethnicity, physical disorder, several children in family, divorced parents, living in rented accommodation, poor neighbourhoods, the mother\u2019s emotional state and family dysfunction. A greater likelihood of the child witnessing domestic violence has been associated with conduct disorder although this was not associated with emotional disorders and there has been an association of domestic violence and emotional disorders so that with witnessing of domestic violence social workers and policy makers could identify the needs of the children who witness domestic violence."
"More interesting still was learning about the laws that defined race in the nineteenth century, and the great lengths Asian and South Asian people went to in justifying that they should be considered Caucasian to gain citizenship in the US. In the case of the Japanese man who committed suicide after having his citizenship rejected, the courts used race as an indicator of values rather than actually observe the actions of the people seeking citizenship. How ironic was it that prior to India gaining independence from Britain in 1947, that families fled to the US where \u201call men are created equal\u201d only to be denied citizenship based on their race? This is so sadly indicative of so much of the inequality still evident in this country today."
"Parents who are selfish have a big effect on children. The way children are raised all depends on the parents. If they aren\u2019t a good parent to your children and let selfishness get in the way of raising their children the right away it can have a large impact on the children\u2019s lives in the future. When becoming a parent your job then becomes being a parent first over everything. Having a family means you do everything you can for the family even if it involves putting other things before your personal wants and desires."
"Victorian attitudes for females were too have children, clean the house, do the cooking and were left uneducated. They were not allowed to go out and work an earn money for the family. In Victorian times they were extremely sexist. This had a huge effect on most of the Victorian ladies an their lives."
"The wife to which the handmaid served, had in the past given, \u201cspeeches about the sanctity of the home, about how women should stay home. Serena Joy didnt do this herself, she made speeches instead, but she presented this failure of hers as a sacrifice she was making for the good of all.\u201d Now, \u201cShe stays in her home, but it doesnt seem to agree with her \u2013 How furious she must be, now that shes been taken at her word.\u201d(p. 43) Before the Sons of Jacob took over, there were many reasons why people were no longer having children at the normal rate. First, the pollution, diseases, nuclear problems and resulting mutants deterred people from having children because the future looked pretty bleak. Secondly, crime rate was very high, with most of them being sexual atrocities. Women and children were in danger, yet many people denied that such things could ever happen to them, and did nothing to stop it. Thirdly, everyone had become very materialistic. People spent their whole lives striving to be the best and have the most, giving no thought to others, and having no time or money for children. People were afraid to bring a child up in a world such as it was, and abortions and birth control devices were common. The blame, however, was placed on the women, since they could choose whether or not to bear children. Yet people still were desperate for children, and wanted them at any cost. \u201cI turned around and she was disappearing down the aisle, in the arms of a woman Id never seen before\u2026 I thought it was an isolated incident, at the time\u2026\u201d(p. 59) Once the Sons took over, this became the norm. Children were taken from women who were deemed unfit, and given to people who would raise them \u201cright\u201d."
"Moral values is the\u00a0concept\u00a0of\u00a0right behavior, nice\u00a0character, and the body of moral qualities and\u00a0virtues\u00a0as described in\u00a0Islamic religion. The main and fundamental purpose of Islamic\u00a0morality\u00a0is\u00a0the love for\u00a0God\u00a0and His creatures. Our religion concept says that mankind will behave morally and\u00a0treat each other in the best possible manner\u00a0as ordered from Allah Almighty."
"Crooks tries to use persuasive language in order to insult Lennie and take advantage of his condition. \u201cSp\u2019ose George don\u2019t come back no more(\u2026 )what\u2019ll you do then? \u201d Crooks takes the chance to fight back from how he has been tortured in the past. He also wanted to make Lennie feel how he has been feeling for most of his life; lonely and isolated. Yet Lennie tries to fight back and Crooks gets scared and tries to carm him down. Crooks is also presented as powerless, as previously discussed it is perhaps this lack of power that leads to his bitterness."
"In order to promote the image of my business I must use the necessary and most effective advertising, to promote both what the arcade provides and also show how it is competitively better than other rival firms. The image that I would like to be promoted of my arcade is one of high quality at competitively low prices. As well as providing a friendly service to build up a high customer loyalty."
"In my personal life experiences I have had a lot of problems not showing respect to my superiors or to my elders who I feel that disrespect me, respecting somebody can be as simple as saying good morning maam or good morning sir. If you show people respect then nine times out of ten that person who you showed respect to not even knowing them will give you the same amount of courtesy and respect that you showed them."
"\u201cSelf-respect means knowing that you are equal to every other being on the planet\u201d (Morand). We use Self-Respect to make decisions and Self-Respect also answers for our actions and mistakes. In the Story \u201cOn Self-Respect\u201d author Joan Didion explains the importance of Self-Respect and what would happen to us if we were to have no Self-Respect for our self. The reason behind Self-Respect also ties in with the importance of Self-Esteem, but differ in some parts. My points on to the reasons why we need self respect is that it Motivates us, it gives us a sense of mutual respect for one another, and it gives us the feeling of success and conquer."
"Opponents would have you believe that it is okay for animals to be tested on so that humans and sometimes animals would suffer less in the future, however, \u201cWe should be concerned about how animals are treated in research, and [\u2026] eliminate the number of animals who suffers\u201d (ASPCA). Researchers are concerned only with their results and not the harmful process it takes to get them. It is clear that not only is animal testing cruel and necessary, but ineffective. However with alternatives to testing and strategies of protest, it\u2019s possible for us to begin to diminish animal testing."
"The table compares the average ______ of time per day that men and women in the UK spend ______ different activities. It is clear that people in the UK spend more time ______ than doing any other daily activity. Also, there are significant differences between the time ______ by men and women on employment/study and housework. On average, men and women in the UK ______ for about 8 hours per day. Leisure ______ ______ the second largest proportion of their time. Men spend 5 hours and 25 minutes doing various leisure activities, such as watching TV or doing sport, ______ women have 4 hours and 53 minutes of leisure time. It is noticeable that men work or study for an average of 79 minutes more than women every day. By contrast, women spend 79 minutes more than men doing housework, and they spend ______ ______ as much time looking after children. Fill the gaps using these words: doing, up, over, spent, while, sleeping, sleep, twice, amount, takes Goods consumer"
"No changes are suggested in relation to stop and search power, which the reason is not suggested. Changes in stop and search practices are, however, can be observed, as stated in Miller\u2019s (2010) evaluation. Apart from periodically publishing stop and search records, supervisors and managers of police force are now required to closely monitor such statistics and take timely actions if something wrong is being observed. Also stricter rules on stop and search have since been imposed, along with the requirement of police officers writing a detailed report on spot about every single incident which subjects to review seems helpful in improving police conduct (Fyfe 1979; Skogan and Frydl 2004 in Miller 2010). While stop and search practice has been somehow improved, racial discrimination can still be seen in stop and search statistics. The notion of \u201cBlack and minority ethnic groups, particularly black people, have for many years been disproportionately at the receiving end of police stop and search\u2014a fact associated with profound community resentment towards the police\u201d (Bowling and Phillips 2002 in Miller 2010) still largely applies today."
"Police brutality has been around since policing was first designed in 1829 by Sir Robert Peel, and technology has only helped expose police behavior by allowing people to post their videos on the web for everyone to see. People have been able to use technology to their advantage by capturing part of the incident and making the officer seem corrupt and unethical. Because of this dilemma, police agencies have adapted to using body cameras on their officers, to decrease the amount of excessive force officers use against the public."
"I think this shows perfectly Cassie\u2019s character \u2013 she needs to belong yet fails to do so, she strives to connect with people, but cannot seem to achieve her goal. She makes up \u201csentimental fictions\u201d, as she has no sentimental memories of her own to reflect upon. Her past experiences with people had a negative effect on Cassie; these experiences break into the present through memories and photographs and have a similar effect to the extracts:"
"Next comes Test the first time heard the new word \u201cfeminazi\u201d, a term that grew out of the blue to become out for working mothers who clearly deal with their children like pups (because they don\u2019t have any other option left if they even want to consider about themselves)! What\u2019s more, indeed, terms, for example, \u201cbreastfeeding nazi\u201d, \u201cbreastapo\u201d, or \u201cmilk mafia\u201d additionally come enveloped with the alarm melody of mom life."

"Gaining a positive public image is an important step towards the change that Ryanair needs to implement. Having a positive public image is a major boost in the success of any business (Caruana and Chircop 2000, pp 45-50). Given the large European market that Ryanair operates in, embracing a positive public image will enhance its chances of success. Firstly, the management of the company needs to develop organizational management frameworks that control the resources of the company with utmost proficiency. The management of the company is vital in disseminating a company\u2019s functions to the relevant parties. The management, being a major stakeholder in the company has the obligation of ensuring that the internal environment of the company is articulating management issues vehemently. This calls for the employees to work collaboratively with the management in affecting the external stakeholders positively. The effective business communication grounding between the management and employees will produce results that will precipitate positive publicity for Ryanair."
"As dimension of modernity has bring changed in the ideology of people when it comes about a new sexual identity emerged (LGBT). The contradiction was that section 377 is now abolished but earlier according to this section sexual acts against the order of nature is considered crime, it simply implies that how patriarchal notion of heterosexuality\u2019s management is forced by a law to continued them legally. But now after the abolishment of this law, it gave freedom to LGBT but due to patriarchal rules which are still exist in our families it will be hard full for them to live their way as they want for example in movie like \u201cek ladki ko dekha to aisa lga\u201d how Sonam Kapoor fights for her sex interest."
"Any sort of\u00a0development\u2014whether economic, political, biological, organizational or\u00a0personal\u2014requires a\u00a0framework if\u00a0one wishes to\u00a0know whether change has actually occurred. In\u00a0the case of\u00a0personal development, an\u00a0individual often functions as\u00a0the primary judge of\u00a0improvement, but validation of\u00a0objective improvement requires assessment using standard criteria. Personal development frameworks may include goals or\u00a0benchmarks that define the end-points, strategies or\u00a0plans for reaching goals, measurement and assessment of\u00a0progress, levels or\u00a0stages that define milestones along a\u00a0development path, and a\u00a0feedback system to\u00a0provide information on\u00a0changes."
"Starting from considering how to best allocate my childhood toys, I have always been fond of making things better. With this interest in mind, I began to pave my way toward becoming a top consultant aiming to help people make optimal decisions. My hands-on experiences with real world problems have greatly shaped my commitment to, and passion for, this field."
"Gregor suggests here that the best thing he can do is to not be a burden and hide himself like a deep secret from society, which might be wise considering that everything he does is interperted as an attack.\u2019It was necessary he should have no idea what a dangerous condition he was in. It was to me that the doctors came and said that his life was in danger\u2019 ( Ibsen 193). Nora\u2019s main concentration is keeping her lies from Torvald Helmer as an act of love. She is willing to keep her dark secret in order for Helmet to be happy and satisfied. Many believe friends and relationships might come and go but the idea of family is that they would always be there for you no matter the times of hardship."
"Though he was at his peak in the American Revolution, leading his cavalry as an American hero, he eventually fizzled out, ended up in debtor\u2019s prison, and fled from his debt by escaping to the West Indies, leaving his family without a backward glance. Lee\u2019s mother, Ann, showed no animosity toward the awful man, and continued to raise her family with love and affection. Lee saw his father for the last time at the age of six. The American hero and loser Light-Horse Harry died on his way back home when his injuries from a beating he took several years prior caught up with him and his bad health brought him down. This happened when Lee was eleven, and Light-Horse Harry never lived to see his family again. Growing up with no father figure did not stop Lee in the slightest. He loved his mother with a fierce passion, and was her favorite child as well as her confidant and nurse."
"\u2018The Kray Sisters\u2019 also show their dislike of some of the other women in the firm, who are \u2018well out of order\u2019, get \u2018engaged\u2019 or become \u2018some plonkers wife\u2019. In \u2018Queen Herod\u2019, the Queen welcomes three Queens to the palace, they bring gifts for her newly born baby girl, the Queen swears to protect her daughter from male exploitation and orders the death of all sons in her land. When the three Queens come to visit Queen Herod they warn her to look out for a \u2018star in the East\u2019, signalling the birth of a boy and the omen of male domination."
"The ever changing ideals of the typical American family dynamic has given rise to a new wave of ideas pertaining to our society, and how it is moving steadily towards the romanticized culture that is portrayed in Fahrenheit 451. Consequently, the change in ideals has given rise to slitting families along with differing gender roles and unreasonable expectations on couples to center their lives off of the ideas of past ideals. As we move further in society and become more independent on ourselves we move further and further from the past ideas of a nuclear family."
"We firstly had to brainstorm what we thought linked to childhood in the room. The hopscotch, the baby, the nursery books and the children playing on the video all tie into the childhood theme. All these objects relating to childhood had a sense of innocence and youth. We brainstormed significant memories of our own childhood and chose 6 ideas to create scenes upon. Our group came up with many ideas for this but the 6 ideas we chose were: * * A school nativity play. * Playing in the school playground. * On a bouncy castle at a party. * Learning to ride a bike. * Writing letters to Father Christmas. Telling scary stories at a sleepover. We firstly had to create tableaux images or short scenes of these memories. For our first scene, the nativity play, our group all stood in a line as if on stage at a school play. Georgina and Katie were arguing loudly about the role of Mary shouting, \u2018I wanted to be Mary! \u2018, Ruth played a young girl, transfixed by the audience, smiling stiffly and waving, I played a young boy on stage desperately needing the toilet and dancing about ready to wee myself at any moment and Eliot played a young boy who walked off stage half way through."
"While a lot of people are unaware of the impacts that a U.S \u2013 Mexico barrier could potentially have on the environment, experts suggests that it could potentially be devastating. Because the U.S \u2013 Mexico barrier crosses through a Wildlife Refuge in Texas, as well as one in Sonora, it could potentially interfere with the migration of animals from point A, to point B. In addition to that, building a barrier also brings about a tremendous amount of pollution which is also harmful to the environment."
"In order to help in a proactive capacity; as well as, be a catalyst that will spur on legislature and rights for children in a domestic violence situation, Lighted Pathways is a program that will be implemented in order to support children who live with violence and ensure a better tomorrow. Though it is said that children are resilient, it is imperative for them to be given an opportunity to thrive. Opportunities that allow for the child to create healthy bonds with adult, secure activities with peers, and gain a voice for themselves in a secure and protective environment will be provided."
"Another rule that must be observed to build a happy and harmonious family is not to take out the dirty linen. For some reason in our time it is customary to share details of kin life with friends, relatives or even a psychologist, revealing all the nuances of family life. This is a big mistake since everything that a family lives on must remain within the family. This will help to cultivate power in the family. And if you endure kin happiness outside the family, then this force will gradually decrease, bringing quarrels and conflicts into the family."
"During the pre-conventional Stage, Belle is responsive to the rules set out by her parents and is either deemed to be either good or bad or right or wrong. If she does not listen to her mother, she will be punished. These will be indicated to her that there are certain rules in the house that needs to be met and must be followed."
"Mr Edwards pleaded guilty to defensive homicide and was sentenced to 9. 5 years imprisonment and non-parole of 7. 5 years. Describe some criticisms that have been made of defensive homicide. Some criticisms that could be made against defensive homicide could be that defensive homicide is being misused on the basis that it has been used almost exclusively by men who kill other men, and not for those for whom it was intended. Defensive homicide was introduced as a \u2018safety net\u2019 for women who kill their violent abusers once provocation was abolished."
"The structural-functionalist perspective tries to identify its function for society. Structural functionalism has a key point that revolves around a unified stable whole system that is made of orderly functioning structures that contribute to the stability and equilibrium of the society as a whole. One of the advantages of functionalism is its inclusion of all social institutions, of which family is one; in an attempt to provide a universal social theory that explains society in one comprehensive model."
"Consider the theme of loneliness in \u2018Of Mice and Men\u2019. How does it impact the relationships and relationships in the book? This novel was written by John Steinbeck which was set in the 1930s in Salinas Soledad which remains in California. The unique includes lots of historic elements which have affected the characters in this unique and among them consists of, \u201cThe terrific anxiety\u201d Which leads the books motivation for the popular author John Steinbeck which he mainly based on his own experience."
"The text for Rutter\u2019s The Falcon was drawn from the Old and New testaments, ancient chant and a 15th-century poem that provided the falcon imagery. The music is challenging for the singers but is very approachable for listeners. Some 200 musicians, including the children, prepared superbly by Sandra Mathias, were brilliant in this little-known but strong and colorful composition. The final group of four pieces was expertly done and enjoyable, but they were a letdown compared with the rest of the program. Columbus Symphony Orchestra trumpeter Tom Battenberg, was attractive. Two of Copland\u2019s Old American Songs were delightful, but my mind was still hearing Mozart and The Falcon."
"Surveys done by the New Delhi Operations Research Group in 1991 indicated that as many as 72 percent of rural parents continue to have children until at least two sons are born; the preference for more than one son among urban parents was tabulated at 53 percent. Once these goals have been achieved, birth control may be used or, especially in agricultural areas, it may not if additional child labor, later adult labor for the family, is deemed desirable. A significant result of this eagerness for sons is that the Indian population has a deficiency of females."
"However, the practitioner is also responsible for identify areas of structural oppression and discrimination. They must aim to seek change in society and act as an advocate for those in need. Therefore they must identify areas of oppression and discrimination to those in power. Practitioners are responsible for services to humanity; they must help clients meet their personal and social needs; thus enabling them to develop their potential. In order to do this however it requires the client to acknowledge that they are in need, it would also require them to want to develop their potential."
"In conclusion, for people who are out the prison, the education and the protection of our rights are two keys to prevent that our prison are full and for people are in a prison, re-educating in the knowledge which are their rights, their obligations or responsibility to live in a society."
"An example of society rewarding a person for digression from social norms would be if a woman shaves her head in honor of someone who is battling cancer. A woman who wears men\u2019s clothes, has a shaved head, and is not at all feminine would be an example of a person that society would punish for digression from social norms.\u00a0Women should be free to do as they please. Not only is a person\u2019s appearance what the people in today\u2019s society pays attention to, but the responsibilities a woman does as apposed to what a man does, such as household chores including cooking, cleaning, laundry, and raising the children. Many people look down upon women who do not take care of those responsibilities, then others get angry when women feel as though they are responsible for these chores. Many women are influenced by women to do these responsibilities because they were taught to them by past generations. The people in our society worry so much about everybody else\u2019s flaws when each person should worry for themselves and not what others please to do."
"There are a few different reasons why body cameras are shown to be useful. First of all, body cameras can be used for evidence. The public won\u2019t be able to point their fingers and blame police officers if that police officer has specific evidence to what actually happened during the crime. Another reason why body cameras are useful would be because they could be used as a type of fear factor."
"But, with her family\u2019s financial situation now limited to a single income, Ann moved her it closer home to Alexandria, Virginia in 1810 after Henry bargained with President James Madison for passage aboard a ship bound for the West Indies\u2014perhaps to evade his growing list of creditors or perhaps for an exotic cure to his crippling ailments. He died before ever returning home."
"In the lower classes there was likely to be less of an age gap, and the husband and wife had usually both worked as servants before they married. Therefore they had a basis for a relationship. I also got to witness a household through my stay in which they started calling their household a family. This was a new term that was becoming more common during this time period. As observed, I noticed that the most common households were based on one married couple and their children. Another common type, I found among people was using a system of inheritance in which property was passed to a person that has been termed the stem family household. The person who gets the property remains in the household with the parents after he or she married, forming a second family that might produce a third household generation."
"Gloria Dula has published 20 papers, including 3 corrections and this her first on immigration. The main purpose of the paper was to propose new tactics in keeping illegal immigration down. According to the journal, by putting more funding into strengthening its own internal and border control and the foreign aid given to some countries you would be able to minimize illegal immigration. The authors think this tactic will work because \u201cthe negative impact on the well being of the majority of voters motivates rick countries to take measures against illegal immigration.\u201d (Dula, Kahana, and Lecker 317) The paper also states that \u201cthere is little doubt that illegal immigration is a troublesome phenomenon for rich countries sense the illegal immigrants do not pay taxes, are often involved in clandestine activities and are unable to obtain jobs in which they may be noticed\u201d (Dula, Kahana, and Lecker 316)"
"The fact that these lines are repeated and indented tells us how strongly Nichols feels about the injustice of stereotyping. In \u201cA Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry\u201d the general portrayal of white people is negative. There are many parts in the book that imply that black people were treated like second- class citizens."
"Chapter Four: Conclusion In the forth chapter, I summarize my whole debate and conclude it with extensive critical analysis on the matter of debate. I hope I will reach to a good, reasonable opinion; which can be helpful for deprived part of our society. Because I believe that adoption or fostering are not the appropriate solutions for giving a good life to illegitimate child or making orphan supporting welfare organizations for taking care of them. Methodology"
"Lastly, the rational souls are souls which are capable of not just nutrition and growth, not just senses, but also rationality, from which human beings are capable of. In other words, human beings capability to rationalize makes him different to the rest of the creatures. Next, human beings need to know his function, and that function is very much related to his nature, and that is human beings capacity to rationalize, therefore human beings function is to think and will, to rationalize."
"The areas that influence my current and future professional development are; procuring an appointment for a job, especially an important job, my calling a strong feeling that you must do a particular type of job, especially one that you consider morally well, collaboration the process of my counseling career now and in the future to produce by working together with people, being able to function professionally, my particular responsibility, job security knowing that the knowledge that is gained and future educational training will allow me to have a permanent career, prospects networking and forming different relationships for chances of success, especially in the career of my choosing lastly, work experience establishing training experience and skills that you gain in doing a particular job setting up for future career (Macmillan Publishers Limited, (2009-2014)."
"Depressed and suicidal children and adolescents are often not identified. Identification of children and adolescents who express suicidal ideation or suicidal acts is crucial since such symptoms are recurrent and strong predictors of youth suicide. Other risk factors for youth suicide behavior have been described including family, other environmental and biological factors. Notably, family history of suicidal behavior increases risk for youth suicide (Rapoport, 2000 p.231)."
"My parents always made sure we stayed involved in multiple community activities, helping others in any way that we could. We had a yearly Christmas family tradition and we would volunteer to sing at various nursing homes during the holiday season. Some of the elderly would sing along with us. The smiles on the residents\u2019 faces were priceless. It meant so much to me and my family to know that the sound of our voices was bringing them so much joy."
"She is awestruck at Labang\u2019s strength and horns. Leon helps her on the cart and she sits on a bale of husk. They start their journey and Leon has the reins. After going a little further, Baldo takes the reins and takes a sudden route change into the rocky road of Waig and surrounding fields. Leon enquiries about the change of route and Baldo assure him that he is only following their father\u2019s orders."
"Currently this fish is taken into account as an31 endangered species because of reduction of the natural feeding and spawning ground along32 with temperature change and human intervention (IUCN Bangladesh, 2000). To prevent33 this extinction of the Buitta, it\u2019s a necessary to accumulate reproductive data to ascertain34 seed production in captivity for conservation and choosing fish entrants of aquaculture35 from the haor.36 It is well established that reproductive performance likewise as ovary oocytes development37 in brood fish is influenced by a numerous of factors like diets, stress, egg over-ripening,38 genetics, age, water quality and environmental cues (Buchet, Coquard, Se\u2019ve\u2019re, & Barone,39 2008; Bobe & Labbe, 2010; Lanes et al."
"It is evident that rights culture needs to be restrained which reintroducing corporal punishment will ensure. Nowadays, any student will blatantly recite their rights whenever they feel it necessary in order to claim power over their teacher. Thus making the teachers within the school feel powerless to a child. If children were physically disciplined it would allow teachers to do their job at the best of their ability as they will not have the worry that the class will be disrupted by children who want the attention of their fellow classmates. One advantage of this punishment being brought back would be Backchat. As if the child isn\u2019t content with the disruption already caused but often has to cause even more of a commotion by not accepting their wrongdoings. This would hopefully come to a halt. Teachers would finally be in charge of their classes again, knowing that when they start teaching it will continue with no interruptions until the final bell."
"Agent Anderson in the Film Mississippi Burning gives a story illustrating this attitude. When he was a boy he asked his father why a black man had a mule and they did not. His father\u2019s reaction was to poison the mule so they were equal and remarked to his son \u201cIf you aint better than a nigger son, who are you better than? \u201d Agent Anderson goes on to say of his father \u201cBut he died before he realised that it was poverty that was killing him\u201d."
"Parsons (in Cree, 2000) tells us that within the family the men take on instrumental roles, and the women take on expressive roles, and that the \u2018central division of labour is central to the success of the nuclear family\u2019 (p33). Marxist perspectives do not see this view as accurate and feel that women are merely prostituting themselves for their husband\u2019s wages, and they are providing a \u2018safety valve\u2019 (p472) of emotional support for the \u2018frustration that her husband suffers at work\u2019 (p472), which keeps the husband from being angry at the working environment and ensures a good workforce (Haralambos, 1990)."
"They also suggested that previous efforts and funds had been wasted due to lack of co-ordination both locally and centrally (Batty 2002). Since its formation in 1997 the SEU has been working hard in tandem with the Government to address social exclusion and it\u2019s associated social problems. A report in December 2003 by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation showed that income poverty in Britain was on a steady downward trend and has fallen to levels similar to those at the end of the 1980\u2019s."
"Concerning the consolidated financial report and how it\u2019s prepared, 1.For instance, if a parent organization buys products or administrations from a backup, the parent organization\u2019s buy and the auxiliary\u2019s deal are both disposed of so this exchange doesn\u2019t misshape the last figures. In the combined report, the exchanges among auxiliaries or an auxiliary and a parent organization are disposed of to keep away from double calculation. Combination programming is ordinarily used to get ready merged money related reports since it isn\u2019t as straightforward as including the budgetary articulations from every backup."
"\u201d (Morrison). (Morrison, Toni. Sula. New York: Vintage International, 2004. Print. Further references to this work will be documented parenthetically in the text. In order to deal in which the poverty her family was living in, Eva detached herself emotionally from her kids. To Eva, giving up many things to insure the well being of her children shows sufficient proof of her motherly love. Eva then replies to Hannah\u2019s question by saying, \u201c \u2018You settin\u2019 here with your healthy-ass self and ax me did I love you? Them big old eyes in your head would a been two holes full of maggots if I hadn\u2019t\u2019 \u201d. However, to Hannah, providing material needs does not add up to her definition a loving mother: \u201c \u2018I didn\u2019t mean that, Mamma. I know you fed us and all."
"\u201d Moodie represents the natives as ignorant and naive, however her anger at their interest shows her close-mindedness in terms of faith. This can be seen again when Moodie writes \u201cTheir ideas of Christianity appeared to me vague and unsatisfactory. They will tell you that Christ died for men, and that He is the Saviour of the World, but they do not seem to comprehend the spiritual character of Christianity, nor the full extent of the requirements and application of the law of Christian love."
"The American Dream was first said back in 1931 by James Truslow Adams in his book \u2018Epic of America.\u2019 James Truslow Adams (1931) often repeated the following quote in his book: \u2018The American Dream is that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement.\u2019 This quote means that you don\u2019t necessarily need money in life to succeed and that you should only need your natural talents or personal skills."
"One of the advocacy issues I am acquainted with at the individual client level is advocacy for children\u2019s mental health. It has come to my attention that the needs of the children with mental health disorder have not been met by our present healthcare system. Albeit for every one out of five children in the U.S suffers from diagnosable mental health disorder, it is only 21% of the victimized children actually received the required medical diagnosis (American Academy of Pediatrics, n."
"The discussions and research about the term \u201clearning style\u201d at the higher education level are controversial and this has led to its use being elusive. Although many academics accept that it can be beneficial to the teaching/ learning process, they generally support its use in the lower levels of education such as in Primary and secondary schools."
"Adeline seems to wish to defy this tradition, as she marries after her move to America, choosing a relatively poor man who worked in a restaurant. She does not tell her parents of her marriage until afterwards, so they cannot try to stop her marrying or, as happened at her sisters wedding, have Niang take any wedding gifts she wished for. However, ironically, she ends up doing almost exactly what she set out not to do. As she says"
"A mother can also choose to keep the baby, or send him/her into foster care untill such a time as she is ready to look after the child. Foster care is perhaps the better option of the two. The mother may be unable to cope with bringing up the child from day one. Keeping the child may have a detrimental effect on both the mother and father, as well as on any other children who are involved already. Keeping the child could mean that the family could run into financial difficulty and also could not devote the time needed to raise the child."
"If it were not for the prejudices held against Lennie, he might have had a chance to survive. He might have been able to defend himself to the law enforcement in Weed. He might have also been given leeway for his treatment of Curley\u2019s wife if he could have explained himself, but George knew that if Curley caught Lennie, then either he would kill or institutionalize him. George performed a great mercy on Lennie by killing him. He allowed Lennie the brief moment to live his dream and take care of his rabbits before he removed him from the world that would deny him and force a worse fate upon him."
"When you live in world full of hate and oppression it\u2019s hard to find yourself, now imagine being a black male trying to find yourself in a world with white supremacy and hate within your own race. In his novel, Invisible Man, Ralph Ellison\u2019s narrator is continuously being accosted with finding his identity in his world."
"In order to maintain the colonial thrust, European colonizers were prompted to create ideologies that support the dominance that European countries had gained in their respective colonies. Religious, social, and scientific ideas that were spawned during that time gave rise to the Eurocentric ideas that are extant even in modernity. According to Blaut, \u201cA [Christian] missionary might have great love and respect for the people among whom he or she worked, but could not be expected to believe that the culture and mind of these non-Christians was on par with that of Christian Europeans\u201d (24)."
"For others, as body temperatures dropped, hallucinations began and the body felt as if it were on fire. The urge to sleep was strong. For some, that was the end. For others, an indomitable spirit forced them onward. For those who stopped, core temperatures continued to drop. Heartbeats slowed to half the normal rate; the muscle was less able to respond to normal electrical signals to beat steadily. The heart fibrillated. They ceased to beat. Circulation stopped. Brain activity ended. Others were victims of extreme frostbite: the \u201cirreversible freezing of living tissue. (213) Blood retreats from extremities to the center of the body to keep the heart and lungs functioning. When skin temperature reaches between 22 and 24 degrees, moisture within tissue freezes. Ice crystals form within the layers, freezing adjacent tissues in an unending pattern. The freezing spreads to muscles and tendons, irreversibly killing those tissues. The victim at this point feels nothing as all sensation is gone. For those who miraculously survived the ravages of the storm, the effects of prolonged cold and the resultant hypothermia continued."
"My family was able to establish themselves financially because of social welfare programs such as war bonds, Pell grants, and the integration of schools. My grandfather was able to own their own home and provide for our family. He had a career as a school administrator they paid well. He provided opportunities for his children to attend college and for his wife. Desmond and Emirbayer argue that , \u201cIf we hope to drive racial domination from the gates of our schools we must continue the work of confronting whiteness in the curriculum\u201d (346)."
"Although later the reader learns that not long after getting her own Manchurian servant that nurse Ueda soon admits that she too \u201csoon got into the habit of hitting her, for no reason at all\u201d. (Endo 1992, p. 87). This again shows how effective Endo is in portraying racial issues by showing the tensions between the Japanese and other Asians. A subtle representation of racism within Hick\u2019s film can be seen through his use of flashbacks. During these, the audience becomes aware that Ishmael and Hatsue were childhood friends as we see them enjoying many hours of fun together whilst growing up."
"A good friend will act the way your sibling does. You jumped over the fence, broke the windows, covered up for each other, and got grounded together. Both of you will stay in one room and keep quiet while trying to hold your tears from bursting when your parents were fighting. Those memories of what you had been through together are priceless. Nonetheless, there are also days when your big brother or sister brought back their date, you are happy for them but suddenly you became invisible. You tried to distract them and grabbed their attention back but it ended up in a nasty fight."
"As a result of this case states could impose legal punishments on people consorting with members of another race. The most common examples of Jim Crow laws were forbidding intermarriage and ordering business owners and public institutions (schools, offices) to keep their black and white clientele separate. Basically, the discrimination of black Americans was now legal. The only justice that didn? t agree with the court? s decision, John Harlan, summarised it well stating \u201cthe present decision\u2026 ill not only stimulate aggressions, more or less brutal and irritating, upon the admitted rights of coloured citizens, but will encourage the belief that it is possible, by means of state enactments, to defeat the beneficial purposes which the people of the United States had in view when they adopted the recent (13th and 14th) amendments of the Constitution. \u201d In addition, even though black people possessed the right to vote, by the year 1902 there was only 3,000 black voters in Alabama as it was one of the states that created impossible qualification tests for black voters."
"It just goes to say that as we grow and experience things around us in our environment we tend to conform to the ways of society to form our personality and attitudes. The more we educate our young people and be good role models maybe then and only then can we prevent a situation like American History X form happening. A perfect example of conformity is in the scene which we see the skinheads bonding. They are led by Derek\u2019s brilliant speechmaking and\u00a0fueled by drugs, beer, tattoos, and heavy metal and need all insecure people feel to belong to a movement greater then themselves. Together they feel that in their world all races stick together and are at undeclared war with all others"
"Fewer Lawsuits: One of main causes of concern in upper management is lawsuits filed by employees for discrimination, sexual harassment and wrongful dismissal. Diversity training helps all employees in a company to know what the laws are and what the company policies are. With training, people learn what acceptable behaviour is when dealing with a subordinate, peer or someone you feel is different from you in a way such as race, religion, nationality or physical abilities. In many cases, a situation is interpreted differently by the people involved, leading to misunderstandings and charges of wrongdoing. Once the employees have clear guidelines on how they should behave towards one another in the workplace, there are few misunderstandings and, subsequently, fewer lawsuits. Diversity training reinforces the policies that are already in place to protect employees and the company."
"(Renzetti, 1996; Roberts, 2002; Brown, 2008) Similar facts on domestic violence apply to both heterosexual and homosexual couples. Even partnership of the same sex does not necessarily provide a guarantee of equal status of the partners forming the relationship. It is also difficult for a victim of domestic violence in a heterosexual and homosexual relationship to leave the partnership. Blame on the victim in both types of partnership also occurs to influence the decision to report the incident."
"Further evidence indicates the relationship between adolescent parenting and accidental death of children. In a study using linked birth and death records from North Carolina and Washington State for 1968 through 1980. Wicklund et al. (1984) found a strong inverse relationship between maternal age and mortality rates from accidents for children under one, net of parity and educational level of mother (a proxy for SES). In the article, \u201cThe children of teen childbearers\u201d, Hofferth states, \u201cThe actual mortality rate from accidents during the first year of life is actually quite low\u2014in 1980 in North Carolina about 3 out of 10,000 live births died from accidents in the first year in Washington state the rate was 1.47 per 10,000 live births\u201d. They differ in race, age of the mother, and level of education."
"In this case, we found out that neither the Pasyon was modified from the Book of the Bible and was from Spanish nor from Roman origin thus it was a customization of the story of Jesus Christ in the New Testament. However, in terms of the alteration of the meaning, though the text was converted and modified, we have observed that the sense that the reading wants to impart are still the same since both the Bible and The Pasyon contains the story and the life of Jesus Christ, though the latter is in poetic form. For Social Hierarchy It was said that the power dynamic that makes racial difference historically has been tied to colonialism. Some, incorporated fairly fully, forcing their national language (or atleast its writing system) (Paul Spickard, Race and Nation, 2005). In, Leslie E."
"Due to racism, he is forced to hate his wife whom he associated with the beginning of racism. Shakespeare was able to bring out the concept earlier than it happened and did so using a tragedy which ends catastrophically. Characters in the play, in their natural behavior, brought out the different perspectives that the society held for blacks, despite their commitment to their societies. It is unfortunate that the same happens today."
"The observer can then write it down in a diary, event recording or just add it into the child\u2019s or young person\u2019s records. Time Sampling. Time sampling allows you to look at what a child does over a period of times, such as morning or part of an afternoon. This means that you gain a more complete picture of the child. This type of observation needs some planning, as the observer needs to keep an eye on the children. A sheet is prepared with the times marked out. At the each of the times on the sheet, the observer watches what the child is doing."
"A supportive environment is one where there is an opportunity to learn and develop which is safe and secure. The child learns how to self-regulate and practice their social skills through reciprocity and social interactions. Early caregiver relationships with a young child up to 3 years are the most salient when the child\u2019s brain plasticity is at its strongest for brain function and behaviour. It is here the child develops their motor, cognition, language and visual systems (Osher, Cantor, Berg, Steyer, & Rose, 2018)."
"But with each passing year, the little comments and remarks literally ate away at my identity. Comments like \u201cYou did good, but Amanda got a better grade\u201d can easily destroy a child\u2018s self-esteem. As I became older, I started believing that I was not growing up as myself, but rather as the product of someone else. It almost made me happy to see older teachers leave and others take their place. Unfortunately, school made up only half of the problem. The other half occurred in the one place where it really should not but often did: at home."
"In some circumstances the only method to find our true self is to go against the boundaries applied to use by others. Overemphasis on adapting ourselves to satisfy what others think and desire can cause individuals to turn into such parochial beings that we lose sight of reality and who we really are. Knowing who we are and where we belong is fundamental and it allows us to live as happy and confident individuals able to reject conformity. We are all part of a family, a community and a culture. While we think of ourselves as being individuals, we must also accept that as social creatures we like to feel like we belong and feel safe. This, in turn, gives us the confidence to be \u201dme\u201d. The clothes we wear, the music we listen to, the\u00a0football team we belong to, even the school we attend forms the parcel of who we are."
"In A Reputable Female Mrs Baroda follows the exact same course as Mildred in the beginning her interest in a guy by feeling \u201cstimulated\u201d at his absence of interest in her. The simple truth of the physical existence of the guy is once again what awakens the female\u2019s sexual interest as Gouvernail\u2019s silences and indifference seem barely developed to attract her. Again like Mildred Mrs Baroda is puzzled by the distinction beetweeen the social role she expects her guers to play and Gouvernail\u2019s reality."
"Resiliency can be defined as the ability to recover from adversity stronger and more resourceful (Walsh, 2006). Resiliency is the common theme throughout this family as they have endured the father\u2019s suicide, the mother\u2019s depression, morbid obesity, and subsequent death, the loss of their \u201cold\u201d mother, the disconnection of family members, and Arnie\u2019s disability. Although there is dysfunction in this family, they work hard to sustain what they have. There is a strong bond and commitment to take care of one another."
"On June 30, 2018 the \u2018Families Belong Together\u2019 march and rally was held in Washington D.C. About more than 30,000 protesters marched to protest against president, Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies. Donald Trumps, \u201czero tolerance policy\u201d is a policy that has separated many children from their families. During the first couple days of Donald Trump\u2019s \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy, nearly almost 500 children were taken away and separated from their families. This occurred during the summer of 2018. These kids that were taken away and were put under custody in government detention centers. These kids were put in cages like as if these kids were being portrayed as harmful criminals. Some of the children that were taken away were under the age of five. They had no clue what was going on and just wanted to be reunited with their families. These kids were in the centers for days, weeks, and even months. The parents of the children had to make a decision on whether to have their kid sent back with them or let them stay in the United States to pursue their dreams without their families beside them. Many protests and marches were being held all across the United States due to Trump\u2019s \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy. Leah Cayasso is a 12-year old girl who spoke in the rally in front of thousands of people. Leah Cayasso was one in multiple children who are in constant fear of losing their mother or father and in some cases, even both. Cayasso said in her speech:"
"6 Creating a strong foundation for the economy of Canada improved many things. It protected the country if anything bad were to happen and made it easier to repair the country back to normal. A countries look, or reputation also depends on its economy. When a country has prosperity, people from other countries will want to visit, earning more money from foreigners as well. \u201cThe Auto Pact helped strengthen the relationship between Canada and the US.\u201d"
"Both the psychologist and the interviewer- investigator who interviewed him prior to his entry to the force raised red flags about his suitability with issues raised by the psychologist including his \u201d tendency to exaggerate to the point of deception\u201d, as well as \u201d his difficulty in evaluating situations and acting appropriately\u201d ( O\u2019 Hara , 2012, p.115). Skills which were surely inherent basic ones for a police officer who is expected to deal with volatile and dangerous situations as part of his basic duties. He had also been the subject of a rape allegation fifteen years prior to his application to join the Washington Police Department which although purged was considered by the investigators as \u201ccredible\u201d (O\u2019 Hara, 2012, p.116). So far not a great start for the police department but its continued failures must be considered intrinsic in the culmination of David Brame shooting his wife and taking his own life. Whilst the organization may have not pulled the trigger it is this authors opinion that its failures enabled the downward spiral of its officer."
"Separate Pasts takes place during the 1950\u2019s in Melton A. McLaurin\u2019s small hometown, Wade, North Carolina. It is a detailed story of his boyhood in the rural South, which was a time when racism was a daily norm. McLaurin argues that racism existed unchallenged in the rural South. I found that this argument is valid due to the personal experiences that he had to face while growing up in the rural South, which he describes in great detail. McLaurin grew up with the knowledge that whites were treated very differently than blacks and not thinking anything of it."
"Parents are there to guide their child every step of the way until they cannot anymore. There are benefits to both ends, with childhood there is no worry about the future because children have their parents to back them up. As an adult, they can make a decision and not have to worry about what anyone else says. With that, there are unfavorable factors to both sides. As a child, if one wants to make a decision it goes through parents which could lead to frustration with each other and losing the little independence they felt they had. As an adult, a decision can be hard because there are few people that one can ask opinions from, and the decision could lead to serious consequences."
"They\u2019re land had been taken over by European colonists. and subsequently on they faced more subjugation when efforts to absorb Autochthonal people into white society were made. For over a century. Australia\u2019s natives have been faced with many racialist biass and several terrible instances of subjugation. Issues amongst the autochthonal people began in the late 1700\u2019s. shortly after the reaching of European colonists."
"If that bastard bus driver\u2026. he says. \u2018Jes\u2019 a little stretch. \u2018 God damn near four miles, that\u2019s what it was\u201d. Even though this is also verbal violence using foul language and blasphemy, the reader can feel the tension bubbling up inside this character, and that what makes this an electrifying story."
"During my third year at the company I was working for my fianc? at the time found a better job it was in Connecticut and I found out I was pregnant for my third child that we had planned for, we spoke and decided what to do for a better tomorrow."
"Ever since I was eight or nine, I went to the office associated with the office of the God\u2019s Wife of Amen. I hoped to become the King\u2019s Great Wife and God\u2019s Wife, which were the two most powerful titles an Egyptian female could hold. Once I became the God\u2019s Wife, I had many responsibilities such as doing rituals, maintaining the God\u2019s House, and bringing communication to Thutmose I with Amen of Karnak."
"Just like in primary socialization, secondary socialization can also be informal, by gradually attuning himself to the subtleties of meanings and actions in the new situation. The way in which recruits to occupations in medicine, the law, the army, sociology, or the administrative grades of the civil service are socialized so that they come to think, act as, and indeed \u201care\u201d doctors, barristers, officers, sociologists or permanent secretaries, is a special form of secondary socialization termed professionalization."
"For example, some couples enjoy laying in bed and having intimate conversations or maybe they just talk about what happened to them that day. Although they are not having sexual relations, they are still forming that intimate feeling that sex can give them. The article further goes on to describe other ways couples can show their affection for each other aside from having sex. These include, but are not limited to, having intimate conversations, writing a lover a card, letter, and/or love note, supporting a partner in his/her extracurricular activities, and lastly, going out on creative and fun dates (Abstinence). Furthermore, others argue that they use sexual relations in their relationship(s) as they feel it is the only way to make their lover or partner stay with them. However, if a man makes a woman feel like this or vice-versa, they should simply think about leaving said partner and finding a better one that is not going to attempt to pressure them into something they do not want to do or something they are simply not ready for."
"Joseph, C. (2011). Dems Spoiling for Planned Parenthood Fight. National Journal. Cameron Joseph is a young political journalist. He is currently working in Washington D.C writing about the re-election of Obama. The article listed above is about the republicans \u201cdefunding\u201d Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood is an organization that provides birth control and also performs abortions. Indiana officials say that taking funding for Medicaid to fund Planned Parenthood is illegal. \u201cTo prevent pregnancy or abortions, why don\u2019t we fund organizations that provide birth control to prevent abortions?\u201d"
"This writing style made it easier to read and enjoyable as well, especially for me as I tend to stray away from nonfiction and/or commentary styles of books. I also enjoyed how Ham and Ware in Chapter Three distinguish the differences between Darwinian natural selection and a scientific and Christian view of natural selection. On page 76 of chapter three Ham states, \u201cNatural selection is not an onward-upward process with new information added\u2026natural selection cannot create totally new information already in the particular gene pool\u2026[it] results in a loss of genetic information and/or redistribution of pre-existing information."
"Standardized testing is tests that are uniform, and the scores from them are used to compare states, schools, and individuals. A lot of people think it is a good thing, but in reality it does more harm than good. There are many reasons standardized testing does more harm than good, such as, it robs children of their childhoods, and it teaches children to be good at tests but doesn\u2019t prepare them for adult lives. Standardized testing begins in third grade by the No Child Left Behind acts mandate, but most schools start testing students earlier to try to get children good at taking tests so they will do better in the future."
"Most sociologists agree that the nuclear family first became popular in the United Kingdom in the 1950 \u2013 1960\u2019s after World War 2, although it existed from approximately the 18th Century. It originally occurred in upper-class families that could afford to live in this way and then eventually filtered down to the middle-classes and finally became popular amongst most classes in the twentieth century. The nuclear Family \u2018(consisting of husband and wife with dependent children) this was idealized and promoted in the 1950\u2019s with the husband going out to work and the wife taking care of the house and family matters."
"Thus, even after being an American citizen legally, immigrants face lack of opportunities and the respect from the community.Who deserves to be granted a U.S. citizenship? It is a question that former President Obama, current President Trump and the Congress are trying to answer. It\u2019s an issue that the United States is grappling with since the country\u2019s earliest days. The founding fathers of the constitution states \u201cPeople who immigrated and spent years building lives in this country deserved citizenship\u201d (Cohen). Today\u2019s complex visa system and length wait times, which sometimes extends from 10 to 20 years, stray from these roots. For those who can outlast the lengthy wait for legal status and citizenship, another hurdle exists: processing visas, the cost of sponsorship, and any fines potentially levied on aspiring citizens. During the 18th century, there were no illegal immigrants in the United States. Experts believe, \u201cFor the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the United States illegally, a pathway to legal residency can be hard to come by\u201d (Tiernan). The supreme court, in the past, have heard many hearings on whether the illegal immigrants be granted citizenship. In the eighteenth century, the United States faced a far more noxious threat than those who crossed a border without inspection. They were the British Loyalists, who had take up arms and ammunition to raise their voice against the American revolutionaries. Their actions were unforgivable, but they still sought citizenship, and made up approximately 20 percent of the population."
"The same is true for juvenile offenders. Some juveniles that are convicted of violent crimes are locked away in prison until such time as they are old enough to be executed, which really does not teach juveniles anything valuable about the death penalty or avoidance of violent crime. More often than not, these juveniles are not executed, and most juveniles know that they will not receive the death penalty, even if they are tried as adults, so they are not deterred by the possibility (Radelet & Akers, 1996)."
"In fact some seats of a certain French civil war have already broken out with the rioting in the French capital and a number of cities all over France. \u201cBands of youths in cawls start by setting fire to parked cars, break shop windows with baseball bats, wreck public telephones and ransack cinemas, libraries and schools. When the police arrive on the scene, the rioters attack them with stones, knives and baseball bats. The police respond by firing tear-gas grenades and blank shots in the air. Sometimes the youths fire back with real bullets. This scene resembles to one of those in Western films rather than to the reality that happened in November 2005 in one of the underpriviledged suburbs of Paris, Clichy-sous-Bois. The question that immediately emerges is: What did go wrong in the French integration system? Did not it promise to assimilate all immigrants smoothly into the French society and provide them with the same standard of living as it does for the original Frenchmen? The response is to be found right in the \u201cepicenters\u201c of the riots, the French suburbs."
"It criminalized black people as a whole, a process that, destroyed untold lives but also successfully transferred the guilt for slavery from the people who prolonged it to the people who suffered through it. African Americans were looked as criminals. They were given names without having a choice. They were given labels because of their skin color. In the documentary, Ms. Alexander argues that mass imprisonment exists with slavery and Jim Crow. Under the Jim Crow laws, the state laws had different laws for blacks and whites, segregated them under the rule of separate but equal."
"This is also suggested through the possibility of the son, also living a distance away from his father. This may be inclined through the use of \u2018Lifesaver\u2019 sweets, being bought as a present in JFK airport (USA) when meeting his Dad: \u201cLifesavers\u2026. Only bought rushing through JFK as a last resort\u201d. In term of the latter poem, this seems to show how after two years passing since the narrators mothers death, the father is still in denial, however he later dies, leaving the narrator alone to grieve over him."
"High stakes testing such as NAPLAN can also create conflicts between what is best for the students and what is best for the school. This may exacerbate the unwillingness of school hierarchy to deviate from traditional core curriculum/structures, as overall results can often be linked with a school\u2019s reputation as well as government funding. (Tomlinson et al. 2003)"
"Surprisingly, Horner, the stock character of a rake, offers a contrasting and less superficial opinion of women; perhaps proposing that women in a married relationship offer more than just sex and wealth (central motifs in the comedy). Valuing intellect and personality in a woman, he states \u201cme thinks wit is more necessary than beauty, and I think no young woman ugly that has it, and no handsome woman agreeable without it\u201d, his speech providing a more encouraging exemplar of a man\u2019s authenticity in love. Nevertheless, the play opens amid an informal conversation regarding the spread of a rumour of \u201cdamned malady\u201d, devised only so the protagonist, Horner, can sleep with other men\u2019s wives. It is here when the writer begins to censure the corruption of matrimony in Restoration society, and despite Horner offering some positive views of women, it is this rumour that totally encapsulates the entire play, and thus discloses Wycherley\u2019s attack against the sadly typical marriages of the Restoration period."
"First of all for the person who has the baby with them has to take care of it and it is a really big hassle for them. This causes them to be stressed and very hectic the whole time on the airplane. For the people who are on the plane, they have to listen to the loud and annoying cry of a baby. This is something that one doesn\u2019t want to go thru when they are on the airplane for three hours. All in all these are my improvements of an airplane and how I think it will make it better for the people traveling in it. Got Planes?"
"In King\u2019s last reference to Socrates, the rationalist tallies up chronicled figures who were associated with civil disobedience (King 2). As well as from philosophers and theologians, King frequently seeks inspiration from Biblical sources. Another Allusion is the mention of St. Thomas Aquinas and his view on unjust laws being not humanly natural or uplifting. This relates to the degrading of human personality. When it comes to segregation an inferior minority is shunned upon (Hornsby 4). Biblical allusions of Apostle Paul carry the gospel of freedom. King addresses racism by preaching for non-violence. He refers to a common ground of Biblical texts to connect to his audience of clergymen, to get his point of a peaceful resolution across, and encourage a consideration of ethics. He additionally recognizes the earnestness and status of the clergymen who composed the letter he\u2019s reacting to, regarding their validity as men of good will who are knowledgeable on Bible lessons (King 3)."
"Music has been a big part of the Civil War and the composers and musicians have impacted the war and the type of feeling the soldiers have when they are fighting or marching to the music. Music caused great ease to the soldiers when learning to march, or just to feel good about themselves. Music was used for many things including, music telling the soldiers when to get up, music telling them when to go to bed, when to get breakfast, when to eat dinner, when to clean streets, when to drill, when to stop drilling, when to go to church on Sabbath, and when to come back. The musicians would wrote songs about war and they would make these songs to express how they feel about the dangerous and stressful situations that are happening in their life. Music was very popular in the early 1860s and was used for many things. Music was everywhere and was almost always playing or being played by many people. The civil war was a very tragic thing that happened, but was enlightened at the time through music. The soldiers would relieve their stress by music being played. Music was also a way of Americans being kept on time throughout their day. Music changed history as we know today by showing us that even in those dark war and battle times, people were keeping peace with themselves through music and creativity with music."
"The second alert is lack of focus. When people don\u2019t fulfill their necessity, the thoughts and emotion will deceive them. They can\u2019t sit calmly, they are too easy to divert the attention and postpone all works, and they will have the difficulty in concentrating. Because of that problem, they will find many inabilities. People need to make sure that they get refreshment and renewal if they want to get their focus back and sabotage themselves indirectly. The next alert is grumbling. Grumbling or complaining is a way to communicate to themselves about the unhappiness in their life. Grumbling means that actually people need help, support or break and they will feel many regrets. Therefore, if people realize that they are grumbling, they need to ask themselves why they grumble, what the causes of the unhappiness are. The last alert is physical and emotional symptoms."
"Racial and cultural diversity within non-native English-speaking communities People belonging to different linguistic backgrounds face a number of issues in their daily lives. For the fact that culture and language are entwined, language minority individuals are anticipated to use and learn the novel cultural dispositions and the novel language in an effective and efficient manner. This novel culture and language is diverse from what they have learned at home. Despite that the United States is amongst the most diversified nations of the world, there are some languages which are widely employed like Spanish and English."
"Media communication on immigration and multiculturalism is severely censored, the media presenting what they want you to know and think. Be your own judge and do not rely on the flawed views of journalists whose job opportunities rely on editors and media owners who are part of the pro-immigration lobby."
"The culmination of the whole work is tied to Lennie\u2019s love for everything soft and pleasant to touch. He wanted to touch the dress of the girl, stroked the mice and newborn puppies, and also stroked the silky hair of Curley\u2019s wife, and at her own request, but due to her mental inferiority, he was not aware of all his actions. The woman, frightened by how much Lennie\u2019s excessive attention is paid to her hair, tries to escape, but in the strong hands of the mighty, she is a helpless puppy, whom Lennie literally \u201cfell in love with\u201d to death. All he has now is to seek escape again."
"Steinbeck gives careful detail of Crooks\u2019 room. At the beginning of chapter 4, page 66 reads \u201ca long box filled with straw, on which his blankets were flung.\u201d Crooks\u2019 bunk is described as an untidy and uncomfortable place to rest, much similar to the animal\u2019s with whom he shares the harness room with."
"Disney is a large enough company where only one person\u2019s opinion towards them isn\u2019t going to change anything. But Giroux is not alone in his argument. Other scholars, such as Robert Gooding-Williams joins Giroux in describing how Disney uses stereotypes to portray a message to the audience. In \u201cSnow Whitey, Stereotyping in the Magic Kingdom,\u201d Gail Robertson discusses the different ideas of stereotyping Disney portrays in their films. For example, in The Lion King, \u201cMufasa, the proud lion ruler, and his son Simba are key characters while mom is relegated to a supporting role\u201d (43). In Disney, the males are always superior to the women. Even in a charming animated film about lions, Disney finds a way to reinforce gender stereotypes."
"\u2013 approximately 5 billion animals are consumed as food annually \u2013 compared to that, only 17-22 million animals are used for in research annually \u2013 anesthesia is used today to numb the body during operations because it was successfully tested on animals => 6 % of animals do however experience pain, but this has to do with the research itself \u2013 the alleviation of pain would compromise the results => 61 % of animals used suffer no pain"
"The Government would argue, and usually do, that when it comes to childrens\u2019 education and care it does its best according to the funds available to it. But the figures don\u2019t necessarily add up. According to a study by German Bertelsmann Stiftung philanthropic group reported in the Irish Times on the 6 November 2017 (Smith, 2017) Ireland spends just 0.1 per cent of GDP on pre-primary education, the least of all in the EU. This is a damning indictment of a government that produces policy document after policy document on child care, education and rights. But, in 2004, when the play policy was published the Government\u2019s document was a step in the right direction. They just neglected to finance it. This is all the more surprising considering that in the body of the document they acknowledge that Ireland lagged behind other European countries like Belgium, the Netherlands, UK and Sweden in prioritising play."
"The two characters became friends and have started to experience change that could not have been possible without each other. Wallace became a personality in the school because of his natural talent in basketball and more importantly, his unexplainable gift in writing. And because the gift cannot be explained, a certain professor, Crawford, somehow was challenged. Crawford and Wallace had a conflict when Wallace tried to stand up and protect his classmate from the intimidating Crawford."
"\u201d, this text shows that Shaffer was a tough and sturdy and wouldn\u2019t give up for any reason. \u201cOn the other hand, even the dustiest little hamlets nearly always have a store of caf\u00e9, unlike now, and generally when he left the trail he could count on a country bus to flag down for a lift to the nearest town\u201d. The reader is also told that he might have been helped along the way, so suspicion arises."
"Another sub-technique that the author employs to gain effective content is writing style. Although this is an article about parenting education published on The Wall Street Journal, which is newspaper about business, Amy Chua puts into use simple words instead of fancy words in the entire article. This is a very good way to get close to the audience who I believe are parents and teenagers since they are the people who care most about the development of new generation through effective educational methods. Throughout the article, the author uses many quotes as well as conversations on the purpose of making her piece livelier."
"The identity theorist\u2019s Erik Erikson and James Marcia were important contributors to the mental analysis of an individual\u2019s character and social advancement. Erik Erikson is most notoriously known for his theories on the teen search for identity and his concepts regarding a person\u2019s self-discovery. James Marcia broadened further on Erikson\u2019s principles through his proposal of the four identity statuses, which include moratorium, foreclosure, diffusion, and accomplishment, as well as the 4 human crises\u2019. As psychology is becoming a growing number of established in our contemporary society, it has actually ended up being more socially appropriate to slam or expose the concerns psychology involves, particularly human identity, which typically times can be the most controversial subject."
"Aspects supporting the thought of \u2018social ability\u2019 specifically how Latinos contrast both between socially and intra-socially and that there is a need to genuinely decipher this conduct in connection to health looking for conduct and meds adherence Insights into how drugs were utilized when abroad, the understanding that \u2018generics\u2019 were \u2018second rate\u2019 prescriptions, the effect of \u2018stretch\u2019, how meds were \u2018shared\u2019 and how drugs squander was seen given some charming bits of knowledge to meds adherence Professionalism in the two drug specialists and GPs is esteemed by Latino populace, yet between expert coordinated effort and correspondence should be improved for this populace to have more \u2018trust\u2019 in services The significance of improving the drug specialist quiet relationship is outlined and there is an open door for community pharmacy to connect better with Latino services clients in arrange upgrade their picture, information, aptitudes and mentality in connection to this The members showed their convictions of including communities and religious pioneers in health training and community health activities, and invited pharmacy contribution to this Health advancement exercises in a community setting were invited. The utilization of interpreted flyers (and for sure handouts as a rule) was negligible Sensitive correspondence with Latinos uncovered how \u2018derided\u2019 conditions, for example, dejection and contraception were seen by this community, and how having these conditions affect the individual and their \u2018acknowledgment\u2019 in their more extensive community. Implications for Workers in this Field: Community pharmacy service are being reconfigured to center around specific areas of intrigue, for example, medications adherence and general health activities, the discoveries delineate why it is critical for community drug specialists to be better educated of how their services clients decipher their possess health in connection to their social, mental and restorative conditions."
"In Barbara Smiths Towards a Black Feminist Criticism. She writes about the lack of acknowledgement towards black female feminist writers and black lesbian writers by everyone in the writing community, the white feminist community, and even the black community. I find it interesting how the white feminist community want equality however they don\u2019t even support their fellow black feminist writers. How are we all going to be equal if you can\u2019t even support writers from a different race. She writes about Sara Blackburn, a feminist critic and her responds to Toni Morrison\u2019s book Sula. Sara Blackburn had this to say about Toni Morrison\u2019s Sula: \u201cToni Morrison is far too talented to remain only a marvelous recorder of the black side of provincial american life. If she is to maintain the large and serious audience she deserves, she is going to have to address a riskier contemporary reality that this beautiful but nevertheless distanced novel."
"The lines of resistance protect the basic structure and become activated when the normal line of defence is penetrated by environmental stressors. If sufficient energy is 9 * available, the normal line of defence is restored; but if the lines of resistance are not effective, death may follow. Reconstitution involves stabilisation of the system and movement backwards to the normal line of defence. Health care intervention takes place in the prevention modalities, that is the primary, secondary and tertiary levels of prevention. (Clark (2008:67)) Prescribed reading Study Neuman\u2019s model in Clark (2008, or later editions)."
"For example in A Man Called Ove, throughout the first chapters Ove is frequently talking to his dead wife. Ove is a lonely man living by himself, and only 6 months ago his wife passed away and this has made him very depressed. Without the support he needs at the beginning of the book, he prepares to kill himself to be with her. \u201c [He] climbs up on the stool, and puts his head in the noose."
"The earth\u2019s average temperature has increased about 2 degrees Fahrenheit during the 20th century. What\u2019s the big deal? Two degrees may sound like a small amount, but it\u2019s an unusual event in our planet\u2019s recent history. Earth\u2019s climate record, preserved in tree rings, ice cores, and coral reefs, shows that the global average temperature is stable over long periods of time."
"\u2018Letting my mind run haphazardly.\u2019 The personification here is for the mind giving the mind human traits. The trait is running haphazardly, which is unplanned, random, or aimlessly. So Simon means that his mind went crazy, or as with the personification, his mind ran randomly aimlessly. Alliteration too, was there in the text. \u2018With water glistening\u2019. Anyone who knows what alliteration is would definitely notice this sentence as presented here. Hyperbole is another figurative language which was presented more than once in the text. I will only refer to two only."
"Often times, the breast milk was not enough, or infected due to mothers being sick as described in the book. The only alternative mothers could do was substitute breast milk with a sip of sweetened condensed milk. This substitution would make the babies stop crying. My mother told me that my brothers were mostly fed with sweetened condensed milk because she was incapable to produce enough breast milk for the hungry boys. Kao Kalia explained in the book that during their mission to cross the Mekong River her older sister, Dawb was given sweetened condensed milk because of her ill other who was unable to produce breast milk. As many Hmong can contest, the Mekong River is a treacherous river. When my parents, my siblings and my grandparent decided to cross the risky Mekong River, they too used pieces of long bamboo to float across from Laos to Thailand as described in the book. My mother described to me that the part they crossed on the Mekong River was roughly one mile long, which was longer than Kao Kalia\u2019s family experienced. The Mekong River was monstrous and was not forgiving at all for those that try to cross its body of water."
"The first method involves allowing children to select among various toys and activities. Parents, teachers, and guardians should encourage kids to select various activities and toys based on their interests rather than gender appropriateness. This choice provides kids with a broader array of experiences while combating gender stereotypes. For example, when female children are allowed to play with car toys, it may inspire them to like cars and become engineers and drivers rather than leaving these roles for males only."
"Regardless of her childhood without a mother, his most youthful little girl, Cordelia, has grown up to be a fair and adoring lady. The other two little girls, then again, have grown up to cheat and eager for power. Maybe with a mother in the image, the two more seasoned girls would have turned out in an unexpected way. Coppelia Khan notes, \u201cboth genders start to build up a feeling of self in connection to a mother-lady. However, a young lady\u2019s feeling of femaleness emerges through her childish association with the mother. Since a mother was not there to demonstrate to her girls generally accepted methods to act and carry on like ladies, they had minimal decision however to emulate men\u2019s example."
"Mark Twain is an inspirational writer with amazing talent and has written some remarkable classics. However, the excerpt from Roughing It When the Buffalo Climbed a Tree, will not be joining my list of his beloved masterpieces. Instead I found this fictional account tedious to read and found myself drifting off to sleep while at the same time trying to\u00a0understand the particular vernacular used in this piece. The narrator of the majority of this tale was a character named Bemis whose style of speech was rambling and over-the-top. For example, \u201cWell, I was first out on his neck \u2013 the horse\u2019s, not the bull\u2019s\u2014and then underneath, and next on his rump, and sometimes head up, and sometimes heels\u2014but I tell you it seemed solemn and awful to be ripping and tearing and carrying on so in the presence of death, as you might say.\u201d (Twain 16)"
"White audiences in the southern part of the States were ruthless towards black people and their music. The north appeared to be more tolerant, but there were still many confrontations between blacks and whites. Jazz was a part of modernism which helped pave the way for liberals who felt pinned down by the older conservative generations. It also served as a medium for white musicians searching to liberate themselves from the conservative constraints of their time. One can see that the northern part of the states, where cities were mostly located, accepted jazz more easily and quicker."
"Everyone has a right to live no matter how severe their crime was. He also said that lying is always wrong. If they take the same steps to use the death penalty on a criminal as they would with lying, then that would mean that as punishment, we would have to lie to the person who lied to us in the beginning. With this reason Kant contradicts himself because if we should live our life by the Golden Rule, then the killing will never end because you (government) would seem to expect that someone should kill you too."
"Although homosexuality causes a lot of people to struggle with their identity, the damage caused by racism due to diverse skin colours is worse. As a result of historical factors, coloured races are often ignorantly considered inferior to Caucasian people, especially those with white skin throughout the world. Examples such as the 2005 Cronulla riots in Australia, a racial conflict involving Middle East Appearance, show that until today, people with coloured skins are still targets of racism due to bigotry and conservatism."
"This example mainly describes one form of racism in America today, but there are many forms of racism today found globally. I also believe that the labeling theory is related to racism. The labeling theory simply says that if you label someone as defiant it will increase the chances of them being defiant because that is how they see themselves. Again this is a stretch of a relation but someone being racist can be doing it for attention. It does not matter if the attention is good or bad but attention is attention."
"As well as callous Carlson is insensitive and we are shown this in the final chapter after George has killed Lennie Carlson shows no sympathy. \u2018An\u2019 you got it away from him and you took it an\u2019 you killed him? \u2018 In \u2018Of Mice and Men\u2019 all the characters are lonely in one way or another and this loneliness is brought about by other factors, mainly the time and place in which the novel is set. Other ways in which loneliness is brought to some characters is because of racism and sexism, although these two factors are brought about by the time and place in which the novel is set and the culture in which it is set in."
"Gore uses ethos to give him credibility during his speeches, so that the audience respects him and the concepts he is trying to explain. Even the way Gore is dressed and the way he presents himself gives him integrity and authority. He is dressed in a very presidential looking suit and presents himself graciously and proudly."
"The lines \u201cAt first I visited\u201d, portray Mrs Midas initial efforts to make things work (an action that is more commonly associated with men), however Duffy then presents Mrs Midas\u2019 resolve as diminished through her description of Midas as \u201cthin\u201d and \u201cdelirious\u201d. These words clearly present Midas as something similar to a wild, stray animal that has lost what little sanity it had previously, and it is through this description that the reader is shown the hopelessness of the situation."
"In 1956 Mandela and 150 others were arrested and charged with treason for their political advocacy, these beliefs encouraged Mandela to direct a peaceful campaign free of violence as an act of defiance against the South African government. While Nelson Mandela was confined for 27 years in prison, he developed tuberculosis and the color of his skin granted him the lowest level of treatment of hospitality from prison workers. On February 11, 1990 Frederik Willem de Klerk authorized Nelson Mandela\u2019s release from solitary confinement. Frederik also unbanned he ANC, a liberation movement formed in 1912 to unite the African people, and removed restrictions on political groups and suspended executions. Upon his release the changes he had on slavery and the world were evident. Nelson Mandela showed people that a single person could be a catalyst and he wasn\u2019t afraid to be that one person. As Mandela worded it \u201cThere is no passion to be found playing small \u2013 in setting for a life that is less than one you are capable of living.\u201d (Red.org, 8 Ways Nelson Mandela Changed the World, Red.org)."
"Even after being hired, he quickly worked his ranks up again and succeeded in his tasks quickly and efficiently. He was so well with brutally enforcing Hitler\u2019s and his murderous plans that he was given the title Reichsssecherheitshauptamt (Washington). This would continue until he used his success for a much worse purpose than to possibly gain more power."
"They believed in \u201cEqual but separate. \u201d, they always taught their kids to be good and their good deed will be rewarded. This point was proven when white people gave the narrator a scholarship. At that point he had caught glimpses of the cruelty of the white society but still he was very grateful for that scholarship hence, it blindfolded him from the real truth. Moreover, Desiree chose death for herself because she thought she had nothing left to live for in this world, she was treated like an outcast. Of course we can argue that she had to live for her baby, but in the end she did what she did to save both of them."
"This reference is of value to my research because by showing that the effects of having no illegal immigrants would significantly open up more jobs, even though there would be a negative outcome, it would still give opportunities for pay to more American citizens. If the work he had done represented a country that had no minimum wage then his findings would have been conflicting with my paper, however because the U.S. does have minimum wage it reverses all of the results because it leads to the conflict theory where there is \u201cjob\u00a0competition between domestic unskilled workers and immigrants.\u201d (Palivos 132)"
"In any organization, there has to be people you interact with, as one cannot work in a vacuum. Students are supposed to engage other staff members not necessarily the faculty because on one way or another they have to seek for assistance. For example, in campus most students are not aware on how to deal with peer pressure, relationships and they need help to handle and cope with this. That\u2019s the reason we have counseling departments which helps to handle cases to do with such or any other family matter which can have adverse effect to their education life."
"Prisons are broken down in a variety of ways, and one of those ways include being broken down by race. Prison has and will remain a breeding ground for racial issues; in other words racial tensions are able to play themselves out in prison. People began to notice their every difference instead of the deafening similarities when it comes to being oppressed in a system that ushers in through the revolving door."
"Faced with a complete stranger, you have to try to act both cool and friendly as you are asked all sorts of questions. Some questions are personal: \u201cWhat is your greatest weakness? \u201d Others are confusing: \u201cWhy should we hire you? \u201d The interview probably takes about twenty minutes but seems like two hours. Finally, you go home and wait for days and even weeks."
"Secondly, some people do deserve this harsh punishment for their wicked act against humanity. A serial murderer who slaughtered dozens of innocent children, a terrorist who launched an attack that killed hundreds\u2014can you figure out a better penalty to resort to for paying the blood these beasts have spilled? Even relatively lighter crime like corruption might result in life long imprisonment, what then, the crime a degree higher like mass murder should be punished with other than \u2018an early road to hell\u2019? I just wonder how many people in the world would be willing to spare a terrorist who blasted off 3200 lives in 9."
"The United States has a harsh history of segregation in the schools. In 1954, Brown v. Board of Education, this was an instrumental turning point in starting the process of equal opportunity for all children in school. Although many areas of the United States were slow to make the changes the Court ruled on, this was a powerful moment in the history of our education."
"Champion among the most profitable and advanced organizations ever. The attributes of the ancient Roman culture assumed a significant part of old writing, and similar components received into the present society. The Roman Empire was a solid hold over the Mediterranean for a long time. Being the objective of almost all world pioneers, the Romans needed land alongside their energy."
"Commercial production of alcohol was well underway by 1500 BC, Court Wright, (as cited at www. asnwers. com/library). Alcohol is probably the oldest drug known to humanity. It was easy for the primitive people to discover that fruits and juices left to stand in warm places easily fermented to form alcoholic mixtures. Alcohol production is mainly founded on yeast cells, which in presence of warmth and 9 water continue to grow by using up the sugar until the sugar is finished or alcohol content kills them."
"In fact, a study of Higher Education faculty in the USA showed that 64% agreed with the statement \u201cDoes teaching to a student\u2019s learning style enhance learning?\u201d(Dandy& Bendersky, 2014 cited in Newton & Miah, 2017). Another study done in the UK found that although 58% of academics in UK Higher Education believe that Learning Styles are e\ufb00ective, only about a third actually uses them (Newton &Miah, 2017)."
"Deci and Ryan (1985) proposed the Self-determination Theory and believed it was three dimensions of motivation instead of uni-dimensional in 2000 after doing some reviews of the theory. The three dimensions of motivation are intrinsic, extrinsic, and amotivation (Deci & Ryan, 2000). Intrinsic motivation is described as engaging in an activity that the individual finds pleasurable, exciting, and enjoyable (Deci & Ryan, 1985). There is a link between intrinsic motivation and academic achievement (Areepattamannil et al, (2011). There are three subcategories of intrinsic motivation, which are intrinsic motivation towards knowledge, accomplishment, and stimulation (Vallerand et al. 1989, Deci & Ryan, 2000). On the other hand, extrinsic motivation is defined as engaging in an activity to attain rewards after its completion. There are four subcategories of extrinsic motivation, which are external regulation, introjected regulation, identified regulation, and integrated regulation (Deci & Ryan, 2000). Amotivation is described as not engaging in an activity due to lacking intention (Deci & Ryan, 1985)."
"You will keep your parents happy by marrying a fellow Hindu in the correct manner. If you do not, there may be a major disagreement in which your family may not ever fully forgive you. They may even believe that in abandoning the correct tradition of marriage, you are abandoning the Hindu religion."
"There was more respect for African Americans who were becoming educated and rising to the top of jobs such as judges and doctors. Although the Fresh Prince of Bel Air delt with African Americans being accepted into a white man\u2019s world, the sitcom also showed the one thing that African Americans cannot seem to leave behind them, discrimination. The show reminds African American\u2019s that although they have come a long way since Martin Luther King, they still continued to meet with people that discriminated against them."
"3. What d you think greatest advantage given to Rizal by his travel? Cite concrete example and defend your answer? Rizal\u2019s travel was the biggest contribution for his success in education, ideals, and his eagerness to fulfill his dreams, goals and vision. This achievement made his friend from the other country admire him so much like Professor Ferdinand Blumentritt, an Austrian Linguist and the Director of Ateneo de Leitmeritz, he called Rizal as the \u201cGreatest Filipino\u201d and \u201cthe greatest of the Malayan race\u201d. Praising by that word is so much heart whelming for Rizal. His first travel to Europe is the beginning of his true adventure in his life, socializing in other races and introduce him to the other as a Filipino is one of a proof that he is proud to be a Filipino even though Filipinos at that time was popular of being an Indio but he is proud to represent himself as a Filipino after all."
"He was an eyewitness to the murder of his family and unfortunately the memory of this still haunts him. His bad childhood, have made him in to a very sensitive person. Even though he has immigrated to US to get a better life, he stills live in a ghetto[1] which is seen in 8th sentence in the beginning of the text \u201cBaluta washed in the shower, cold after his brother and sister-in-law had had theirs\u201d this quotation shows how poor they are, because they don\u2019t have enough hot water for three people to shower in the morning. But not only the problem with the hot water shows how poor they are, the car Baluta use to go to work every day is in such bad condition that Jota refers to it as the \u201c Swiss Chevy\u201d like the Swiss cheese. And the attempts of the duct-tape patchwork and the whistling sound the car makes at speed, clarifies the state of it."
"The decline of American foreign policy has caused another world-wide phenomenon: the US being thought of as a large, friendly dog: the country is accepted as a potentially dangerous one, but is regarded not so dangerous as to be influential enough. The losing on influence can also be considered as another sign of weakening. This is, at least, what other countries perceive from \u201cthe changing nature of the American power.\u201d(Huntington) This change from the hard (military, financial, political) kind of power to the soft (business, food, technology) kind of power has created a change of directions, too: it rather attracts people, business and interests than drives them away. This is very clearly shown by the figures of 1963 and 1997 in the Huntington article."
"Desiree is the true victim in this particular story. The current social environment made her feel ashamed of her assumed mixed ancestry. After all, an African child begins life as a slave and endures an extremely treacherous life. The same was true of children born to white and black parents. These children were labeled \u201cmulattoes\u201d, and contrary to thoughts of lighter skinned blacks being more acceptable to white people, their lives were as treacherous or worse. Desiree\u2019s situation was due to racial assumptions and although being mulatto was no fault her own, the suffering and cruelty cast upon this group was unimaginable. Blacks, mulattoes and other non-whites were not considered second class citizens, in fact, they were not citizens at all."
"In both articles, there was a lot of disagreement between Trump and Clinton on different topics. In article one, they argued on guns. Trumps wants to run a strong defender of gun rights. On the other hand, Clinton wants to take guns away. She just does not want people to be shot by someone who should not have a gun in the first place. She wants to expand on background checks for gun buyers. In the second article, there were many topics where both candidates disagreed."
"The essence of the strategy is simple. It implies to minimize losses and maximize benefits. \u00a0In other words, it is indispensable to create the opportunity to receive so many migrants so that it would be beneficial to the economy and not threaten the security of a person, society, and the state. Proceeding from this, the strategy implementation tool should be formed and applied."
"Growing up around violent video games and television shows leads children down a road of accepting aggression. What this means is that the youth believes it is normal to become aggressive in real life. Now this may not be the same level of aggressiveness as shown in video games, but it is still an increase from the normal level. Another effect that video games have caused is the desensitization to violence. What this means is when playing these violent video games, children become so accustomed to this violence."
"Letters, Messages, and Tokens Twelfth Night features a great variety of messages sent from one character to another\u2014sometimes as letters and other times in the form of tokens. Such messages are used both for purposes of communication and miscommunication\u2014sometimes deliberate and sometimes accidental. Maria\u2019s letter to Malvolio, which purports to be from Olivia, is a deliberate (and successful) attempt to trick the steward. Sir Andrew\u2019s letter demanding a duel with Cesario, meanwhile, is meant seriously, but because it is so appallingly stupid, Sir Toby does not deliver it, rendering it extraneous. Malvolio\u2019s missive, sent by way of Feste from the dark room in which he is imprisoned, ultimately works to undo the confusion caused by Maria\u2019s forged letter and to free Malvolio from his imprisonment."
"Immigration has had a lot of impact on American citizen\u2019s dream since the late 1800s-1900s. Approximately ten-million immigrants entered America. To live the American dream would be to live in peace without worrying about money, safety, or hunger. Money plays a big part in the American dream. American dreams are becoming distant when it comes to immigration, wealth, and self-belief."
"I am politically pro-choice, but personally pro-life. A statement said so vaguely, but weights heavily on women seeking abortion. Women should have the latitude that is free from government intrusion to make their own healthcare decisions. Women should have the latitude that is free from government intrusion to make their own healthcare decisions because they are singular best situated to choose a course, they should live their values not legislate them, and last it\u2019s the foundation of liberty."
"Considering the challenge teenage pregnancy encounter, it is critical that programs continue to go beyond medical information like birth control, resisting peer pressure and teach about taking responsibility. Children need to be asked questions. From an early age, parents often avoid even labelling sexual parts. From an early age, children should become comfortable with the names of all their body parts and become comfortably knowledgeable about body part similarities and differences between boys and girls (Gordon, 1983; Honig, 1978)."
"We should not expect all of out most important lessons to be learned in the buildings we call schools. \u201d # 31. \u201cWe are all influenced in lasting ways \u2013 whether positive or negative \u2013 by the particular kind of community in which we grow up. \u201d #10. \u201cAlthough the marvels of technology surround us every day, there are moments when we all would give anything to be freed from that technology. -I agree. I miss the days before cell phones when I was not accessable 24 7 to everyone. I think are all due some private \u201cquite\u201d time."
"The research also had a good, large sample of participants (around 160 ppts from various age and backgrounds). They found that when asked about the greatest factor in breaking up a friendship, women tended to identify lack of emotional support, while men were concerned with lack of joking. Younger participants took public criticism more seriously, whereas older people (over 20s), said that lack of respect and requests for personal advice were more important."
"Child abuse is defined as \u201cwhen a parent or caregiver, whether through action or failing to act, causes injury, death, emotional harm or risk of serious harm to a child\u201d(ChildHelp, 2018). When a child is born unwanted, the risk of child abuse is much higher. The parents often feel like their child is a burden, so they care much less about the child. Child abuse can cause detrimental effects to the child through learning, developing, or even just their mental state. Studies have shown that 80% of adults who were abused as a child met the criteria for at least one mental health disorder (ChildHelp,2018). Making abortion illegal leaves so many children at risk to being born into a home where they are unwanted, where they are abused, or where they are not cared about."
"The defendant said he was informed the worm weighed at least 1300 cwt and was worth more than 401. The defendant asked him if he could warrant it to weigh so much, and receiving a answer in the negative he then declared that he would not take it, and refused to pay for it. It was re-sold on the subsequent day\u2019s sale for 301 to the defendant. Against which the action was brought for the difference."
"Baptist Hospital is committed to creating an all-encompassing environment that embraces all people and cultures. It has been a great example of having cultural diversity and inclusion, it is a driven organization, that truly recognizes that diversity is key for success. Baptist Hospital is a multicultural workforce who are committed to creating an inclusive environment and embracing all people and cultures. Being an employee of Baptist Hospital for about 15 years, I have witnessed and experienced the multitude of cultural richness."
"At the same time of Steinbeck, everyone is thinking about their own land, and how to retire and live in their own homes with their land, The American Dream. But things don\u2019t go how they planned for them to, and The Great Wall Street Crash occurred on October 4th 1929, this was when the people had gone bankrupt and everyone\u2019s life savings were wiped away, many peoples dreams were shattered to pieces right in front of them. America went in to shock. Jobs were lost which caused even more problems, soon after The Great Wall Street Crash people started to migrate in to the countryside of California for jobs and a second chance to build back what they had lost."
"Pavlov and Watson came up with a theory of their own called behaviorism the study of behavior well according to Cacioppo and Freberg (2016:16) in a more defined way they said that it\u2019s an approach to psychology that features the study and careful measurements of observable behaviors. Pavlov even took it a step further by now studying the effects of learning in animals his most known experiment involved dogs being fed food but before a metronome was rung and then the dogs started salivating and he came up with a term called classical conditioning. In every day examples we would see classical conditioning in that every time we have to receive results we get so anxious other people even faint while waiting for them."
"My research focuses on and investigates knowledge and perception on the importance of race, and how denial affects us all. White privilege is a social relation that benefits white persons over non-white persons. A said advantage enjoyed by persons of a socially privileged class based on the color of their skin. A racial category, which involves European-Americans and the \u201cinvisible norm\u201d (IAW. 350) against other racial categories."
"A key factor to the activity being considered a recreational activity is whether or not it is pleasurable. If the activity is not pleasurable then the activity cannot be considered recreational because it is not rejuvenating to the body or mind. For example, a couple travels to the Caribbean for a second honeymoon. They have planned the vacation far in advance and the tickets and reservations are non-refundable. Upon arriving, the weather is awful and the couple is unable to participate in any of the activities they had planned for the trip."
"Small details such as recognizing black history month or women\u2019s history month, helps to also create an environment where partners feel they are being recognized personally. Through its efforts to create a diverse work environment, it is clear to see when walking into a store that the idea of diversity may not include the older population. Mr. Ogo believes that this may not entirely be the fault of Starbucks alone. One would be correct in assuming that there is no one over forty behind the counter of a Starbucks, but there never seem to be any applications from the older generations. Mr.\u00a0Ogo believes that this may have to do with intimidation upon walking in to drop off an application just to see a lot of young people behind the counter, including the manager."
"Third, sharing or introducing each the culture. At this point you can introduce the culture widely and evidently such tradition, custom, and other introducing of culture include language, people, lifestyle, art or festival in your country. Example, if foreigners stay in your country, you can introduce or go to those cultural places directly such as national museum, any theaters or restaurant, where has national foods. Your relationship will grow if you illustrate deeper. Of course, it is really joyful to share, describe each other like historical location or festivals. At this point,\u00a0other introducing of each culture include"
"Express your feelings, affections, friendship and ardour to humans around you. They will most in all likelihood reciprocate your actions. Try now not to maintain pent up anger of frustrations, this is bad for your health. Instead discover methods of expressing them in a way that will now not cause greater harm or hurt to anyone."
"According to Duvall\u2019s (1957) 8 stages of family development. This family is categorized in Stage 4, families with school-aged children. The tasks involved in this stage are mainly (1) giving encouragements to the child based on his/her educational achievements, (2) encouraging the child to create relationships outside of the family and (3) allowing the parents to learn and adjust to the child overall development"
"We used the flashback to go from the adults on stage to the tainted memory of the nativity play, this worked very well as we were in the same positions and the change between our adult characters and child characters was visible even though we had the same qualities. We used a freeze frame to separate our childhood scenes; we ended each scene with one. Repetition is where you repeat something you have already performed, often with a small change to it. We used repetition when we went from one childhood memory to a tainted childhood memory; the scene was the same apart from a few details."
"In fact, in some parts of France, this system is already in place. In these areas, all women are obliged to wear the standardized Islamist \u201chijab\u201d while most men grow their beards to the length prescribed by the sheiks. The radicals have managed to chase away French shopkeepers selling alcohol and pork products, forced \u201cplaces of sin,\u201d such as dancing halls, cinemas and theaters, to close down, and seized control of much of the local administration."
"In addition when the atmosphere begins to be filled with too many greenhouse gases the temperature becomes too hot, plants begin to die. Global warming causes the increase in pests and insect population, harming crops like, Soybean, wheat, corn. Although warmer temperatures create longer growing seasons and faster growth rates of plans it also increases the metabolic rate and number of breeding cycles of insect populations. Global warming also causes changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and ground level ozone concentration. Added heat stress, shifting monsoons, and dryer soils May reduce yields by as much as a third in the tropics and subtropics, where crops are already near their maximum heat tolerance (UNEP)."
"People believe the hype that Canada is a nation of cultural tolerance but that\u2019s totally not true. Racism is prejudice, judgment, or resentment directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one\u2019s race is superior to the other{s}Racism is also a form of hate. Being racist is a choice; no one is born with hate implanted in them. Before I came to Canada, I did not experience any form of racism, for the couple of years I have lived in Canada I have experienced racism in every organization I have worked for one of the most challenging aspects of the struggle for equality is the systemic character of discrimination."
"Being married is important in the Hindu society. This is because marriage in Hinduism is not seen as a lifestyle choice but a duty and religious stage of life, from \u2018student\u2019, the first ashrama, to \u2018householder\u2019, the second ashrama according to the Varna-ashrama-dharma. When married, a Hindu has the opportunity to achieve three goals:"
"Focusing not on the hardships and devastation of the war but on the new opportunities to rebuild, the story has struck many critics for its optimism and positive outlook. At the same time, \u201cCivil Peace\u201d insidiously demonstrates the similarities between Nigeria during the war and after the war\u2014during both periods, violence and corruption can emerge at any time."

"In addition, as these youth become parents, programs that work with young children can assist parents with parental support and literacy improvement. For second and third generations, and for immigrants who do enter California schools, the quality of the K\u201312 public education system is clearly a key factor in success. Several recent and continuing reforms are improving California schools, particularly in the areas of student achievement, teacher quality, and quality of facilities. In addition, English language learning is of concern for the children of immigrants."
"The bible is saying that human life is precious, so abortion can be seen as a precious waste and should not be performed. But if you don\u2019t think that the foetus is a human life at the time then you may not see it as precious and/or a waste. Also, all life is precious to God, so if the mother\u2019s life is at risk, it could be argued that, as she is valuable to God, she should be allowed an abortion."
"Furthermore, introverted, balanced, mature, self-centered, calm, composed, romantic, thoughtful, and peace-loving people prefer mountains, while extroverted, active and highly energetic, socially interactive, carefree and cheerful, materialistic, and adventurous people like beaches. The beach people are extroverts who are more prone towards the hip and happening beach life. On the other hand, the mountain people are introverts prefer the peace and quiet of mountains and natural surroundings where they can just be themselves."
"In out of time scenes Jackie is the leader. She is the bravest of the four \u201clet\u2019s kill our mummies\u201d. Rosie agrees but Doris and Margaret go home. Jackie is the leader of the group. I think this reflects her role in reality because she is set apart from the others by her determination and independence as a person. Jackie being the youngest too understand voodoo and spells which the others do not. Margaret and Doris get scared because their lives have now involved things like voodoo."
"One thing that both of these articles have in common is that they both have the same theme and overall focus, integration of schools and equal opportunity for all. The article from Social Studies for Kids says \u201d The integration came about as a result of a court order, not as a result of a request from the school.\u201d It talks about how not many white people wanted Ruby at their school. In the NPR article Ruby talks about how \u201cif you build a first-class school, an environment that you say, you know, will be diverse, we\u2019re going to devote so much attention to diversity and teaching them values and having them learn side-by-side, I do believe that that somehow will help to close the gap.\u201d Both articles focus on segregation of schools contributing to the problem of inequality. This explains why Ruby\u2019s family allowed her to be exposed to a hostile environment. They were hoping that their small child would help make a larger impact on the world by helping bring about equality for people of all races."
"Friendship is a special bond between two or more people. This relationship is built on the basis of trust, loyalty and honesty. In the play Othello, Shakespeare demonstrates these qualities through many of his characters to portray their deep friendships. However as the play progresses these friends turn into foes as many problems occur in their friendships and lead to many tragic events. The negative qualities that tore these friendships apart are distrust, selfishness and jealousy that led many of the characters to their tragedies."
"This novel has made me believe in the importance of educating young people on events and issues, like genocide (eg the Rwandan Genocide of 1994, only 18 years ago, where an estimated 7 Tutsi citizens were brutally murdered every minute for 100 days! ) and racism, in order to prevent the future from becoming a place like in \u2018Noughts and Crosses\u2019. How are we to learn from the mistakes of mankind if we are never educated on them? \u201cDreams of living in a world with no more discrimination, no more prejudice, a fair police force, an equal justice system, equality of education, equality of life, a level playing field\u2026 \u201d His name is Andy. \u201d"
"Having a college degree often leads individuals into a secure and a well-paying job in order to adequately support their family. In today\u2019s society and principles, individuals with a college degree are viewed to be more devoted, well-informed, teachable, and respected to potential businesses. Additionally, when I was younger and inexperienced, my day dreams were of going college and gaining the experience that would lead me to a successful career. Unnecessary time had passed; and unfortunately, I had to work instead of continuing on with school."
"Caroline Howarth brought out the 2nd research. The individuals all lived in the Brixton location, which was seen as a poor and violent place and likewise where a great deal of black people were believed to have lived there and were considered being the main reason for violence. Within the very first set of focus groups (overall of 7), she asked teens to speak about Brixton, she inquired to \u2018inform me about Brixton\u2013 what it is like for you to live here and how individuals outside Brixton think about Brixton\u2019. Howarth utilized a topic guideline to ensure that main research concerns were always covered (on community, addition, exclusion, identity, ethnicity, the media, prejudice, bigotry, the school)."
"Children with special needs should be given the opportunity to play for example, if a child is in a wheel chair they will need more space or if they have hearing or sight problems make it so they feel comfortable. \u201cThe term \u2018physical play\u2019 is a term that can be used to describe the type of play in which children use their large muscle and exercise their whole body. They learn to control large and small muscles and develop co-oration, and surplus energy is expended."
"My identity has been impacted in many ways, some do not think white people are African, but how can I not be when African is all I know. To me, I am more African than some. As a child in 1994 starting grade 1, with a classroom filled with multi-racial students was clearly a pivotal point in South Africa, little did I know back then how important that was. We as pure children did not judge one another, we all became friends regardless of our skin tone. I will never forget playing Barbie\u2019s with a Zulu girl on the playground at breaks, she had a \u201cblack\u201d Barbie and I had a \u201cwhite\u201d Barbie and we were so eager and so excited to make a trade as we loved how different we were and how different our Barbie\u2019s were. Twenty-five years later I may even still have that Barbie, as I hold on to it for memories and to pass it on to my own children. My children will learn what it truly means to be African and what Ubuntu really stands for, having this common bond amongst us all, through all the interactions with human beings. We are humans first before we are anything else."
"It turns out that this hidden stash of money never existed. Everett confesses to his fellow escapees that he had received a letter from his ex-wife telling him that she is getting remarried to a \u201cbona fide\u201d suitor. Everett\u2019s quest was actually to recapture his lost love. After arguing about Everett\u2019s lie, the three men continue to face challenges en route to find Everett\u2019s wife."
"Mistreatment of foreign workers; exploitation by labour agents and contractors; denial of equal access to benefits and protection guaranteed to Malaysian workers; harassment and persecution by government-sanctioned vigilante organizations such as Rela (there was a notorious \u2018Catch a illegal migrant and get paid for it\u2019 campaign which ran in 2005 and 2006 that attracted much international criticism) \u2013 these actions are contrary to accepted norms of human decency and have rightly given Malaysians and Malaysia a bad name."
"5. Compare the final population pyramid for Italy to the one you sketched of Nigeria. How do they compare, and why are they similar and different? What do you think accounts for the difference? The final population pyramid for Italy and Nigeria are similar in the way that the population is stable and\u00a0the population growth has reached 0% or is very close to zero. Italy reached a stable population much earlier than Nigeria. While the total population for Italy stayed small, Nigeria has approximately 7-9 times more population for each age group. Italy is further in the demographic transition and already had a declining growth rate keeping the population fairly small. In contrast, Nigeria is barely a developing country with a much higher growth rate thus creating a greater ending population. In terms of land and rural area, Nigeria has more land to expand and sustain this population size."
"For instance the whites who protested for the industrial conciliation act enactment are the whites who were feeling threatened by the black society and those white who were on top of the socio-economic hierarchy felt no intimidation by blacks .there, as thus discussed above one might possibly say that it is clear from the aforesaid argument that scapegoating and social identity theory can explain prejudice from various angles as expulsed in the argument in question ."
"Due to the desire of finding his self-identity, Miles concludes to move to Culver Creek. Establishing this change of setting is significant because it contributes to the teenager to eventually discover his unique individualism and his purpose in relation to life. Once his parents finalized Mile\u2019s dormroom and said their goodbyes, he concludes that he \u201c. . . should have felt a gooey, sentimental sadness. . .\u201d (Green 10)."
"This shows the character herself feels irrelevant in the open field. She feels that she is unwanted and no one considers her so no one would need to know her name. Curley\u2019s Significant other is likewise basically familiar with different people as \u201cCurley\u2019s Better half\u201d, I recognize that Steinbeck does this to show that Curley, her cherished one, is liable for her, in that breaking point countless different women in 1930 in various conditions."
"Developing a strong corporate reputation is a fundamental tool in ensuring that Ryanair remains a reputable airline company in the industry. Indeed, this calls for compelling communication frameworks among the stakeholders of the company. True, the airline industry features as extremely diverse; hence, the need for investing in the best publicity platforms. Spreading information is an aspect of publicity that should be implemented with ease in order for the company to increase its chances of success.

Thus, initiating feasible publicity frameworks is a credible way of surfacing a strong corporate reputation by improving communication among the key stakeholders in Ryanair airlines."
"The details of the novel reflect the treatment of women in those times. Women belong to their husbands. Women should stay inside the house. Women do not belong in a workplace, especially a ranch. Every initial detail of the book reinforces the prejudice against women, but when a reader continues reading the novel, they begin to realize that Curley\u2019s wife is more than this."
"It is no secret that they key to obtaining a high paying job in today\u2019s society is a college degree, but single mothers barely have time to fit school into their schedules. In-between working and being the sole caretaker for their children its challenging finding time to fit school into the mix. The Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research conducted a study where the analyzed how single mothers who are in college spend their time outside of school. In a day, 2 hours are spent of solely taking care of their children, 6 hours are spent watching their children while completing household chores or duties such as cooking or cleaning, 2 hours are spent of doing work around the house. That\u2019s a total of nine hours spent on caring for their children and house, compared to the 2 hours that students without children spend of house work a day. That combined with the lack of sleep, lack of exercise, and lack of a social life causes single-mothers to drop out of college. According to Lindsey Reichlin Cruse, a researcher at IWPR, single mothers in college are doing double and triple duty to make a better life for their families, but too few have the support needed to juggle the competing time demands of college, parenthood, and employment.\u201d To free of some time for single-mothers to attend college child care should be provided by the school. It is very uncommon for college to have child-care centers for students to use, and those schools that do have them have waiting list for their on-campus child-care centers. On average, there are about 80 children on college\u2019s child-care waiting lists. A community college in Rochester, New York called Monroe Community College has on campus child-care for students. Between the years of 2006 and 2014, 30 percent of their students who used the on-campus child-care services were more likely to return polling semesters than the student who did not use on campus child-care."
"The case of six-year old Adam Walsh is perhaps one that will never leave the minds of anyone initially horrified by its details. In 1981 young Adam was kidnapped from a local mall and regardless of tireless efforts by his parents John and Reve Walsh, volunteers, and law enforcement; Adam fell victim to murder. Two weeks after the boy went missing, his decapitated head was located, but his body was never found. This prompted his father John Walsh to start a campaign and legislature policy submission toward more stringent accountability for child crime offenders."
"So, what does this new law mean for the women and girls in Alabama? what about the women who can\u2019t afford to bring up a child, or of whom has no means of support for her child in their current living situation. OR\u2026. even the extreme case where the woman is a victim of rape or incest? Well, the new law means that such women, even some of the most vulnerable women in society are forced to carry a child through a full term with only one exception to these law makers."
"In most cases it becomes a habit and can be tough to break. Teenage girls in the world today have very little respect for themselves because they really don\u2019t know any better. They are just following the pattern that women have been following for generations. In society\u2019s eyes as well as their own they are not wrong. My desire for them is that they will be taught that they are very special and they deserve so much more than they think. I\u00a0pray everyday that they will realize God loves them more than anyone ever could. They have so much to offer, if they just believe in and respect themselves."
"Chris not liking new places shows us that he is scared of the outside world,\u201d But once we start to doubt Chris\u2019 ability to go out into the world, he surprises us and proves us wrong. He goes on a whole adventure to places he does not know, just in the name to see his mother. It is a known fact that sacrifices are a part of our lives. We make them for our own desires and our loved ones. Our sacrifices can be big or small depending on what we intend to accomplish. For Chris we see him make a big sacrifice by doing something he horribly hates, going to a new place with lots of people (subway)."
"There are many alternative sides once it involves abortion. One aspect ar those that decision themselves \u201cpro-life\u201d. they assert that designedly caused abortion is often wrong even supposing on terribly rare occasions it\u2019s the simplest factor to try and do. On the opposite aspect is those that decision themselves \u201cpro-choice\u201d or the supported of abortion and its rights. They notice that intentional abortion is suitable in any circumstance."
"Awareness of/ class consciousness can allow for an individual to set realistic attainable goals such as owning a pizza shop (like one of the Hangers aspires to do) but a complete unawareness of it can cause lifelong detrimental disappointment. It\u2019s difficult for all of the men to see the world through the lens of race and class. They just see things as they do and that\u2019s it. Unfortunately social reproduction is highly likely to re-occur for the children of these men. Despite any positive relationships that any of the men have with their female companions and children, their offspring are automatically born into social inequality considering their neighborhoods and even physical factors such as premature birth due to parents\u2019 drug issues. Despite whether or not or how much they assert their learned upbringing or any rational parenting techniques that they decide on, social inequality still exists all around them, in their pasts most definitely and in the present for some of them as well."
"The last few months had been difficult for me and my family, but I was able to gain new knowledge from my experiences. Seeing what hardships my mother and father had to go through helped me gain a new perspective and realize how hard my parents work every single day, and being separated from my family showed me how much that they do for me and allowed me to appreciate them on a far larger scale. I now know to show my appreciation when my parents do something for me and support them during difficult times. It\u2019s important to acknowledge everything the people who care about do for you and realize the struggles and hardships they go through every single day."
"The pair fit like puzzle pieces filling in what the other doesn\u2019t have. It is inspiring to see a tremendous friendship bloom in such a despairing time. The two clearly distinguish themselves from \u201cthem other guys\u201d (15) and the times they are by each other are the times they truly thrive."
"Immigrants who lived in the U.S as residents for six consecutive years could then apply to become permanent resident (Ruth, M). They would receive permanent residency only if they were attending an institute of higher education such as a college. Have been honorably discharged from the US armed forces after at least two or more years. Passing consecutive background checks and continuing to display strong moral character. The Dream Act fails to pass Congress multiple times between the years 2001 and 2011 due to low number of votes."
"A couple has to share everything with each other. When the husband tries to hide something then the wife will lose her faith and it leads to conflict circumstances this is what occurs in the life of Ananda and Nina. She understands the circumstances that she is emotionally, financially and socially heavily dependent on him. Now she determines to be independent economically \u201cFrom now on, I will only buy clothes when I have money of my own\u201d"
"In conclusion, the death penalty should not be passed to people today, as it is not ethical. As stated above, the death penalty leads to the execution of innocent people, and for that reason, it should be banned entirely. Again, the death sentence should be abolished as statistics have shown that the sentence is not supportive when it comes to bringing the rates of crime down, as seen in a number of crime-infested states in the US. Moreover, the death sentence should be abolished as it is not morally and ethically correct in the world today. In addition, with the cruelty of how the death penalty is practiced, like through lethal injection and electrocution, no doubt that the policy should be written off."
"Jack Mathews wrote, \u201cThere was a time during and immediately after the war, when South Central Los Angeles represented the American Dream top blacks who migrated there for jobs in the area\u2019s booming aircraft industry, and then the American Disappointment, as they became the first to lose their jobs when the boom ended.\u201d (423). Easy\u2019s dreams were almost shattered when he lost is job because of racial motivation.\u00a0 His fear of losing his home ultimately drove him to seek work that under other circumstances he would have never taken."
"\u201cI Am Mordred\u201d by Nancy Springer embodies the style of pre-destination. She interweaves the conflict of pre-destination and free-will in the main plot of the story that perpetuates till the end in one type or the other. There are specific secondary styles that overlap with the primary theme of pre-destination i. e. unnaturality, ambivalence in human nature and so on. Ms. Springer shows that Mordred is a prey to his fate. His patricide can not be represented as a simple vengeance as prediction plays a main part in bringing him to the altar of pre-destination."
"\u201cEmpathy is the capacity to recognize or understand another\u2019s state of mind or emotion. It is often characterized as the ability to \u201cput oneself into another\u2019s shoes\u201d, or to in some way experience the outlook or emotions of another being within oneself\u201d There are so many fascinating explanations of empathy on the internet. What it really comes down to is putting \u201cyourself in another their shoes\u201d and viewing the world in the way that they would."
"Amazon Incorporation\u2019s mission of becoming the earth\u2019s most customer centric organization is central to its diversity and inclusion policy. The company is constantly looking for means to strengthen its culture of inclusion. In particular, the organization has 10 worker-led affinity groups reaching more than 40,000 workers in close to 200 chapters across the globe. The company offers inventive benefit offerings and numerous annual learning experiences such as \u201cConversations on Race and Ethnicity\u201d, as well as AmazeCon conferences. The latter focuses on gender diversity."
"The language becomes more sophisticated as it advances such as a child learning more \u2018big words\u2019 (e.g. \u2018that for an hour, then a skittle of milk\u2019 transcends to \u2018fractions under a heavy, sexy sky\u2019). The content also changes from childhood innocence (\u2018Some mornings, you found she\u2019d left a gold star by your name\u2019) to sexual awareness (see heavy, sexy sky comment, also \u2018you ran through the gates, impatient to be grown, as the sky split open into a thunderstorm\u2019)."
"Alternatively, the inherited superiority of white people has scarred Audre Lorde, and she understands that she is not equal \u2013 according to her essay. She struggles with her classification and identity, separating American citizens into different categories. Since racism is very prevalent, her newfound adulthood coincides with her revelation that America is not the country she thought it was. She feels exposed to the realities of life; from a child to a woman. What was once a thought of a perfect country is spoiled by injustice and racism as she faces discrimination and oppression."
"In regards to American films however, one would have to sit down personally with directors and producers of 1990s films to determine if they intentionally created these magical Negro characters in order to perpetuate racism. Aside from the fact that it is highly unlikely that anyone would ever openly admit to that, I personally think that cinethetic racism and the magical Negro were just an unintended consequence of a fad that was going on throughout Hollywood at the time, the fad being to have black people portray certain qualities of wisdom and \u201cmagical powers\u201d within films."
"One day Papa decided to leave home in search of a dream he had. Mama was sad and she cried. Papa\u2019s dream was repetitive, if you were a close friend to him he will tell you that Jesus called him. Jesus will intrude in his mind to show a barren plain. It was dead with no vegetation and isolated from any living thing. Jesus will hand him over a seed to Papa\u2019s hand, He told Papa to plant the seed where they stood, Jesus told Papa he was to build his house there."
"This system only furthers the socioeconomic gap between the rich and the poor. Although I am not sure whether the government had deliberate intentions to prevent minorities from closing this gap, it really appears like they did. This colonialist method of exploiting the weak to obtain monetary gain seems to persist today, with its cause leading back to what we thought had completely ceased to exist but clearly continues to linger throughout current society: the exploitation of minorities."
"The September 11th terrorist attacks will forever remain a painful and transitional part of American history, especially for those who were made aware of its impact as well as those that even both directly and indirectly affected. The widespread effect that it left in the hearts of many Americans continues to this day and unfortunately has engraved certain negative connotations in the minds of several narrow-minded individuals towards people of foreign nationalities and religions in the form of Xenophobia. As long as these individuals never recover from this disorder, people of Islamic beliefs and South Asian heritage will continue to be treated with prejudice, and disrespect through the emotions of fear and judgment. Due to the actions of a few individuals, entire populations of innocent people were made scapegoats and may have lived with this truth for the rest of their lives (Iftikhar, npr.org)."
"Halfway through the poem, the author shifts from third to first person \u201cwords could bring the face that I / no longer knew or loved\u2026\u201d Those first person lines suggest to the readers that the speaking persona could have undergone the same kind of treatment. The line \u201cwell, it is over now, it is over\u201d is a potent hint that the narrator is recalling his past."
"19. Marcus\u2019 diary entry struck me most because it\u2019s so unfair that human beings are judged by other human beings by their skin colour when it shouldn\u2019t be considered as a negative factor because underneath it all we\u2019re all the same. When Clive, accidentally shot himself and he stayed by his side until the police came the assumption shouldn\u2019t have automatically been that Marcus did it because he was black, it was so unfair especially when Marcus lost his best friend that day. Marcus\u2019 story moved me the most because he is still searching for his freedom after being wrongfully locked up. If Marcus had never been blamed for Clive\u2019s death and had never gone behind bars, his life could\u2019ve been different. \u201cEvery day I worry, when will I be free?\u201d"
"Nina faces the problem of settlement in Canada. She believes that she will control all the things and definitely have a better future in the foreign country. Ananda and Nina are the newly married couple, struggle to modify their life in Canadian society. Ananda continuously says to Nina about the difference of the countries. Actually, he determines of foreign lifestyle. But, Nina is still new to the country. On the contrary, Ananda never welcomes the traditional behaviour of Nina. She really confuses whether to wear traditional or western clothes. While analyzing the values of Indian and Western, remarks Ashok Kumar says:"
"This will help them still enjoy living to its fullest because it will allow them still do most of the things they enjoy doing. Finally, many people also tend to forget that retirement homes also help elderly people\u2019s families deal with the logistics of caring with an elderly loved one. Many of us have elderly loved ones that need more help than what we can provide by ourselves. This is true because many of us have jobs and other responsibilities that make it difficult for people to take care of an elderly loved one who needs help with daily activities."
"God created men and women to build their life together and to complete one another for a lifetime. They are to wade through all the fields of struggle in life side by side with men, supporting each other, helping, and completing one another. Men and women are protectors of one another. Lastly, women in the 1950\u2019s didn\u2019t have much opportunity of anything. The only role they were able to play was motherhood and a homemaker. The brave women that chose to learn further were not taught mathematics and science (fields they were later going to succeed in) but home economics and cooking."
"It is certainly a positive and empowering gesture, however, projects such as these are often only seen during the month of October, which is Domestic Violence Awareness month and they do not reach the masses on as large of a scale as the influences mentioned above. More recently scholars such as Jackson Katz have shared their perspective on a solution to gender violence. Katz suggests IPV is more of a men\u2019s issue than women\u2019s issue and questions why so many men engage in violent and destructive behavior in this day and age."
"The distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic value is that something has intrinsic value if it is valuable in itself. While something with extrinsic value is valuable as a means to something else. In other words, never use a person to only obtain something in the end because this lowers the person\u2019s respect and dignity as a human being. What gives a person their intrinsic value is their freedom of will. Through autonomy persons have the right to distinguish right from wrong and make their own decisions."
"We have all been into places that your walking and say \u201coh wow this is a great place\u201d to be that participation of young people is vital to their understanding, their thoughts that\u2019s there\u2019s a positive evidence-based curriculum everyone knows what they are doing, what success looks like and what they\u2019re going to do next and that this has patrol care linked to community services and underpinned by brilliant leadership and I think the challenge is about scale about intensity and about resources to make that happen yeah realistically we have to ensure that mental health training is included as part of initial teacher training that teachers need to be thinking about this right at the outset clearly, we need to ensure that every teacher is trained in evidence based mental health awareness in order to create a stronger platform for that culture change both within schools but ultimately within wider communities where we are all able to talk and make sure that metal health is an everyday conversation at schools."
"\u201cJourney beyond the Stars\u201d which is written by Deepak Narang Sawhney, describes Los Angeles with a paradox. On the one hand, it appears as a world city, the capital of the First World, on the other hand as the metropolis of the Third World. All the chapters clearly describe the real conditions of Los Angeles and its surroundings.Los Angeles, considers to be one of the most multicultural cities in the world. Being major global metropolise, one can visibly see the extremes of wealth and socioeconomic inequality."
"\u201cPeople develop a language in order to explain and therefore control their scenarios\u201d (Baldwin 109). Subsequently, language does not necessarily specify identity as much as identity specifies language. People choose what language to utilize in order to communicate with their neighborhoods according to their identities. One\u2019s identity defines and manages using language and not the contrary."
"The results of these stereotypes and gender roles are clear. They lead to a constant search for validation. Because of this, some people may never feel like they fit into society and it can take a serious toll on their mental health. These gender roles and stereotypes are extremely dangerous especially in a society that strictly supports traditional gender roles/stereotypes and poses such a big influence in homes and media."
"As far as the general public goes I am stuck in the middle on this, it would be great for everyone to be in a DNA database, as it would deter crime and solve crimes much faster, but on the downside, giving that kind of information to the government without knowing for sure what they might use it for, other than criminal cases, missing persons or things in that nature, would be an invasion of privacy, and also if the system databases are not secure enough, then people could get tremendous information about you just from your DNA, as in medically, and basically information that\u2019s in your DNA is in your whole family history, sisters, brothers, mother, father, DNA can trace your family history way back to see who you are related to. I think it should be the publics choice whether or not to give samples of DNA."
"This was already seen during the 2003 heatwave in Europe, which claimed approximately 35, 000 lives. In a study by Hadley Center for Climate Prediction and Research in the United Kingdom, scientists using computer models showed how greenhouse gas emissions have increased the likelihood of heatwaves. The most common health effect is hyperthermia or heatstroke that can be fatal if left untreated. IPCC predicts that global warming will lead to hot days, followed by nights of high temperatures."
"This issue is usually avoided in conversation, as it more that usually leads to a debate and argument. This topic doesn\u2019t just touch in religious views, but goes into moral views on life. This touchy subject hasn\u2019t caused any wars, but there are a large number of injuries reported at pro and con protests for abortion. While my mistake hasn\u2019t caused any large repercussions as discussed previously, it is still important to do my best in respecting other cultures and backgrounds. The world isn\u2019t perfect and as we move through time we will see this perfect is even attainable."
"Students who have gone abroad seem to show less of a tendency to engage in academic misconduct, especially when it comes to plagiarism, compared to those without a similar study-abroad experience. Being a foreign student also does not come out as a strong predictor of unethical academic behavior\u201d (Leadsman,2011 25-35) . If a higher educational school is concerned about cheating then they need to provide a smaller class size. If a smaller class size cannot be accomplished then South Korea 15 techniques need to be employed in the classroom to deter cheating and focus strictly n in class work and no take-home projects that could encourage cheating. South Korea also deals with other challenges in their society of how to provide an equitable education for their people."
"The purpose of this research paper is to analyze the most probable effects of single parenting in the age group of 12 years old, which belongs to the developmental phase of pre-adolescent group. The study can be utilized to support the possible acclaims of the pros and cons of single parenting, and even the social issues concerning the topic. Moreover, the research of such topic can greatly elaborate the effects of single parenting to this specific age group, and in the end, may aid in the formulation of the possible parental intervention in order to avoid possible familial conflicts."
"The scene depiction at the beginning is important, as it is that place where Lennie will eventually die. They make the brush seem like such a peaceful natural place, that Lennie seems to be finally at peace when he dies. The scenery around which Lennie dies is very important, as it is another comparison the Candy\u2019s dog. Candy\u2019s dog was in a reasonably recognisable environment but it wasn\u2019t peaceful, or particularly welcoming for him, it was just the most convenient place at the time. This was the same will Lennie\u2019s death except form the fact that George told the story of his dream, one last time to make sure that George was at the peak of his happiness when he joined the deceased. The animals larking about silently tiptoe around the brush, as if they know what a serene dwelling it was. At the beginning of the first segment, the descriptions of the environment around them is very tranquil and all the animals seem to live in harmony with each other but in the last segment of the book, it doesn\u2019t work so well, an you start to see that wildlife can never be that perfect, and for wildlife to be excitant, death is a necessity."
"Congress was under the control of the Senate and the robber barons often used financial bribes to corrupt political officials. Governments at local and state levels were controlled in this manner. The federal government was not much better either as it too was under the influence of big business. Eventually, Congress passed legislation like the Interstate Commerce Act and the Sherman Anti-Trust Act to counteract the excesses of big business and the social ills that were being caused by their greed for increasing profitability (\u201cThe Gilded Age | Texas Gateway\u201d, 2019)."
"The first time I considered joining the military is my father he is my inspiration, my idol, when i was a little boy i see him together with his company carrying their rifles and with their snappy suits think of wearing it also and with their stories like shooting front line with the enemies or under the forest patrol thinking it so much fun,and now i considered my self one of them says \u201d its hard to be a soldier serving the country even without food, shelter and away from your families and friends, now i know how does it feels to be my father."
"There are many types of clean, efficient, renewable energy sources. There are many energy sources that the earth has provided for us that we need to take advantage of. We need to build more wind turbines, hydro electric plants, and solar power plants. Another way of producing clean energy include using fission through nuclear power to create a clean renewable energy source. Government can also be doing there part by funding research about global warming and raising awareness about how individuals can be doing there part to reduce pollution. In conclusion, Global warming is a very serious thing, it can affect the orld in many different ways. We just need to decide which effects help or harm the world the most and then make an educated choice as to which ones the earth can handle while taking the least amount of stress, and having the best long term effect. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Patrick Michaels, \u201cThe Satanic Gasses\u201d Henry Willis, \u201cEarths Future Climate\u201d Fred Singer, \u201cHot Talk and Cold Science\u201d Ronald Bailey, \u201cGlobal Warming and Other Eco Myths\u201d"
"A neonate (from Latin, neonatus) is a baby who is 4 weeks old or younger also called a new born. The term applies to premature, mature and postmature infants. The neonatal period is the first 4 weeks of a child\u2019s life and it is a time when changes are very rapid. During these first 4 weeks of life,the child is at highest risk of dying. It is therefore crucial that appropriate feeding and care are provided during this period, both to improve the child\u2019s chances of survival and to lay foundations for a healthy life."
"Critics such as Attorney General Eric H. Holder and Semon Frank Thompson believe the death penalty is a failed policy and the risk of putting someone innocent to death is far worse. They also believe the death penalty doesn\u2019t act as a deterrent but instead acts as a way out for criminals. Eric H. Holder was a former attorney general of the United States from 2009 to 2015 (Eric), and Semon Frank Thompson was the former Superintendent of the Oregon State Penitentiary who executed 2 men, which changed his thoughts on the death penalty. These two men are just a small fraction of credible people who don\u2019t support the death penalty (Top)."
"Ace of spades is the highest valued card in the deck but from the 15th century on, the Ace of spades is the lowest valued card. Around 1860, the Ace was displaced as the highest card in some games as the Joker came into being. In German words \u201cJoker\u201d is called as \u201cJucker \u201c."
"We welcomed the new arrival, along with all the uncertainty he came with Would I be a good morn? Would Andy be a good dad? Neither of us had any children; neither of us knew what we were getting ourselves into. 1 With 9 months to prepare, many visits to the obgyn and a lot of constant research I was confident and ready to overcome this challenge. Ready or not, here he came! At approximately 2 am."

"The third strength is a strength that the mother pointed out to me. She had mentioned that the family\u2019s communication is their best strength. The communication between each other keeps things running smooth. Whenever something occurs, such as running late, they can call another family member and they will be there to help. The family also talks about what they are feeling and how they could make things better. This is a major strength because, without communication, the family would not continue to grow in a positive direction. Communication is the key to any successful relationship."
"Most of Curley\u2019s appearances are in the bunk house, which is described as, \u201cwhitewashed,\u201d and, \u201cunpainted.\u201d The dismal setting portrays how bleak the lives of the itinerant workers are, and the fact that Curley goes here to pick a fight just proves his inferiority complex. He has to pick on the weak in society to make himself feel better. Another thing to note in Steinbeck\u2019s presentation of the bunkhouse is that there were, \u201csmall, square windows."
"The realization of one\u2019s gender helps to allow us to fit into society better. A man, for example, would hardly be seen walking into a restaurant wearing a dress. He would carry him in a certain manner, speak in a particular way and certainly would not cover his face running from the restaurant crying if his girlfriend dumped him. If he displayed these characteristics, his family and friends for behaving \u201cfeminine\u201d would ridicule him. Acknowledging our gender helps to create our social identities, this involves dressing, behaviour and even movements. It would look very strange to see a man walking with swaying hips. Knowing one\u2019s gender is important to becoming socially accepted."
"In the society that we are immersed in today, a lot of very demeaning acts unfortunately become glorified by the media. Famous people all around the world, particularly the United States, have made a name for themselves because of what they have done. A lot of these said \u201ccool\u201d things they do involve illegal substances, alcohol, and sexually degrading gestures. Whether we like it or not, the world around us influences our decision making processes, and it has gotten to the point where it is almost believed to be \u201csocially unacceptable\u201d not to do them!"
"I am the oldest boy in my family, including cousins and siblings. Being the oldest boy, of four siblings and nine cousins, has had a huge impact on who I am. Considering both my parents are hard working, busy people, I have spent a significant amount of time caring and setting an example for my siblings. Thankfully my older sister Danielle, who was a peer leader, was always motivating me. While she set a phenomenal example, most of the time, I was also able to learn from her few mistakes."
"The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reported on intimate partner violence, which also included rape and sexual assault, and stalking. The report includes an estimate of the extent of crimes against females and the characteristics of crimes and victims. In 2008, females age 12 or older were five times more likely than males age 12 or older to be victims of intimate partner violence. In 2007, intimate partners committed 14% of all homicides in the U.S. The total estimated number of intimate partner homicide victims in 2007 was 2,340, including 1,640 females and 700 males. Females made up 70% of victims killed by an intimate partner in 2007, a proportion that has changed very little since 1993."
"Charles Keeling, an American scientist, conducted a study wherein he recorded the amount of carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, to study plant conditions. According to his data, the total amount of carbon dioxide increased yearly; the earth is getting warmer and warmer due to the abundance of these gases in the air. (See figure 1.)"
"Words are not simply enough to describe my admiration and my love for my father. Despite the odds stacked against him, he was able to emerge triumphant through his hard work and successfully raise a family. This is the reason why he has made such a significant impact in my life. My father showed me the value of getting a good education and also taught me that there isn\u2019t a single thing I could not achieve in life if I put my mind and my heart to it. Furthermore, he set a wonderful example to me and my siblings by being selfless and sacrificing for the sake of others."
"It can therefore be argued that Hamlet\u2019s death is neither heroic, nor shameful, as although he eventually avenged his father\u2019s death as he had intended, many unnecessary sacrifices had been made due to his delay of choice. In terms of the natural order, although all those who had committed crimes were punished in their deaths, the deaths of innocents like Ophelia emphasises the idea that justice cannot be served only by the punishment of the guilty, and if other moral implications are not taken into account, the natural order cannot be truly balanced."
"Promotion: This is an important aspect of a businesses marketing strategy. It will allow me to present the right image, what the business offers and to show the consumers that my business is competitively better. It will also promote the business as a reputable, recognised name and strengthen its position in the market. There are two types of promotion: above the line and below the line. Above the line is more costly and you have less direct control, but it is more effective, reaches a larger consumer audience and includes such methods as radio, television and newspapers. While below the line promotion is less expensive, you have more direct control over the area you wish to promote to, and it includes fliers and direct mail advertising. I have decided that it would be beneficial to use elements of both types of promotion. I will place weekly adds in the Belfast Telegraph, have a small advertisement on the local radio station \u2018Cool FM\u2019 as well as distributing fliers through out Glengormley."
"Maintaining confidentiality and integrity may be difficult when working in child protection, as parents may be aggressive and at times physically abusive, to not only the child, but the practitioner too. However, it is thought that by adhering to the values and principles of social work practitioners will be able to create a sense of shared identity and values amongst other care settings. It should also allow the clients to gain knowledge and understanding on what to expect and how their involvement within care settings will be handled."
"The Lord of the Flies comes from the Arabic for \u201cBeelzebub\u201d, a demon associated with Satan directly when the boys kill Simon, something the Lord of the Flies threatens to do and that he will get \u201cwaxy\u201d and \u201cdo\u201d him, in the language of the boys proving the boys are the Lord of the Flies and are evil. When they kill Simon, they do so in an animalistic way as there are \u201cno words and no movement but the tearing of teeth and claws\u201d further proving Golding\u2019s despairing vision of humans. Furthermore, in the book of Revelation, the beast comes \u201cout of the sea\u201d from \u201cfrom the abyss\u201d linking to chapter five\u2019s title \u201cBeast from Water\u201d, the naval warship, a reminder of the evil British empire as the officer\u2019s uniform displays the \u201ccrown, an anchor\u201d representing the imperialism that the Queen, the Navy and the Army are responsible."
"During the war Lincoln and Lee talked some about trying to end the war peacefully. The confederate troops after 4-years of fighting finally agreed to surrender. Lee was able to convince his soldiers that life was more important than fighting for money and slaves. Only Lee\u2019s most trusted soldiers and generals obeyed and took his wisdom. He said, \u201cWe must forget this war in order to pursue God\u2019s plan for America\u201d. General Lee was considered the greatest leader of the Civil War. Everyone even those on different sides, honored him as a general, as a person, and as a follower of Christ."
"Language, speech and communication skills are very vital for promoting other areas of learning. A child\u2019s with communication difficulties, their overall development will be affected. The impacts of child\u2019s language and communication difficulties vary depending on the individual needs of the child along with the severity of these difficulties. The following areas could be adversely affected."
"They have lost their identities as human beings in the process, due to being treated as animals. Late in the novel, we have the passage \u2018Remembering seemed unwise\u2019 (Morrison, 137), and indeed to read this novel is to confront a historical past, to be forced to think about traumatic national stories and the ways they continue to live in the present. It is a story with a burden."
"Furthermore, an interesting and somewhat problematic issue about the language used in the novel is, that the language is not authentic. \u201cIt is not spoken in any part of the Caribbean, it is rather a blend of various different variations and dialects spoken throughout the Caribbean\u201d (Bentley). One of the reasons why Selvon did not usefully Creolized English is quite obvious. He wanted even the speakers of Standard English to be able to read his novel. By using this form of artificial Creole, he managed to accomplish both goals: to make the novel accessible to as many readers as possible but also to use it as a token of distance from the British mainstream culture. Moving ahead, one of the first settings of the novel, the railway station, where many black immigrants are present, either waiting for some relatives or just looking whether someone they know from home arrived, a comment on the situation in Britain appears: \u201cEnglish people starting to make rab about how too much West Indians coming to the country\u201d (Selvon 2). Black immigrants know that they are not welcomed, that white people do not want them in Britain, and that they cannot expect any kind of friendly behavior from them. However, what is quite ironic is the conclusion the black immigrants themselves make. The novel was written in 1956, before any new Commonwealth Immigrants Act was passed and there is a mention that British people complain, however, they are too diplomatic to actually do something about it. Nevertheless, the immigrants were wrong in this respect and only six years later, the new restrictions were introduced. Tanty who just arrives in Britain and does not know about the grudge against the black immigrants has an interview with a white reporter and the next day in the newspaper her picture appears with a headline \u201cNow, Jamaican Families Come to Britain\u201d (Selvon 12). Her nephew Tolroy did not want her to speak to the reporter and he would not speak to him at all because he is already familiar with the atmosphere in Britain. Moreover, even if he wanted to tell him something, like Moses who wanted to take a chance and express himself, he would find out that the newspaperman actually does not care about his opinion. Comments and situations like this appear throughout the novel. Immigrants are less likely to get jobs or they are only hired for unskilled jobs. Because the immigrants fight for every penny, they live in overcrowded second-rate houses. The immigrants acquiesce with the situation as is visible from the episode when Moses tells Galahad that no matter that he is a skilled electrician, he will probably be offered an unskilled job. Moses tries to explain this issue to Galahad who is a newcomer to London:"
"In conclusion, Debate about the use of the death penalty for juveniles has grown more intense over the years considering the demand for harsher punishment of serious and violent juvenile offenders, altering insights of public safety, and worldwide challenges to the death penalty\u2019s legality would help diminish this act and save our youth. Advocates see its use as a preventive against similar crimes, a suitable authorization for the command of certain serious crimes, and a way to maintain public safety by putting these juveniles away. Adversaries believe that it is a deterrent and is inherently cruel and point to the risk of wrongful conviction. \u201cThe constitutionality of the juvenile death penalty has been the subject of intense national debate in the last decade. Several Supreme Court decisions and high-profile cases have led to increased public interest and closer examination of the issues by academics, legislators, and policymakers (Node, 92)."
"The value of friendship is exceptionally significant in human psychological development. We all live under pressure of time, problems, hurdles, emotional crises. Talking to someone you trust is the most essential influence on our health because stress should be relieved from time to time. Sincere conversation with your companion is the most significant cure for any depression."
"The workers on the ranch describe crooks as a \u201d nigger \u201d one second and the other second they be saying he is a \u201d very nice fella \u201c. I think my self that crooks is a very good person and stays quiet throught the book but it is just because of the colour of hes skin he is treated like dirt. Even thought crooks is proberly the most educated person on the farm. Crooks has got a dictionary which is described as \u201d battered\u201d and \u201d ripped \u201cand hes also got some \u201d tatered \u201d magazines. Also crooks has got some reading books, which are described, as \u201d dirty \u201c. And all of these things go on a special shelf over hes bunk. When crooks read these books he feels \u201d proud \u201d and really \u201d important \u201d because at this time not much people could read or write. And on top of all that hes a \u201d nigger \u201c."
"Not only is animal testing morally incorrect, but it is also not the most effective method to conduct research on products to be used by humans. In fact, 92 percent of experimental drugs that are safe and effective in animals fail to tell us that they are too dangerous or ineffective on humans. (Do Something) When conducting an experiment for safety and efficacy on animals, the purpose is to try the product on a living system before exposing it to a human. But the complicated living system of a human being barely compares to that of a helpless small animal. For example Aspirin and chocolate are harmful to cats and dogs while they remain completely unharmful to humans."
"The Naturalization process is a difficult process to complete regardless. As an American citizen I feel that because of our strenuous program of becoming a citizen of the United States we are sifting through all the immigrants that are potentially hazardous to American society. If you make the process of Naturalization any easier you will allow dangerous criminals to slip through the cracks and therefore gain American rights and we then have to treat these immigrant criminals under American law. I can confidently say that with having a strict Naturalization process it fully benefits U.S. citizens and if any crimes are committed as you are a illegal alien you are then deported from the U.S. The future of the United States is todays immigrants. They have hopes and dreams for their families just like those of families that migrated here generations ago."

"Abigail was a map maker of dreams and shades. She is said to be more shade than her female parent. She likes landscape and Markss and finds them interesting. Reading maps was her favourite thing. At one point, during her expatriate in London, she gets possessed with the memories of her female parent, Chinese poesy, old maps and her childhood rites, lies across an old crinkly map as if she was a cadaver in a offense scene, transforming her organic structure to the contours of states and rivers, each landmark taking on a deeper significance. She decides to tag her organic structure for good with fire. She ab initio loses her virginity to one of her cousins, Edwin, at 10 before her male parent sends her off to London with another cousin, Peter, in the name of matrimony at 15. Peter is seemingly believed to be a outstanding concern adult male in London and Abigail \u2018s male parent believes that he is a well-mannered adult male, good plenty to take attention of his girl. Unknown to Abigail \u2018s male parent, Peter is malevolent and dehumanising. Fakes her paperss and attempts to turn her into a cocotte, but when she declines, he ties her up in handlocks in a kennel, violates her sexually, urinates on her and beats her every bit good. Peter \u2018s adulteration of Abigail portrays crud and hungriness. Drinking from the home base of rancid H2O and holding to flex over like a Canis familiaris is upseting."
"The process of going through the process can take time \u201cThere is a vast amount of time spent gathering evidence like police reports, eyewitness testimonies and any other information pertinent to the case. As a result, criminal lawyers utilize the expertise of paralegals, private investigators, litigation consultants and others to assist them\u201d. As far as the salary for criminal lawyers \u201cThe average salary of a criminal lawyer is $78,500. However, the salary can range from $45,000 to $130,000. Interestingly, private criminal lawyers make the lowest earnings among lawyers. Experience and rising to the top of the career ladder however increases a criminal lawyer\u2019s pay scale\u201d so getting your business put out would be a main priority so that you could make more money."
"Our household is not dependent on me for an income, so there would be time to build up a practice of clients without the stress of a delinquent income. I am further intrigued by the autonomy, flexibility, and economic self-determination aspects of private practice. In conclusion, this paper has demonstrated the concept of professional identity as it relates to MHC and why it is important to its future. It also has discussed the key characteristics and personality traits of a successful counselor and what duties and functions they may perform. Lastly, it evaluated the private practice setting as a work environment and how I think would be suited for it from a business perspective."
"Good evening my names Charli Paine and welcome to Media Watch, tonight we will be discussing the issue of dumb dads in the media. Have you noticed an increase in ads featuring dads?\u00a0 While some ads kindly show the real bond and father figure they are, for example the\u00a0Nissan\u2019s 2015 Super Bowl commercial, many others cast dads as fumbling idiots who desperately need to be saved from their stupidity by their children, spouses, or anyone else with an ounce of common sense."
"That is, in general, the picture of contemporary reality in the context of the problem of illegal immigration, our point of view on its causes, solutions and alternatives to the status quo. Thus, taking into account all the information discussed above it is possible to come to the conclusion that illegal immigration is a crime, but illegal immigrants need help and only right laws can help them to leave shadow and become visible. However, it does not mean that we should turn away from the current needs of this part of the social order, but on the contrary, we must look closely at the trends within it. I strongly believe that the answer must be found in the socio-political movement of the order itself, which we consider."
"Moreover, cultural shock was the other problem I had to face. Many immigrants face this problem as soon as they arrive. The cultural differences have a huge impact and impression on people as many aspects are foreign to them. Adapting to new cultures is arduous as during the process you tend to leave your own culture behind. Indian culture is more traditional, whereas Canadian culture is more open and advanced. For instance, In Canada, it is more acceptable for girls to beat the heat by wearing short clothes such as tank tops and denim shorts. In India, such clothes are considered taboo. Likewise, culture shock had a great impact on me. Moreover, as a student, I had to adapt to a whole new education system and this impacts me both physically and mentally. So, to cope up with it I tried to introduce myself to cultural events and activities which are part of the culture. I joined the culture club in my school as they opened the doors to many different cultures from all around the world. Cultural events like Christmas, Halloween and Thanksgiving and their history was celebrated. And I too was to represent my culture using the same platform. I also joined the dance classes to learn new forms of dance. Therefore, all these events made me more comfortable towards the new culture rather than making me into an outcast."
"Sharlene calls her home town \u201cthe land of sheer boredom\u201d because there is nothing much going on in it. The town is not very active and there is nothing much people can do. In order for Sharlene to become a CBC news reporter, she has to step into an environment that has much more to offer than Grassbank. Also, she needs to become more active, which she cannot by living in Grassbank. Similarly, Annie John lives in an environment which is blocking her way to more freedom and she is struggling within herself to break the wall and get her freedom. \u201cI never wanted to lie in bed and hear her get dressed, washing her face, brushing her teeth, and gargling. I especially never wanted\u2026.gargling again.\u201d(Pg 87) This quote shows that the environment Annie John is living in is small and she wants to get out of it soon. She does not like the sounds of her mother washing her face, brushing, getting dressed and gargling in the morning. Both protagonists have to face the environment they are living in, in order to become independent."
"10. Young children and adolescents can respond differently to divorce, December 19, 2011 by Carl E. Pickhardt, Ph.D. in Surviving (Your Child\u2019s) Adolescence Paraphrase: A divorce introduces a massive change into a life of a boy or girl no matter what age. When parent\u2019s divorce that to a child is witnessing loss of love between parents, having parents break their marriage commitment, adjusting to going back and forth between two different households and their rules, and the daily absence of one parent while living with the other, all create a new challenging family circumstance in which to live which makes it hard on a child. Basically divorce tends to intensify the child\u2019s dependence and it tends to accelerate the adolescent\u2019s independence; it often elicits a more regressive response in the child and a more aggressive response when the child is in its adolescent stage. The child is always the dependent one, closely connected to parents who are favored companions, and really reliant on parental care. The adolescent world is a more independent one, more separated and distant from parents, more self-sufficient, where friends are their favored companion, and where their major focus of their social life now extends outside of family into a larger world of life experience. For a young child divorce shakes their trust in dependency on parents who now have become extremely undependable. They will divide the family up by \u201cmommy\u2019s and daddy\u2019s\u201d side. For a while creating unfamiliarity, instability, and insecurity, never being able to be with one parent without having to be apart from the other parent. Summary: A divorce on a child is the hardest thing they\u2019ll ever have to go through. Divorce will make a child insecure, and confused. A child will normally put the divorce on themselves as it was their fault. It will intensify the child\u2019s dependence on the parents. When divorce occurs in adolescent years it tends to accelerate independence, but also elicits a more aggressive response. When the child is younger they depend on their parents, but when the child is in its adolescent stage they are independent, they are more separated and distant from their parents, and more self-sufficient, where their friends will become their favored companion, where in a child their"
"In the novel, Of Mice and Men Steinbeck uses Crooks character to show how discrimination was for a black man in the 1930\u2019s. An example of discrimination is in chapter 4, when Lennie comes into Crooks\u2019 room and Crooks says, \u201c They play cards in there, but I can\u2019t play because I\u2019m black."
"Animated spokes-characters are created to represent products in television advertising and some of these animated spokes-characters are already familiar with children because of the use of them in carious television programs. Several studies indicate that young children are affected by television commercials and the use of animated characters in three areas; character and product recognition, a high level of attention towards the commercial and a high degree of product liking. But the use of animated characters in commercials does not necessarily lead to brand or product preference or intention to choose the product over other products."
"The short passage extracted from the section \u201c\u201dThanikama\u201d\u201d in the memoir Running in the Family written by Michael Ondaatje depicts a dark scene where the author\u2019s father, Mervyn, is left alone near the end of the book. The scene is described in extreme detail to portray a clear mental picture of the atmosphere and setting, yet sparkled with figures of speech and other writing devices of which this paper is aiming to will focus on."
"In my view, nationalism is not a new phenomenon. In the majority of my arguments in this paper, the afore-going statement functions as my point of departure as I mainly disagree with the majority of Anderson\u2019s positions on nationalism. While I agree that nations in many cases are pictured communities, this is not a fundamental quality of nations, and neither are countries always sovereign, though they may be limited geographically. I posit that republicanism, rather than \u2018print capitalism\u2019, is the dad of modern-day nations however at the exact same time, that countries are not products of modernity."
"In present day America, dating violence among teens has been a significant problem. Investigation of any factors that may play a part in the acceptance of the use of such violence would surely seem justified. The negative treatment and portrayals of black women in rap videos and lyrics could be a possible factor. Despite the fact, that social researchers have started to study the potential negative impacts of the lyrics and videos of rock music. However, the negative effects to the exposure of rap music has been overlooked (Hansen & Hansen, 2004). Considering that rap music has received a substantial amount of criticism and scrutiny by the media, it has been lacking empirical focus. It is believed that rap music may impact the attitudes and behaviors associated with the use of dating violence. This includes physical violence against young black women. A major criticism is that rap music is ingrained by men assumptions of women being objects of their sexual satisfaction (St. Lawrence & Joyner, 2006)."
"However, they also found that multifamily educational support groups led by experienced diabetes nurses also resulted in improvements in metabolic control among adolescents who were in poor control at baseline. Challenge in maintaining a therapeutic relationship with the teenager patient due to lack of exposure and their age I researched on evidence-based literatures to gain some insight into overcoming challenge in maintaining a therapeutic relationship with the adolescent patient. I didn\u2019t have any exposure with this patient group."
"In the twenties and thirties are often thought of as early adulthood. It is a time when we are at our physiological peak but are most at risk for involvement in violent crimes and substance abuse. It is a time of focusing on the future and putting a lot of energy into making choices that will help one earn the status of a full adult in the eyes of others. Love and work are primary concerns at this stage of life. This is the stage where we should be earnest in the decision that we are making. Since its still about ourselves, and involve our personal life as a human being (Hood, n.p.). It is important to take some of the things too serious because in this stage if we take things for granted the consequence that will be facing are a lot harder and it will surely affect our entire life. That\u2019s why it is very important to be too serious in the decision that we are making in this stage."
"\u2013 how about the one that was financially exploited by a family member or most recently here locally patients in a long-term care facility are being victimized by staff members. Fact: According to the Tennessee Commission on Aging and Disability (Tennessee.gov), in 2012- 2,032 cases of elder abuse were reported. Fact: only 1 in 23 cases of elder abuse are reported."
"By playing with the emotions of the audience we are led to feel sorrow for Julie\u2019s situation and the fact she is of mixed race seems completely irrelevant, as no one should be treated in such a manner. This is the message Kern and Hammerstein were trying to get across to white viewers, they were trying to change how they had an opinion of black or mixed-race people."
"Corporal punishment can result in lifelong psychological damages that are irreversible. When a child is punished physically, it installs fear rather than getting the intended message across. It sends out the message of aggression and when the children reach adulthood, this will have a significant effect on their psychological health. As a result, children might feel unloved, worthless and also useless. When this happens for an extended period of time, children may grow up believing that physical aggression is accepted in social circumstances. According to Vygotsky (1978), \u201ccorporal punishments may legitimize violence for children in interpersonal relationships because they tend to internalise the social relations they experience.\u201d This teaches children that violence is the solution for problems. Bandura (1969) believed that physical punishment allowed children to learn aggressive behavior through modeling. Children may continue this thinking into adulthood, causing them to hit their children to inflict pain and to influence other people\u2019s action. What adults are trying to prevent through physically punishing, they are reinforcing it unintentionally."
"The death penalty is asked to be given without aim or purpose at random: The three determining factors in death penalty case where crime is committed are the politics, jurisdiction and the quality of legal counsel. The death penalty is considered as a lethal lottery. Out of 22,000 people who commit crime every year, approximately 150 people are put to death."
"A child who has had failure to thrive may suffer from mockery, jokes and ridicule for their smaller size, they may be much slower intelligently than their peers, and can have a very difficult time making friends. (Benjamin, Reda, & Bassali, 2005) There are numerous factors that may contribute to a failure to thrive diagnosis, so a child\u2019s treatment is mostly based on the child\u2019s age, overall health, and medical history, there extent of child\u2019s symptoms, the cause of the condition, the child\u2019s tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or therapies and expectations for the course of the condition. If there is an underlying physical cause, correcting that problem may reverse the condition. The doctor will recommend high-calorie foods. More severe cases may involve tube feedings, which can take place at home. A child with extreme failure to thrive may need hospitalization, during which he or she can be fed and monitored continuously. (Slater & G, 2002, pp. 84) Failure to thrive occurs because of social, emotional, economic, and interpersonal problems."
"Thus, the need to control migration is also justified, if not necessary. At the same time, the persistence of ethnicity or culture as a bias still persists despite the establishment of political institutions that are to protect social diversity. The reality is that the issue is not so much regarding migration but the lack of viable opportunities and the inequitable distribution of wealth within nations and internationally."
"Both SARS and Covid-19 originated from China. It is said that the coronavirus is passed from bats to people and when one person has it, they can give the virus to two or three other people. For SARS, if you compare it to COVID-19, it had a much higher fatality rate. It\u2019s about 10 per cent."
"Having exceptional counselors, trained teachers, and excellent academic and financial tools helped me overcome my hardships and achieve my goals. All students deserve to have a similar fighting chance for a brighter future. They do not need to have luxurious campuses nor division one sports teams, but they do need a genuinely caring administrative team and effective curriculums. However, until such systems are reinforced, it is up to each member of society to lend a helping hand and transform the unjust system of education, by mentoring one student at a time."
"Some abusers make it a requirement that you ask for permission anything you do, almost as if you are a child. The moment abusers fear the most is that losing control of you as their property. Last, but not least is intimidation. Most abusers believe that going the extra mile to induce fear in their victims by any means necessary will keep them from running, telling and even leaving. Sometimes they may bang things, throw things and even threaten the hurt their victim. (Turley 74). Now that they have done this the victim in their mind feels alone and believes they have no one to turn to. They feel stuck with no way out of such a toxic situation. Some feel they will never be normal again nor do they feel like they are mentally or emotionally strong enough to fight, leave or move on from this situation."
"Eden Robinson\u2019s best selling book, Son Of A Trickster, is an excellent read. It\u2019s very descriptive and intriguing. It definitely makes me want to keep reading. The main theme of this book is about aboriginal beliefs and how most people from aboriginal ancestry are portrayed through the eyes of white people. Although I believe that this book is an excellent read, I also believe that this book should have guidelines as to what age is appropriate to read this novel."
"While Bertier is in a confrontation with Coach Boone an over the shoulder close up shot is used. This shot establishes tension by the sober facial expressions and later a long shot shows hostile stance and posture. This scene shows how harsh and blunt prejudice is in Remember the Titans."
"Similarly, the speaker strongly utilizes statistical evidence to strengthen the credibility of his arguments. For instance, evidence on the number of countries where capital punishment is still legal, those that no longer use it and those that have abolished it as 28, 60 and 100 respectively. The evidence is credible because it is based on Amnesty International data, which is a credible source of information. Besides, the speaker uses the court\u2019s statistics from the State of California as evidence to back up his claims and enhance credibility. Additional information worth knowing about capital punishment in America includes the cost of executions, the average time spent in death row and the percentage of innocent individuals who end up executed."
"Optimism is key to humanity evolving whether that be in economics, careers, healthcare, services, or technology. Optimism promotes hope and ambition which in turn generates positive outcomes. Believing in one\u2019s self and believing it is possible is helps problems be solved successfully. Optimism is closely related to confidence. Thus, both of these combined can lead to successful, prosperous results in whatever you put your effort into. Optimists are also known for overcoming negative conditions as well. Some believe that optimists are oblivious to everything around them but optimists focus on everything around them. Optimists stay positive to deal with things around them in an effective way. They take time to find the appropriate alternative. Viewing situations in different positive angles can produce positive effects and positive solutions. Being optimistic includes staying positive, problem solving, thinking on a broad scale, being open to new horizons, believing in yourself, being hopeful, and being hardworking. These factors are essential when having a growth mindset, striving to succeed, and learning/continuing to be an optimist."
"Since the students would not respond to that way of learning, she quickly revised and reiterated her way of teaching by asking them, \u201cWhat is the verb in the following sentence, \u201cWe want to die.\u201d Since this was a relative way of thinking about things for the students, they responded quickly (Bruckheimer, 1995). The most interesting thing about the way she taught through diversity was that she related the information to their real-life circumstances. Taking the transdisciplinary approach, she was able to teach across the curriculum by integrating poetry and the history of where it originated (Bruckheimer, 1995)."
"The therapy that was chosen for the Grape family is a multisystem approach. A combination of CBFT and psycho education will be implemented. The Cognitive Behavioral Family Therapy is based on a reciprocal and cyclical paradigm and promotes self-talk to develop their own cognitions in regards to family expectations, individual roles within the family, and how these impact the behaviors in the family unit (Shulman, 2012). The CBFT can address the grief and loss associated with the unresolved grief and any grief associated with the sisters moving out of the home."
"But in the bigger ways, we are completely different than the older generations. We ha eve this thing called technology, and its changed the world forever In every way. My generation has many things I\u2019m not proud of. We\u2019re more greedy, selfish, and independent. I feel like the one thing that s operates us so greatly, is technology. We thrive off of it, and we The first thing I would consider \u201cwrong\u201d with my generation, Is we have hardly any am option in life."
"It is important to note that not all babies develop at the same rate and so not all babies may be sleeping through the night. Parents and careers are more able to understand the differences between their babies cry and hence babies begin to cry less. Due to babies beginning to understand the difference between night day babies will begin to sleep less and start to seam more alert. A baby may be able to lift and turn their heads and notice objects around them such as mobiles. Babies will start to show they recognize their careers and will smile more as a sign of this."
"Unfortunately, business as usual does not support this goal, but rather parents are often forced to make the choice between working and early education for their children. It seems counter intuitive that a low to middle income parents ability to work is so intrinsically correlated to their children\u2019s ability to go to school, if a parent works their family cannot afford early education options. This paper explores the important role early education plays in children\u2019s development, anchors early education as a justice issue and explores the political landscape to establish ways in which Missouri might choose to implement a more equitable option for children and their families."
"Imagine driving home from school to go put on your uniform to go to work. You are driving the posted speed limit, obeying all traffic laws, and you car is in perfect working condition. All of a sudden, flashing red and blue lights behind you and you\u2019re being pulled over. The officer treats you as a suspect right off the bat, smothering you with questions concerning what you\u2019re doing, where you\u2019re going; yet never really telling you why you\u2019ve been pulled over."
"Death penalty is 100% effective as deterrent to the criminal being executed; that killer would not be able to commit anymore crimes especially homicide (Stephen K 1985). Suppose life imprisonment is the maximum penalty in a state, nothing can stop those prisoners who are facing life imprisonment to commit more crime especially murder again in prison. \u201cAssault in prisons in all over US, both against fellow inmates and against staff, have more than doubled in the past decades, according to statistics gathered by Criminal Justice Institute in Middletown, Connecticut\u201d(Van Paul 1998). Death penalty is a necessary evil that should be retained because criminal especially serial killers will learn a lesson which is death penalty is the most suitable punishment of justice for their extreme crime."
"Since before the time America became a nation and developed its own standards of living, racism has consumed the social environment and only gets worse as time progresses. Throughout the years, African Americans have been lynched and unfairly forced to work as slaves for white men on plantations. However, progress has been slowly made over the years. By 1870, the Reconstruction amendments were added to the Constitution. These amendments were crucial to the beginning of the end to the racial injustices Black Americans have faced."
"the author talked about Columbus, the Indians, and Human Progress, where he discussed the coming of Columbus when he first set foot to the continent and how the natives looked like during the pre-colonial age as he descriptively narrate the physical attributes of the natives, their appearances, their own customs before the colonizers, their means of living, moral standards and their geographical set up. It also made comparison from different conquistadors of American continent and how the natives fought against colonizers. The author were able to ask these questions:"
"The three scholar, in their articles \u201cRace,\u201d \u201cSlavery\u201d and \u201cwhite\u201d respectively share diverse views on race and how it should be understood in a different background setting like America. Ideally in America, during the 18th and 19th century presented theories suggesting that racial differences among people of different origins misrepresented the element of as a representation of biological differences in beauty, intellectual capacity and natural character between different races. On the contrary, it was heterogeneously a compound that included physical, intellectual and cultural characteristics that were genetically imprinted on each race."
"When the police officer strikes Biko, he immediately retaliates with violence, before explaining \u201cwe are just as weak as you are\u201d. These actions are very brave as the police were capable of murder and Biko may have been beaten to death. Quick cuts from Biko\u2019s frightened and anxious close up to the policeman\u2019s close up, his face enraged, emphasized Biko\u2019s danger. When Biko is on trial for breaching his banning order he is framed is a neutral angled mid shot and back lit with light falling on his shoulders and head suggesting he has been blessed by god."
"With this, Anderson is trying to imply that blacks are savages and those who listen to jazz will turn into savages as well. By the latter part of 1924, jazz had gained many white musicians and had also grown in popularity among the white crowd. The white population came to believe that notion that \u201c[\u2026] when white people play jazz, it is jazz music, but when black people play jazz, it is jungle noise\u201d (Anderson 144). So, in order to accept this, many critics came to the conclusion that white and black jazz were different and that white jazz was pleasing while black jazz tried to make music but only succeeded in producing noise. Critics played a huge role in dehumanizing jazz and the black population."
"To cope with our massive immigration problem which has produced the fastest population growth in the OECD, we are spending $15 billion per annum. Each year Australia must build the equivalent of a city the size of Geelong, with all its infrastructure and social services just to cope with one years immigration intake. Every migrant in Australia, must be provided with accommodation, food, transport, a job, schools, pensions, hospitals, water, electricity, roads, sewerage, universities and all the basic necessities of life. This has been a major factor in bankrupting Australia and has given us a foreign debt currently standing at $170 billion with a current account deficit of about $2 billion per month, half of which is due to immigration. It is no surprise that we have the highest per capita foreign debit in the world. Paul Keating was right, when he said in his maiden speech to parliament in 1970, \u201cIt is time we considered the enormous cost of bringing migrants to this country\u201d. Even the pro-immigration, Bureau of Immigration and Population Research, could not find any economic benefits from our immigration program \u2013 and their conclusion came from a study which was biased by omitting the enormous infrastructure costs mentioned above. Too few people recognise or question the corrosive influence internationalisation of our economy has had on our society and the part that immigration is playing in that process \u2013 the breakdown of unionism and consequent deterioration of awards/working conditions, the predatory nature of foreign investment/ownership, the destruction of manufacturing/dropping of tariffs and consequent unemployment/increased imports with associated increased foreign debt, the privatisation of publicly own schemes and dual citizenship. All of these contribute to our diminishing capacity to shape our national destiny as we are re-colonised by deregulated global capacity. Bipartisanship ensures these policies will further foreign take over towards a point of no return. If we can not stop immigration we will never stop the rest."
"Community service in its ideal form is a way of doing something positive for the community. I have had a personal experience recently in helping a group called the Butterfly Project at Moorpark College. This project is helping Palos Blue butterflies which were thought to be extinct for ten years but were recently found while constructing a new oil pipeline. Our English class was doing community service to help our essay and to have a better understanding of what community service is really about."
"Marriage is an important institution for individuals and society if it is the right time but if it is early it has a big problem. Marriage is a union between man and women. Early marriage is the common practice and largely in the South Asia area, especially in the developing countries. Early marriage is the way in which the one person of marrying couple is less than 18 years. Early marriage negatively affects the girls more than boys (Khanna, Verma andWeiss, 2011). The effects of early marriage can vary depending on the age of the individual and the culture, but early age marriage has a problem than benefits."
"Happiness is a combination of how satisfied you are with the life you live and how you feel on a day to day basis. When these two elements in life are stable, then you find true happiness. You have the ability to control how you feel and with consistent practice, you can form lifelong habits for a more satisfying and fulfilling life."
"Notice the use of the rule of three: \u201ccan not dedicate \u2026 can not consecrate \u2026 can not hallow\u201d. This is a powerful public speaking technique that can add power to words and make them memorable. This adds a punch to the delivery which makes sure the audience receives it and this too sparks an emotional response in the audience. It creates a sense of responsibility, that it is their duty to remember them."
"Civil society refers to a realm of autonomous groups, unions, associations, NGOs, interest groups, clubs, families, so on and so forth, that are private and organised in pursuit of their interest. Civil society by its very nature seeks to influence public policy or legislation but not to take government control."
"If they did not or could not, they brought shame to their husbands and families. The women at Oneida were not pressured about infertility because having children was completely optional. If the Oneida women decided to have children, they were not expected to be involved with child care. The Oneida children were raised together, apart from their parents. Noyes Robertson says that, \u201cThe children between two and twelve years of age were housed\u201d (311). This system allowed women to have children but did not force them to raise the child by themselves."
"Not everything is sunshine and rainbows it took many a long time to find that out, maybe it was the same for yourself. People from Places such as Syria, Yemen, Colombia, Nepal suffer in tremendous ways, whether it\u2019s natural disasters or racist police forces or bankruptcy. These are harmful to majors and other political personnel, but the adults and parents get the worst end of the billet. Telling kids the troubles that are happening in the world can cause improved communication, and appreciation of what you have and inspiration to come up with ideas to help fix the struggles people are going through."
"3. People have to stop impressing the others. People will stress if they are permanently striving to impress others with outer displays. People who are impressed with material wealth and social standing are probably the kind of people not worth impressing anyway. People have to be comfortable with what they have, not what they think will impress others."
"The Sister is outraged by this, \u2018therefore revenge became me well\u2019 and the writer creates madness here as it shows of the woman\u2019s uncontrollable desire to avenge her sister. Another huge difference in the poem compared to \u2018Porphyria\u2019s Lover\u2019 is the fact that this murder is premeditated and is done out of revenge. In \u2018Porphyria\u2019s Lover\u2019 there was no provocation aside from the Lover\u2019s necrophiliac tendencies. The fact that she spent \u2018Whole weeks and months, early and late\u2019 to get her revenge shows her obsession to get reprisal and her predator-like indignation for revenge. The phrase \u2018she lay in wait\u2019 brings to mind a lion about to strike its prey. This also craftily adds to the madness as it suggests of the Sister slowly turning into an animal with no rational thoughts."
"One of the most famous examples when it comes to the dangers of animal experimentation would have to be the Thalidomide tragedy of the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s. Thalidomide was a drug that came from the German market and was previously considered to be safe after it had been tested on thousands and thousands of animals. It was then marketed as a \u201cwonder drug,\u201d an amazing sedative for breastfeeding or pregnant mothers and it supposedly, \u201ccould cause no harm to either the mother or the child.\u201d"
"Appel, we should not only show tolerance to those who had abortion but joy that they have made a decision for their own and for the collective good. Considering the number of abortions that occur in the United States every year, it\u2019s impossible to imagine that 1. 5 million deaths of pre-born infants are for the collective good (Mathewes-Green 1). Furthermore, Appel goes on to declare that he dreams of the day when women will be walking around with pins and bumper stickers reading, \u201cThank me for having abortion when I wasn\u2019t ready to be a parent. Abortion is not a joyous matter; therefore, even the most irresponsible woman would not be proud of killing her baby. Even though some women are indifferent to having had an abortion, it\u2019s not something to be proud of. Therefore, abortion is not a wise choice nether for the mother or for the common good. There will probably never be a day when abortion becomes completely illegal, but it sure can be decreased if measures are taken to prevent unwanted pregnancies and assist women who slip through the cracks and get pregnant anyways (Mathewes-Green 1)."
"In the first stanza it appears that the author cannot, and will not, accept his mother\u2019s death. I feel that he is describing his mother as being like poplar trees. The phrase \u2018I see you walking down a lane among the poplars\u2019 makes me think that his mother had a tall, straight and slender figure, because that is what poplar trees are like."
"Before starting her classification Judith Viort describes her attitude to a classical type of friendship, the way she used to treat friendship: \u201cWomen are friends, I once would have said,\u2026\u201d then goes a classification with the help of imperative sentences: \u201cConvenience friends.\u201d Where she explains to the readers that we all have people whom we cross everywhere we go and that\u2019s why we have to communicate with them. \u201c Special-interest friends.\u201d \u2013 people who happened to visit the same places of interest that we do. \u201c Historical friends.\u201d \u2013 people who know us since our\u00a0childhood. \u201cCrossroads friends.\u201d \u2013 people who will be always our friends for those years, dramas and dreams they once shared. \u201cCross-generational friends.\u201d \u2013 friendship between people who are much older or younger than we are. \u201cPart-of-a-couple friends.\u201d \u2013 people whom we never see alone, they are always with someone. \u201cMen who are friends.\u201d \u2013 except friendship there is always some flirt. Considering this last type of friendship I agree with the statement that: \u201cthe sexual part, though small, is always some, it\u2019s always there when a man and a woman are friends.\u201d I think there can\u2019t be just friendship between a man and a woman, there is a part of flirt too. \u201cThere\u2019s always sex hiding away somewhere inside a friendly relationship between a man and a woman,\u201d said Lilian Rubin, a sociologist. \u201cA sexual undertone of friendship makes it especially attractive or even sensual. Relationship experts have said. \u201cThe belief that men and women can\u2019t be friends comes from another era in which women were at home and men were in the workplace, and the only way they could get together was for romance,\u201d explained Linda Sapadin, a psychologist in Valley Stream, New York."
"To understand the wrongness in killing us must be done in terms of what killing us does to us. Marquis states that killing us \u201cimposes on us the misfortune of premature death. That misfortune underlies the wrongness.\u201d Further, that when one is dead, one has been deprived of life due to the fact that premature death is a misfortune. Also, that premature death deprives an individual of a future of value. Thus, killing someone is wrong, in general, when it deprives that person a future like ours, which he calls a \u201cFLO.\u201d In Marquis\u2019 FLO theory are four arguments that support this account of the wrongness of killing."
"These stereotypes were disturbing, degrading and in most cases poor representations of black people. It saddens me how whites could think so low of black people or any other human being at all. Sadly stereotypes still exist today in television, media and society. One stereotype I feel definitely still exist today ids the Sambo stereotype although there are great black actors that play dramatic roles most black men in the media are still shown as being careless and immature."
"On Lennie\u2019s gravestone I will write \u201cTo my dear friend and companion 1905-1937\u201d. I promised Lennie\u2019s Aunt Clara that I would care for him. I looked after all Lennie\u2019s affairs, such as carrying his work card, and trying to steer him out of potential trouble. Now I feel completely alone, upset, lonely and lost. I don\u2019t know where to go. Now I think Lennie was everything in my world. It seems to me I miss him a lot. I couldn\u2019t keep Lennie\u2019s promise. I am sorry Lennie. Forgive me if you can."
"These presented concerns were followed by a purposed solution, which could have been implemented by the American Psychological Association (Williams, 2008). The proposed solution entailed seven positive provisions (Williams, 2008). First, to endorse the Kerner Commission\u2019s report on Civil disorders, which emphasized understanding injustices, inequality within the United States (Williams, 2008). Second, the American Psychological Association formulate an internal organizational structure to provide representation for the Black community (Williams, 2008). The recommended American Psychological Association develop policies to support the Black community and Black psychologists. Third, that the American Psychological Association provides resources to find solutions to racism and poverty (Williams, 2008). Fourth, that the American Psychological Association created a committee to observe the usage of standardized psychological instruments amongst Black youth, specifically understanding the effectiveness of instruments on diverse samples (Williams, 2008)."
"Within Little Rock, majority of the students had to transfer because of how much the violence was getting out of control. Another reason these historical stories are similar is because they both kept trying after many attempts to integrate these public places. Even though it was legal for them to attend these public places they were still treated very unfairly and still were segregated. Martin Luther King returned to Albany 4 times before these protests finally turned to violence, and the little rock students consistently attended their classes before things had gotten worse. In conclusion, both the \u201cLittle Rock Nine\u201d and the Albany Movement, had a significant effect on the history of civil rights in the African American Community. Both situations portrayed the amount frustration the African American community had. Even though they approached these life-risking situations peacefully it didn\u2019t matter if these protests were unsuccessful. These stories made history for their bravery and attempts and will forever be acknowledged for their efforts."
"All the sexual identity development models presented in your texts contain a biased assumption that the optimal outcome for such development is always a commitment to a lesbian/gay or bisexual identity. The lack of another healthy potential outcome reflects a clear ethic values judgment on many cultural groups. For example, this discriminates against people with strong monotheistic religious identities (Muslim, Christian, and Jewish) who may seek alternative identity development patterns which lead to identity and behavioral practices more in line with their faith."
"The effect of this is the total opposite of what she wants (of how they look at her as a tart) she doesn\u2019t want that, she wants to be respected by them. She wants to make something of herself \u201cwell I wasn\u2019t gonna stay no place where I couldn\u2019t get nowhere or make something of myself\u201d this ties up with the American Dream. This is great proof that the dream actually exists."
"The Aborigines had to cover with interlopers of whom they had no anterior cognition of. and the immensely different societies and civilizations of these two groups of people. As European colonisation began to settle down. Australia\u2019s Aborigines were seen as lower category and barbarian existences by the \u201csuperior\u201d Europeans ( Aboriginals Rights \u2013 EmbraceAustralia."
"PEACE Domestic Violence Agency\u2019s focus in this section would be to address the risk of domestic violence victims in the city of Portland and that it needs immediate assistance. This should be no more than a two-page section. Justify why PEACE should be funded. Include more than statistics to help support the details of this population area. The following are how describing target population: Describe the target environment such as the community, neighborhood, city, district, etc. Describe the population(s) to be served"
"Unbeknown to Danny, Derek is a changed man. Fresh from prison, he no longer views hatred as a badge of honor. Ashamed of his past he is now in a race to save Danny and the Vineyard family from the violence he brought down upon them. His mind is open and sees the\u00a0error of his ways. Upon reentering the real world, he must now turn his attentions to his younger brother Danny, who is swiftly heading down the same path as his brother. He tells Danny to listen to Avery Brooks the principal of the high school who has made Danny write a paper on Derek. He also tells Danny of the experience he had it jail and how it has changed\u00a0him. It is too late and in the end Danny is murdered in school one day by one of the younger brothers of whom Derek had murdered."
"Since his election, President Donald Trump has cracked down hard on immigration. \u201cHis executive orders expanded the authority of immigration officers and are expected to increase the detention and deportation of undocumented immigrants\u201d (Rahimi). ICE has made it very clear, that while, agents are looking for criminals, they will also rounding up any undocumented immigrants along the way. The agency even sent a series of tweets two weeks ago reminding young undocumented immigrants granted deportation protections under Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that they also could face deportation. As a result of this, innocent people from grandmas, teenagers, to fathers and mothers with no violent crimes in their background are being deported and separated from their loved ones. This is something they fear everyday of their lives. They have to go out into the real world and pray that they or that their loved ones won\u2019t be gone when they get back. Children are getting separated from parents without even being able to say goodbye. \u201cIn April of last year, when her mother dropped by federal immigration headquarters in Manhattan to complete some paperwork, 8-year-old Virginia Feliz became part of a growing tribe of American children who have lost a parent to deportation. Her mother, Berly, 47, who migrated to the United States illegally a decade ago, went to the immigration office on a routine visit to renew her work authorization. But because an old deportation order had resurfaced, she was quickly clapped into handcuffs, and within hours placed on a plane to her native Honduras, unable to say goodbye to her husband and little girl\u201d(Bernstein). As the Federal Government continues to separate families as part of the program, authorities state that parents are not supposed to deported without their children. Being separated from your family can be traumatic for the parents and children because they don\u2019t know when they will ever be able to see each other again. Often times, undocumented parents who get deported don\u2019t explain to their children what happened and why they aren\u2019t with them anymore, to keep them from knowing the harsh reality of deportation. This increases the feeling of abandonment, loneliness and anger as the children try to find reasons as to why they were left behind. Virginia Feliz\u2019s mother had done exactly that, and had told her daughter she had gone to Honduras to take care of a sick relative. Her daughter was angered and wanted answers as to why her mother left her. Still to this day, ICE is cold-heartedly ripping families apart without thinking about how this affects the children or the family."
"No community or society can exist and thrive without laws, which in turn means if there are no rules or laws established then the community itself with not flourish and eventually fail because there is no standard to which everyone is expected to live up to. So when someone disobeys those governing laws they should then lose their given right to be a part of that community or society."
"\u201cIn spite of the laws against racist behavior, people do continue to behave in racist ways to some extent. Frequently this behavior is unintentional and difficult to pinpoint. In other cases the behavior is intentional but cannot be detected and punished by law for various reasons\u201d (Garry, 2011). Stereotypes Stereotypes evolve out of fear of people from a minority group."
"The biomedical model also sits well with the functionalists approach to health and social care. Functionalists view illness as dysfunctional for society, as if people are ill they can\u2019t make their normal contributions to society and are exempt from their usual social responsibilities, effectively stopping it from running smoothly. They then have the responsibility to co-operate with health care professionals and should take all reasonable steps to get better."
"The sub-plot of Hayavadana is entirely different from Karnad\u2019s invention. In the play the stories of the sub-plot throughout supports the main plot. Hayavadana is an enigmatic play. Kirtinath Kurkkoti says, \u2018Karnad\u2019s play\u00a0poses a different problem, that of human identity in a world of tangled relationships\u2019 (Contemporary Indian Drama 53). Another critic U. R. Anantha Murthy in his A Note of Karnad\u2019s Hayavadana, comments about theme like incompleteness in a comic mode.\u2019 A few paragraphs later he says, \u2018The play tries to create an illusion in us that the head determines the being of man\u2019 (56)."
"5. 1. Summarise the expected stages of children\u2019s behaviour. Children need guidance and personal example from the adults around them to help them learn what is acceptable and what behaviour isn\u2019t acceptable. Behaviour is greatly influenced by primary socialisation and children will react and take in how close family members act. Bandura developed the modelling idea where children would copy the adults around them. \u201cThere is much evidence that a child who witnesses or experiences violence at home may develop aggressive tendencies."
"The subject of immigration in this country I\u2019m sure goes back to the days of the Declaration of Independence. I have read stories and been told stories (my grandparents) of Ellis Island and what it was like to come to this country. It is a contentious issue. I\u2019m not one to wade into the political waters especially since it is such a polarizing topic. I can only read and relate what I\u2019ve learned and what I\u2019ve heard."
"The Chinese settled mainly in the West, so they were not a major concern for Industry workers at that time (Most workers worked in the factors on the East, whereas the Chinese were on the West). However, when the New Immigrants came to the country, the Industry workers were furious. Especially with the formation of Labor Unions, these workers claimed that the New Immigrants were willing to take jobs with much less pay, therefore taking many of the current jobs occupied by the middle and lower classes."
"* The refusal to acknowledge intrinsically wrong acts: a judge might convict an innocent man in order to prevent a riot that would ensue if he were not convicted \u2013 a utilitarian would argue that this is permissible because more people would be made unhappy by the lack of a conviction and the riot; but is it intrinsically wrong to imprison or execute an innocent man?"
"Tocqueville goes on to explain that if slavery is not abolished within a short delay, it could take thousands of years before the \u2018perfect circumstances\u2019 arise. Moreover, the colonies are now being flooded with uncertainty because slaves want slavery abolished soon, which creates tension within the lives of slave-owners. They do not have certainty anymore on what they know to be theirs and they do not risk opening new enterprises if they will not reap the rewards. This lack of entrepreneurship cause by slavery can also be seen in \u2018Democracy in America\u2019 when Tocqueville explains how the states of the South are much less prolific than the state to the North even though they have slaves working for free in their enterprises."
"The Cakewalk was the first African American dance to gain widespread popularity in the United States. [pic] African American dance, like other aspects of African American culture, finds its earliest roots in the dances of the hundreds of African ethnic groups that made up African slaves in the Americas as well as influences from European sources in the United States. Dance in the African tradition, and thus in the tradition of slaves, was a part of both every day life and special occasions. Many of these traditions such as get down, ring shouts, and other elements of African body language survive as elements of modern dance."
"And for most mothers, a wonderful marriage life is what they desire for their beloved daughters. Since time immemorial, this desire has been the heartfelt and spoken wish of every mother. A daughter\u2019s great and beautiful marriage is a dream come true. For some mothers, marriage is a sanctuary; a source of security and happiness. In other cultures, new-born daughters are given into arranged marriage to ensure their future."
"To sum everything up, all I want to say is: the reason why I love disrespecting older people is because I care for them. I want them to become better individuals for themselves and for the people they are interacting with every day in their own personal lives. All that for the hope that someday, everyone would become aware of how they affect their community and see their mistakes and realize what they must do to become better citizens of this country."
"Thank God\u201d, it presents the gradual expansion of United States to the extent of waging war from Mexico which then became known as the Mexican-American War, that have driven with political aggression bombarded with its idea of \u201cmanifest destiny\u201d which again to conquer and expand. The war had provoked factional ideas and stands as to either go with it or not. Thus created again an opposing perception with a grasp of political and personal interest."
"Remember the Titans is more than a film about winning, it involves uniting the two black and white races so they come together and form a friendship, a bond like no other this is why for camp the players were taken to the battle of Gettysburg. During the camp coach Boone made the players take a 100 mile run to the burial grounds of the fallen soldiers. Boone says \u201cI don\u2019t care if you like each other right now, but you will respect each other. And maybe \u2013 I don\u2019t know, maybe we\u2019ll learn to play this game like men\u2026\u201d The\u00a0technique is the use of the dialogue and the interpretation of this quote means that no matter how much racial hate the players have for each other they must learn to respect each other and if they do they can win."
"Farmers were drawn from their fields and moved to cities to work in factories. Rural America was declining and giving way to the rise of urban America. Local general stores were replaced by large chain department stores such as Macy\u2019s. The era of urbanization increased the division between classes. The Wealthy lived in suburban mansions and the poor lived in dirty slums, many struggling to survive. Urbanization created mass waste production, and the decline in rural America. Any good that came out of post-Civil War urbanization, was overshadowed by the negative aspects of the time period."
"Further to this, the divide is exacerbated by exposure to world market forces that results from liberalisation. The financial crisis of 2007 which started in the USA caused the collapse of Northern Rock, RBS, and HBOS, major banks whose headquarters were based in Newcastle and Edinburgh. French et al (2010) argued that their fates signalled the end of Edinburgh and Newcastle as regional financial centres, thus further eroding the spatial equality of types of services in the UK. Indeed, Newcastle is increasingly being known as being a location of choice for outsourcing call centres (Richardson et al 2000)."
"Just like the other pictures, the poster offers us information about violence against women by the depiction of the woman, her injuries and the slogan and the picture is taken as a medium-shot. This difference of this motif is the oblique and slightly low angle which puts the woman in an elevated position, slightly looking down on the viewer. It is a subjective perspective because you can only see parts of her face and it puts the injuries in the focus to show that the relevant aspect is not the gorgeous woman. This motif is the only one showing the woman from this angle and with a minimal smile, so she looks militant. This angle presents the woman not as a victim, but as an affected person who courageously shows what happened to her in order to draw attention to the subject. This kind of presentation kes it clear that those affected should not be ashamed or keep silent. At the same time, the view slightly downwards, directly into the eyes of the observer, seems like a demand to stand up and to act side by side with her against violence against women."
"Not only has my motivation to enter the legal profession grown, but also my general qualifications. \u2018Through my FTFT service particularly, I have expanded my ability to communicate and advocate; have developed leadership skills and increased my awareness of the concerns of those around me. Since my specific volunteer period ended,"
"Throughout the novel Steinbeck presents the character of Curley\u2019s wife in a number of ways. Initially he tells us that she is a beautiful girl who is lonely and she is the only female on the ranch. Steinbeck explains that she is presented as a sexual object for Curly. Even though she is the boss\u2019s son\u2019s wife, she is still low in the hierarchy within the ranch. She clearly uses her sexuality as a weapon and is seen as a sexual predator. Curley\u2019s wife uses sexual power to get what she wants as a woman in the 1930\u2019s would have little economic or social power and even when as you find out toward the end of the book and the death of Curley\u2019s wife she only acts like this so she\u00a0can finally have the attention she is missing out on. Unfortunately her sexuality has no impact on the farm because everyone is scared of being friendly or seen with her due to her husband\u2019s power. She is flirtatious \u2018\u2018you guys seen Curly anywhere?\u2019\u2019"
"The article concluded with Jonah\u2019s team determining the iPad, with its specifically tailored apps, as a significant way to improve his literacy growth and communication skills. Personally, technology via iPads is an excellent way to build the skills of young students like Jonah, while allowing them more opportunities to interact with peers and to use the same technology as they grow. I can see students increasing their confidence and self-esteem by being more comfortable and expressive, as Jonah\u2019s parents stated, an iPad is socially acceptable. That would certainly make students with disabilities feel like they fit in with everyone both inside and outside of school."
"The emotional stress caused by unemployment while having attachments can also affect the things you do. For example, an individual who has a family with kids is going to be more emotionally involved since he must be a provider for his family. If an individual cannot provide an adequate amount of scarce resources for his family, more-so his children, said person is obviously going to be way more inclined to find away to make ends meet for his family, even if it means in a criminal manner. Unfortunately, there are some flow on affects for individuals in families being unemployed."
"Marriage should be a couple\u2019s dream,not a nightmare.It is based on a decision you entirely take with an individual you love,or at least that is how it is supposed to be.Love should be the main and only reason of the union of two people who share a real passion and are driven by their emotions.That said,marriage should be based on a free will. However,what if marriage is forced on young,innocent souls who do not even know the notion of life and how to cope with their situations?What if that marriage is destroying those young children and trapping them in a bubble of fear?These marriages take place for several,and irrational reasons that can drive a person to be in a really insane status and feel demented."
"Emily Bronte\u2019s only novel \u2018Wuthering Heights\u2019 is a prime example of gothic romanticism from a woman\u2019s point of view during this period of time, examining class, myth and gender. The book\u2019s core theme is the destructive effect of jealousy and vengefulness both on the jealous and vengeful people and as well as on their communities. This novel in particular has violence, passion, the supernatural, heightened emotion and emotional distance, an unusual mix for any novel but particularly at this time. Of \u2018Wuthering Heights\u2019 Dante Rossetti said that \u201cthe action is laid in hell, only it seems places and people have English names there.\u201d Of the three sisters Emily alone possessed the gift of poetry. Her verse includes a few pieces of rare excellence."
"Upon their return they saw the awful sight of their destroyed village and homes that they had put so much time and effort into building with each other. Americans saw the Indian society as run of the mill. They looked down upon the women and children especially. Indian women did not have much of a say in society or politics, either, but these determined women worked hard in the fight for their rights. A prime example of a Native American woman struggling through the difficulties of racial prejudice during the revolution is Nancy Ward."
"As a child, I went through frequent transitions starting at the age of five. I had studied at 10 different schools because my father was a government official; he had to move from one place to another within the diverse country of India. Growing up in a multicultural environment, I learned the art of connecting and adapting. I was quite fascinated by different cultures. As I grew older, my interest in learning technology, taking ownership, along with my love of multiculturism, paved the way for my overseas assignments in Germany."
"Mr. Ricardo started with first building a primary school known as St. Mary\u2019s primary school which he gave to private individuals to run later on. The second project he embraced was a church known as Madre Teresa church of which he had procured a 10-acre church which he donated to build a church and primary school. It was amid this time the late Bishop Luigi Locati passed on and subsequently, Mr."
"When the United States elected a black man as president, every individual was talking about a post-racial America, a period that would see a change in the racial boundaries set in the United States. The country felt good about having Barrack Obama as president and went ahead and re-elected him for another four years term. Barack\u2019s presidency was a profound moment and marked positive progress. Still, racism never ended, and having a black man as president never erased the racial injustices that the different communities of color had gone through in the previous century."
"The carnival setting is also the cause of mistaken identities. Because of this confusion Behn is able to further the comedic and suspense elements. For example, Don Pedro is denied his opportunity with the lovely Angellica when his friend (and his intended brother-in-law) Don Antonio pays his offering to be with her. Don Pedro is further incensed by the fact that this is a slight against his sister, Florinda, which ultimately leads to the setting of a time and place for a duel. Of course, Don Antonio believes he is confronting Belvile from his verbal exchange with Don Pedro. Ironically, when Belvile comes to the aid of Don Antonio later, he is charged with actually doing the crime of injuring him."
"In \u2018Of Mice and Men\u2019 it has two different visions of women in it the first is the male character view and the second is the novel\u2019s view of women. The male characters view on women which is they tend to view the women with fear and negatively labelling them as dangerous sexual temptresses. The male workers often referred to Curley\u2019s wife with insulting words like a \u201ctart\u201d (Steinbeck, 1965:31) and \u201cjail bait\u201d (Steinbeck, 1965:36). George and Lennie have a friend in prison \u201con account of a tart\u201d (Steinbeck, 1965:63) plus they have had their own troubles twice as a result from a woman. The first the women from Weeds and the second is Curley\u2019s wife. Although she plays into her role as sexy temptress throughout the novel until the last part of it where is a victim. Curley\u2019s wife craves the attention of the men on the ranch because she\u2019s desperately lonely so she flaunts her power over the men because she herself feels weak. There are a number of symbols within the novel that have different meanings these are George and Lennie\u2019s farm, the rabbits that Lennie keeps talking about, Candy\u2019s old dog and also Lennie\u2019s puppy."
"Wendell Phillips represents a few commendable figures of Europe that have been proclaimed as the best minds of the time through making use of hyperbole. In the beginning of the passage, he describes Napoleon as a guy whom the French discovered \u201cno language abundant enough to paint the fantastic captain of the nineteenth century."
"That is just crazy to me! Burns goes on to examine the first black regiment and the first federal draft call. In New York, a mostly Irish mob held an uprising over the draft. They were opposed to abolition because they feared blacks taking their jobs. It also made them angry that the draft favored the rich in that they could easily hire substitutes to take their place. Meanwhile, the uprising in New York was ended and the enlistment of the first blacks into the Union army had begun, this was a huge blow to the Confederacy. However, the blacks did not receive fair treatment, but they were key to the war. I am not surprised that black soldiers would fight without pay, but it was surprising that they declined it because it was not equal to the pay of the white soldiers. I like the pictures of the black soldiers."
"Another prominent racial collision amongst characters of different ethnic groups is between Officer Ryan and Cameron and Christine Thayer. In this scene Officer Ryan, the character played by Matt Dillon, sexually assaults Thandie Newton right in front of her husband. As viewers watch, they are overwhelmed with emotions of anger, disgust, and distrust towards Matt Dillion\u2019s character. Meanwhile viewers are also filled with emotions of outrage and confusion when Cameron Thayer, played by Terrence Howard, idly watches his own wife get sexually assaulted. Dillon\u2019s disgusting actions in this scene not only reinforce the ideology that all white male cops are \u201cslimy pricks;\u201d but also it reinforces another truth that minorities in Western society are powerless, especially against repressive state authorities like the police. Haggis is able to achieve this by having Matt Dillion\u2019s character dehumanize Christine Thayer. Ultimately, this reinforces that male Caucasians are more dominant than the African-American race."
"The story\u2019s ironic ending has a connection with the story\u2019s setting, imagery, and Chopin\u2019s use of similies. The setting has a major role to the ironic ending because it takes place in antembellum South where blacks are not treated equally to whites. There are several hints at where and when the story takes place. First, Armand\u2019s last name, Aubigny, was \u201cone of the oldest and proudest in Louisiana\u201d (Chopin 89) which tells us it takes place in Louisiana. Also, Chopin says that Armand owns a plantation and many slaves which wouldn\u2019t have been possible after the Civil War times showing that the story takes place during the antebellum period."
"Crooks is nicknamed as the \u201c******\u201d throughout the novel and this reflects the racially prejudice society of the USA in the 1930s. Crooks is also portrayed with sympathy, similarly to Curley\u2019s wife. But unlike Curley\u2019s wife, Crooks feels lonely because of the way he is segregated by the other men of the ranch. He does not sleep in the same bunk house as the other ranch men and is given his own room. He admits that he feels lonely and is left out by the other men because of his race, \u201ccause I\u2019m black."
"Legal and ethical issues have riddled criminal profiling since its existence. There is a committee called the Committee on Ethical Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists. These issues are not just about the offender. These ethical factors affect innocent individuals and hurt the criminal justice field as a whole. There are legal issues such as forensic fraud which is done by giving a sworn under oath statement or testimony which is false or misleading."
"Don\u2019t get me wrong, if legal abortion is banned, some abortions may be prevented. A woman may not be able to fund an alley-way, black market abortion and would have to deliver. This will be quite unfortunate. Naturally, Mother would be depressed, and in all actuality not deliver the proper care, may drink, do drugs, or any other thing she could do to harm the life of the baby and herself. Post delivery, the mother could very well resent the baby, realizing that it has trashed her chance of ever carrying out her objectives in life. If these women mandated into maternity do happen to keep their child, there is a significant chance of child abuse and neglect."
"In conclusion, the death penalty has been used since the 1970s, and depending on cases in the future, it will be used again. The main reasons that capital punishment is good for the legal system that criminals who should expect the death penalty are an unfair financial burden on the state, the death penalty is the only rational and moral response to some crimes, some crimes deserve the death penalty usually regarding the \u201ceye for an eye\u201d rule, and lastly, it makes the public not want to commit the same crime that some people get the death penalty. There were many cases that ended in death such as Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gays, Allen Lee Davis, and Duane Buck. There are more monsters in the history of the country that makes the point that capital punishment should be permitted, for these reasons the death penalty should be established in all 50 states in America. Without history in a subject, there is no future, it has shown that it works multiple times over multiple years. That and more reasons make me personally say that I am a pro-death penalty because it is effective."
"The norms and values that exist within social groups are maintained by processes that sociologists conceived of as social control. Again, social control goes on informally as well as formally. Informal processes range form the uncomplicated fact that is generally easier to get along in a social group if deviance from norms, in what has been regarded as both a profound and a trivial demonstration."

(\u201cNewsletter Center\u201d) The overall design of Authentic Happiness is professional or academic looking, especially because it is part of the online portal of the University of the Pennsylvania."
"Her misuse of her Christian tradition is brought to attention through the words of the Misfit: \u201c\u2018She would have been a good woman,\u2019 the Misfit said, \u2018if it had been somebody there to shoot her every minute of her life.'(O\u2019Connor 11)\u201d \u201cThe Death of Tommy Grimes\u201d is much more straightforward in its anti-traditionalist message, emphasizing its stance through the remarkably blunt words of the father: \u201c\u2018Boys, I wanna tell you my boy became a man today. Yessir, killed his first n****r.\u2019 (Meaddough 413)\u201d The child then belongs to their ironically infantile world of men, and is taken as one of their own by the bar\u2019s stereotypically racist Southerners. This message is condensed to fit the last page of the story, leaving the message short but also driving its point across in a way that is extremely hard to miss. For this reason, \u201cThe\u00a0Death of Tommy Grimes\u201d is the better of the two stories in terms of accomplishing its task. \u201cA Good Man is Hard to Find\u201d uses the characters of the children to show its views on tradition\u2019s dangerous effects as it is passed down and either mutilated or ignored throughout multiple generations."
"Prosecutors, on the other hand, do not agree with the trend, claiming the laws compromise public safety. Among them is Michele Hanisee, the president of the Association of Deputy District Attorneys for Los Angeles County. Hanisee said the fallout from the new law will come at the expense of innocent victims since murderers are being set free."
"I personally think that women are more capable of adding this tremendous value to a child\u2019s life. However, in the light of recent developments I would like to differ and cite the alternative point of view. The equations in today\u2019s world are changing and the women are actively seeking employment and pursuing very challenging careers. Though the idea of motherhood is very fascinating, the actual process of bringing up a child can be very demanding. And here is where the male\u2019s rational, organised and practical outlook counts. They can make it tick even in such a very demanding situation and hence men are capable of being better parents."

"The following week me and Billy came to the bathroom during lunch with our pockets overflowing with our most prized possessions. We sat down and each of use put down a five dollar bill. \u201cWe\u2019re ready Jeff.\u201d Billy smirked. \u201cAlright let\u2019s do this!\u201d Me and Billy had been practicing all weekend long and might I say we were masters already. We shredded through everyone. Jeff, Tony, Mark, Anthony, David, no one could stand a chance against me and Billy. After just one week of wiping the floor with all the boys in my class I had made thirty two dollars and twenty five cents. I came home from school on Friday and greeted my mother by jumping into her waiting arms. Without her knowing I slipped the money into her back pocket and the next week I was determined to bring home more money for my mom."
"The movement against capital punishment revived again between 1955 and 1972, after teh II World War and the publication of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the newly created United Nations. England and Canada completed exhaustive studies that were largely critical of the death penalty and these were widely circulated in the U.S. Death row criminals gave their own moving accounts of capital punishment in books and film. Convicted kidnapper Caryl Chessman published Cell 2455 Death Row and Trial by Ordeal. Barbara Graham\u2019s story was utilized in book and film with I Want to Live! after her execution. Television shows were broadcast on the death penalty. Hawaii and Alaska ended capital punishment in 1957, and Delaware did so the next year. Controversy over the death penalty gripped the nation forcing politicians to take sides. Delaware restored the death penalty in 1961. Michigan abolished capital punishment for treason in 1963. Voters in 1964 abolished the death penalty in Oregon. In 1965 Iowa, New York, West Virginia, and Vermont ended the death penalty. New Mexico abolished the death penalty in 1969. Trying to end capital punishment state-by-state was difficult at best, so people who wanted to get rid of the death penalty turned much of their efforts to the state courts."
"Charlotte Yonge \u201cthe clever woman of the family\u201d (1865) shows sympathy for the protagonist, Rachel desperate for an outlet for her energies and intelligence. Rachel\u2019s hubristic attempts at independent actions end in near \u2013 apocalyptic tragedy, however, when a child dies under her care the novel ends with Rachel\u2019s reform as she becomes engaged to a military man who promises to make her \u201ca thorough wife and mother\u201d and to whom she confesses that she was never a \u201cclever woman\u201d. After all, \u201cI never thought you one,\u201d he quietly returned."
"He was closer to death that time but luckily, Dalin went to him and saved him. Their journey starts which led by Dalin and Istak who are familiar with the road. They also met Blas and his daughters during the journey to Pangasinan. During their voyage, they\u2019ve been through a lot of challenges. One of Istak\u2019s relatives got killed because of the encounter of the Bagos. Ba-ac also died during the journey to Pangasinan because of the Python who waited and attacked him. When they reach the Agno River, an unexpected situation happened when Istak together with Mayang, his mother was crossing the river then suddenly a huge tree trunk hit the cart where Mayang was staying that caused Istak\u2019s mother\u2019s death."
"When we try to control it, it destroys us. When we try to imprison it, it enslaves us. When we try to understand it, it leaves us feeling lost and confused. Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up.Conclusion:With these, we therefore conclude that everything around us denotes love. Love for people, animals and things around us. We cannot survive without love. As GOD said, love one another as I have loved you. We can achieve anything as long as we put love into it. We should always remember that we must not own the ones we love. In love, you are possessing and you are being possessed by someone. You give each other the right to hold onto each other together.Here\u2019s a poem about love written by the three of us: THE GREATEST LOVEI.It is GOD, who gave us a gift,A gift that would always give us a lift,He taught us how to love,And how it is to be loved.II.Love is the greatest,When you are put into a test,It is hopeful and never gives up,Even if you feel the need to stop.III.Love endures everything,It should be together with praying,Between Faith, Hope and Love,The greatest of these is Love.IV.Love is a feeling that money can\u2019t buy,A mysterious feeling that makes you high,It makes us smile at times it makes us cry,But holding on together keeps the love alive."
"It is important to look at the way men grow up. When a boy is growing up he watches his father closely and mirrors his image and his mother\u2019s praise is very important. When a boy has to break away from his mother, they sometimes push femininity out of their lives. This commonly happens when boys grow up without a father. When this happens boys have issues dealing with their emotions, as men are typically told they are less of a man if they show emotion. As a result, boys fall into the trap of hyper-masculinity. This leads to a lifetime of struggle, anxiety, depression, and trouble with their identity (Diamond,2006). While Diamond makes it clear what this does to men, he does not mention how women are affected by their parents. Girls are often close with their mothers. Girls are taught to take care of household duties. Women are allowed to express their emotions openly. This allows for women to be able to deal with their issues, unlike men. However, women feel as if they are incapable of doing what men do. They often don\u2019t feel strong and feel as if they can not rise as high as men do. This hurts their self esteem and causes them to see themselves as weak and helpless."
"Dr. Perry (2017 pg. 250) states, the brain is organized from the bottom to the top part of the brain, the cortex being the most complex giving us the ability to be able to think, the lower regions of the brain gives us the central emotional areas in our brain which allows us to make social connections and controls our stress levels, and how the core part of the brain drives the response by itself. Brian development starts from the inner part of the brain moving outwards towards the cortex as the child develops. This information from Dr. Perry inspired the brain questions as it gives an insight to how Marie\u2019s brain from childhood experiences has shaped her overall , giving an insight on her thought processes in social and academic situations. As well, her emotional reactions and stressors when dealing with a variety of different temperaments."
"Organisations like your own have significant impacts on men emotionally and socially when they are experiencing domestic violence by failing to make them feel validated, supported and welcomed. Leaving them to feel as though they could not be victims. How could you possibly expect a man to reach out and receive support when you don\u2019t give them the same opportunities and resources that are given to women in the same positions? Men don\u2019t have as much access to support organisations as women do, including access to domestic violence shelters and helplines. When people have sought support through helplines, they have access to many sites including dvconnect\u2019. This site has helplines for both women and men. The \u2018womensline\u2019 is active for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, while the \u2018mensline\u2019 is inactive between midnight and 9 am each day."
"The Contribution of Sexual Roles and Status to the Incidents of Domestic Violence Domestic violence cannot be attributed to a single factor as various biological and personal factors determine the quality of relationship at homes. In most cases of domestic violence, the most consistent marker is the discord in the relationship. Domestic violence, more so violence against women is because of inequality in power equations between men and women at homes. Domestic violence is also influenced by cultural factors and values that tend to give emphasis on different roles and status of men and women in the society (McKie, 2005)."
"They are the perfect couple, without one another they would have no chance of success. For instance, there is George, who is reasonably bright and good at getting jobs and then there is Lennie, moronic, asinine but nevertheless a very good worker. They stick together through thick and thin and both use each other\u2019s strong points to help them complete tasks. \u201cI got you George and you got me.\u201d Lennie is very forgetful; this gets him in a lot of trouble with George. George also has to look after Lennie as he has a mind of a child."
"Everybody has someone they admire as a role model. You may be asking yourself, \u201cwho\u2019s his role model?\u201d Well my role model is my brother, and here\u2019s why. I chose this topic for my narrative, because my brother has successfully shaped my career as a model. This topic may interest you, to explore more about your role model to find out why he/she is your role model. In this narrative, you will be given insight on who my brother is, why he\u2019s my role model, and how I implement everything he has taught me about being a model."
"In the unique, of mice and men, theer was symbolizm throughout the story. In the start of the novel the stting was best, like \u201cThe Garden of Eden\u201d. LIke in \u201cThe Garden of Eden\u201d there was a snake, and in this novel it slipped throughout the water sggestin possible evil to come."
"Qutb was also a member of the Muslim Brotherhood an organization that is still around today and is considered a revolutionary movement that advocated the return to true Islam through the Quran and Hadith. Qutb became chief editor for the Muslim Brotherhood newspaper and occupied a significant role and find this as an opportunity to communicate his views."
"Welfare reform which was initiated in 1996 has taken its toll as well. This has resulted in the reduction in the use of eligible Medicaid recipients due to the unawareness of qualified individuals. Thus the number of uninsured persons rose even higher. There is no question that many African Americans use various social welfare programs which in some ways have closed the health care gap. However, the extent of care received by individuals who access programs like Medicare and Medicaid can be questioned. Treatment options available through health insurance companies are much more comprehensive relative to most social programs. The overall care in most cases is simply not the same."
"When he traveled to Congo, he saw black people doing harsh works like digging holes, etc. and if they did any kind of mistake, they were punished very badly by the white dominance. In this story, the evil nature can be seen throughout the character Kurtz from his greediness for ivory, violence, cruelty, and racial discrimination with Africans."
"For Belfast to become a united city, equality amongst all needs to be tackled. Workers doing the same job should get paid the same regardless of their race or nationality. Social cohesion can bring less violence among others, less crime and people can learn from one another in a cohesive community."
"Another important element that builds strong friendship is the value of \u201cgive and take\u201d. Initially, friendship is a mutual relationship. One benefits from the other as much as the other does. This relationship however does not cause to harm the other while the other takes advantage. This differentiates friendship from certain parasitic or one-sided relationships. In order to achieve this mutual benefit, it is important to acknowledge the importance of give in take in the relationship."
"On average children between two and five years old spend more than 25 hours a week in front of a TV screen. Children between six and eleven years spend on average 23 hours per week. Children between two and five years old are exposed to more television commercials than older children and 50% of the commercials are being seen in playback mode by them1. The USA has one of the highest numbers of advertisements per hour on television. These factors have contributed to concern among parents, governments, consumer organization, etc."
"According to the article Skenazy believes that helicopter moms reject the idea of freedom and hover their child\u2019s safety by having a needless overprotective security detail on their child at all times. Rosemary Walls, unlike typical \u201chelicopter parents\u201d today, allows her children to learn from life without parental help. Rosemary Walls felt that \u201cit was good for kids to do what they wanted because they learned a lot from their mistakes\u201d (Walls 59). This showed that Rose Mary did not worry herself about hovering over her children that caused other parents to make every decision for their children. Rose Mary encouraged autonomy and independence above all because throughout The Glass Castle, she never helped her children with anything and told them to do whatever they wanted without rules or guidelines. Rosemary was working on a painting a few days after Jeanette returns from the hospital (from the burns of cooking hotdogs). Jeanette asked her mother if she would cook her a hotdog; Rosemary said no. \u201c\u2018Good for you,\u2019 Mom said when she saw [Jeanette]\u00a0cooking. \u2018You\u2019ve got to get right back in the saddle. You can\u2019t live in fear of something as basic as fire'\u201d (Walls 15). This is a great case in point that Rose Mary lets her child, Jeanette, at the age of three have the independence to cook for herself."
"And I give some examples from other countries. What are the changes happened there after changing the laws about status and rights of illegitimate child. And I also develop my argument for the equal rights for illegitimate child and also for the woman who is being raped and become the mother of an illegitimate child. Here I write my argument in short. If one man and one woman give birth to two children, one born in under the conditions of valid marriage and he consider as a legitimate child, and other child is born in illicit, illegal relationship and considering as an illegitimate child."
"C. How big a problem? It affects everybody, the parents, the child, and the family. -Approximately one-third of American women become pregnant before the age of 20. -Twenty-five percent of teen mothers live below the federal poverty line. Nearly 80 percent of teen mothers eventually go on welfare. Teens that give birth also spend a greater length of time receiving public assistance\u2014an average of three years longer than older mothers through age 35. Teen mothers are also more likely to have lower family incomes later in life.(NARAL)"
"Simpson committed a double homicide. This was not a fact at the time of the trial but is is now after the research put into the case. The reason Simpson was let off the hook was because of the sloppy work the forensics department working on the case did. Examples of these sloppy mistakes include: \u201cplacing blood evidence swatches inside plastic, instead of paper containers, where their DNA could degrade; collecting some blood evidence weeks after the crimes had been committed; walking around for hours with a vial of blood evidence instead of delivering it immediately to a laboratory for preservation, packaging and storing, and spilling Mr. Simpson\u2019s blood in the very laboratory where, shortly after, other samples would be tested.\u201d (Kolata). Simpson being freed of his crimes led to major regulation changes amongst forensics. Now when dealing with DNA the samples are sent to the lab immediately also, the chain of possession sheet is always kept with the evidence and is clearly and thoroughly filled out."
"Firstly the increase of single parents (lone parents) has tripled since 1970s in the UK. About 25% of all families with dependent children are single-parent families. There are various reasons which contribute to the increase of single parenthood but one main one is the demographical changes in the UK, is divorce. Divorce was legalised in the early 1970s and as a consequences it is cheaper and easier to get a divorce and this one of the explanations for the growth in lone-parent families since the early 1970\u2019s."
"Sexism is evident from the first episode until the end of the tenth season through things such as the female characters\u2019 beauty ideals, stereotypical roles and actions, and the fact that their lives seem to revolve around relationships, men, and romance. The prominent female characters, Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe, are all slim, white, beautiful young women."
"I\u2019ve had time to really sit and think and realize the seriousness of my actions. I could of been arrested, charged with shoplifting and taken to juvenile detention center, banned from the mall, and end up with a criminal record, which would make it harder to get a job or get into college later. No one wants to hire someone with a record of stealing. I did not realize at the time, how much of an impact something I do now, as a teen, will and/or could, affect the rest of my life."
"Due to its ability in providing more accurate costing information and enhancing firms\u2019 performance, ABC is International Journal of Trade, Economics and Finance, Vol. 1, No. 2, August, 2010 2010-023X studies, which spanned 1995-2008 periods, were collected from four prominent refereed accounting research journals, in management accounting field: Journal of Management Accounting Research, Accounting, Organizations and Society, Management Accounting Research and British Accounting Review."
"And is she does this, it seems to me that she might easily transcend that early and unintentionally limiting classification \u201cblack woman writer\u201d and taker her place among the most serious, important and talented american novelists now working.\u201d(3). So much for supporting our fellow women writers! Although, Blackburn does admire Morrison\u2019s work, she just thinks that she shouldn\u2019t write about those things so she can be taken seriously to others. Why is it that we \u201cneed\u201d the approval of white establishment to be taken seriously as artist? I find that ridiculous. However, I do understand that they basically control everything that\u2019s out in the mainstream and we need to change that!"
"This facts sheet presents statistical information about trends in parents\u2019 engagement in paid work, examining mothers\u2019 and fathers\u2019 employment patterns. We provide detailed information about jobless families. Further, the ways in which families manage their work and care responsibilities is analysed, through presentation of statistics on their use of child care, paid parental and other leave, and other working arrangements."
"The character of Curley\u2019s wife is used to portray this. Throughout the book Curley\u2019s wife is never referred to her name which is unknown. This suggests that she is a possession belonging to Curley. By not having her name mentioned; Curley\u2019s wife remains distant even though she tells Lennie her life story as without a name she remains mysterious. Her marriage to Curley causes for her to be rejected by the ranch workers when she seeks out their attention and friendship."
"I have learned a lot about myself by applying these cultural identity models to myself. I don\u2019t think a lot about all of the privileged groups that I belong to, and I was honestly surprised by how many I am a part of after writing this paper. I enjoyed these self-assessments and models and I want to continue to be self-aware of my own self, culture and bias so that I can be an effective counselor to people of all cultures."
"The next case study presented involves an email phishing scam which ended up almost costing the organization a serious financial loss. Phishing is a scam where the criminal sends an email pretending to be from a legitimate company, with a legitimate looking website through the URL, in hopes of the victim providing the requested information. If successful, the criminal is free to use this information for personal gain. In this particular case study, which took place on January 24th, 2018 there was an email wire transfer request sent from the CEO of First Business Bank for $15, 850. The bank employee emailed back a blank wire request form, received the completed wire request form and wire agreement, with a valid signature that matched the signature of the CEO. The wire stransfer was then submitted. It was not until a phone call back to the clients phone number from the bank records indicated this was a fraudulent transaction and was stopped right away. All of the emails were directed automatically to the delete folder so neither the bookkeeper or CEO knew the fraud was happening. It as later determined by the banks IT department that the CEO and bookkeepers corporate emails were compromised in November 2017. From November 2017 to January 24th, 2018 the emails were monitored to gain the information needed to carry out the scam. Eventually police were able to trace the IP address back to South African however, it is very unlikely these criminals will ever be brought to justice."
"Philippe Bourgois book In Search of Respect: Selling Crack in El Barrio was published in 1995, and discussed his experiences of authors living in El Barrio (East Harlem). In 1985 the writer moved to this district of New York City with the purpose of studying the impact of imposed racial segregation and economic marginalization on the inner city Puerto Rican population (intro pg. 1). An interesting new insight into the street culture found in New York was captured in this book. The amount of poverty in this portion of our country is much higher than that in most other areas."
"S. population, according to Census figures. But by 2042, they are projected to become the majority, making up more than half the population. By 2050, 54 percent of the population will be minorities. (CNN, 2008) Racism is thought to only be white people, because of power, against all other races. Now days, you see racism against whites as well."
"The people in the courtroom are obviously also stunned; Danforth is actually dumbfounded Abigail says it is a lie, as she has everything else Mary and Proctor have accused her of. We now hear Francis speak and he clearly can\u2019t believe that John is a lecher. Danforth still dumbfounded asks for a time and a place. Proctor now seems to realise the effect of what he has just said as his voice begins to break and he struggles to speak."
"In the US, mass shootings increased in the past fifty years. According to The Washington Post, 1, 211 people were murdered in mass shootings in the United States since 1966 (Berkowitz, Bonnie, et al.). One of the mass shootings took place in a high school on February 14, 2018 in Florida. A former student, Nikolas Cruz, shot and killed 17 people and wounded 17 others at Marjory Douglas Stoneman High School."
"These gases saturate flouro carbons present in airand increases atmosphere temperature. Thes flouro carbons are emmited by feon gas used in refrigerator and air conditioned, other gas is ammonia chloride used in cold storage. These green house gases increases earth temperature and level of ocean become high due to melting of ice and glaciers as a result aquatic life also disturbs. Another effect of greenhouse gases is that it makes a hole in ozone layer.Ozone is a protective layer of oxygen which prevents harmful ultraviolet rays from reaching the earth surface."
"Students will have to understand the true meaning of one of the works of art that is presented in class, but given that fact that my pupils will be so young, I think the art will be taught more on symbolism. The average salary amount for an art teacher is $11 dollars an hour, more or less depending on how much education you have had. Communicating well is obviously a good characteristic in being a teacher, to students and to teachers as well."
"For instance, a manager\u2019s responsibility is to communicate with the workers and listen to their own points of views such as helpful suggestions or receptive to feedback for the organization. It\u2019s important for each employee to feel valued and respected instead of creating brutal rivalry or make one feel less about themselves; having the respect to treat each employee equally."
"Everybody was busy with the summer backyard barbecue and my cousins were really into a water game that they had made up for play so nobody was really watching me and I did not notice that I was standing on the danger zone step of the pool. The minute I lunged for the boat, I knew I was in trouble. The step disappeared from under me I found myself completely submerged and without any idea of how to stop myself from sinking. The next thing I knew, my dad was holding me by the shoulders and picking me out of the water."
"The theme of love and friendship is further demonstrated in the relationship between Celie and Mr. It is portrayed as questionable to a modern society, because of the constant exploitation (both physical and emotional) Celie has endured from Mr. At the outset of their relationship there was no love or friendship, Mr simply married Celie because \u201cShe\u2019d come with her own linen. And she [could] take that cow\u2026\u201d. It is evident when reading the novel at the beginning that Mr treats her like slave as a white man would to a black man, he also makes her do all of the housework and raise his abusive children and forces her to have sex with him. If Celie does not conform to any of his demands, he beats her, and Celie obeys this and thinks it is her place when \u201cSometimes he beat me anyhow\u2026whether I do what he say or not.\u201d Nonetheless, as Celie grows closer to standing up for herself, and with the help of Shug, she finds years of letters from her sister Nettie, which Mr has been hiding away. The fact that Mr has deceived her in relation to her beloved sister gives Celie the courage finally to stand up to him and leave with Shug. When Mr tells Celie \u201cYou black, you pore, you ugly, you a woman. Goddamn, he say you nothing at all.\u201d Celie replies, \u201cUntil you do right by me\u2026everything you dream about will fail\u2026every lick you hit me you will suffer twice.\u201d This proves that Celie has finally realised that she can control her own life. And upon Celie leaving, Mr decides to change his erroneous ways and becomes a friend to Celie."
"Moreso, much literature focus on urban localities, and ignores rural areas where child care standards still lags behind. Data relating to the actual process undergone by men in coming up with actual decisions to care, which then drive the observable care behaviour is still minute, especially within the Sub Saharan African context and Zimbabwe in particular. It is apparent that there are several factors surrounding men\u2019s decision to care for children, biological or non-biological, socio-economic, or technical among others. Nevertheless, such factors cannot be operating in isolation, but rather influence care decisions in various proportions depending on situations or locations."
"Overall, in the novel \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d Crooks is a stable back segregated from the rest of the men on the ranch because of the fact that he is black and perhaps because he is a cripple. It becomes clearly obvious to the reader of life in America during the 1930\u2019s and the racial discrimination at this time. Also due to the detailed description given by the author we are able to put ourselves in this character\u2019s position and see how hard life was for him on the ranch and have empathy towards him."
"I think is used to show the fight for equality within their relationship and the unsure stance they also feel. Perhaps it is also relative in reimbursing the fact that Carrie and Rona are isolated from the community, yet bound together because of their likeness. The space around this structure reflects the isolation of the characters. Their lack of place is true, in not only their personal relationship, but both socially and nationally \u2013 making structure truly important in relaying the themes. Cassie and Rona go on to describe themselves as \u201cfraudulent moochers\u201d, this expresses how they feel they lack social position. Also described as being in \u201cother people\u2019s territory\u201d, it would seem Cassie and Rona believe they have no place nationally either."
"Every human being is equal in the eyes of God. So no one has the right to kill another. The foetus has as much right to live as the mother. But it could be argued that nothing has rights until it is born. Also \u2018neighbour\u2019 could refer to the mother as well as the foetus. Then the question arises as to whose life is more valuable to God."
"Answer: My overall achievement I think I did well. I did extremely well academically. I went to university where I got my degree, and as a result I am currently a counsellor working with children. I met my husband while I was getting my degree and we hit it off, and have been inseparable since. As I had mentioned, I did have friends growing up however, made sure I kept the right friends in my life. I have a small group of friends but I am happy."
"Just to put it into perspective, consider this\u2026according to the CDC (2007), \u201cbefore polio immunizations began in 1955, polio reached a peak in the United States in 1952, with more than 21,000\u00a0paralytic cases. However, following introduction of effective vaccines, polio incidence declined rapidly. The last case of wild-virus polio acquired in the United States was in 1979.\u201d Today, there are no cases of polio to report in the United States. Consequently, problems linked with the vaccine go beyond the dangers of the disease itself. By virtue of its absence, the disease is no longer a reminder of the importance of immunizations."
"Often too happy to return to the use of \u201csavages\u201d, she certainly does not give the Natives much respect as is due, much like the encounter in \u201cHistory Lesson\u201d. As J R Miller writes, \u201cthe ethnographic approach to the study of indigenous peoples was problematic because it was a descriptive portrayal that rendered Natives static and unchanging. \u201d This is the case with Moodie\u2019s portrayal of the natives, as it is clear their way of life is seen as backward in her writing. Much of this however is to do with the provenance surrounding Roughing it in the Bush."
"Functionalism is a macro theory, as is Marxism, which means that it looks at society as a whole, rather than individual sectors of society (Cree, 2000). Functionalism is also a consensus theory, which means that Functionalists see society as being in harmony, and that everybody has an equal place in society (Kidd et al, 2003). Cree (2000) tells us that \u2018consensus approaches start with the assumption that there is one preferred, ideal family: the nuclear family\u2019 (p32)."
"However, it is useless to argue for the application of the Canadian approach in the United States. Circumstances are extremely\u00a0different. It is difficult to determine whether, and to what extent, American values and culture can yield to embrace the characteristic benefits derived from Canadian-style gun control. Clearly, Americans should embrace the White House\u2019s resolution to the propagation of gun-related bloodshed in the US. Many voters concur with the president with regards to the proposals, especially on universal background checks and harsher penalties for wrongful gun purchases. The president\u2019s take is synonymous with that of Harry Reid, Senate Majority Leaders, who has a positive rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA). To reiterate his position on the need for gun control measures, the president cited a string of mass shootings, which have happened during his tenure. Those who listened to the State of the Union Address comprised groups of people who had been directly or indirectly affected by gun violence."
"However, instead of becoming the country\u2019s strength, this mix culture has made the people more vulnerable to cultural assimilation of major mainstream culture like that of the Americans. These cultures situated in different regions have become a point of division among Filipinos; and which made the foreign settlers to easily manipulate the imposition of their cultures."
"This programe has helped to promote and retain the valuable staff (Lloyds TSB). Besides, Lloyds also provide a network called ACCESS for disabled employee, this network enable them to share information and received support on day-to-day issue that affects them. In addition, Lloyds approach to disability is to involve all employees. They provide brochure \u201cpositive about disability\u201d and a disability resource toolkit for all staff. They also provide training for line manages so they can provide help, advice and support for disabled employees (The Times 100)."
"While this is definitely one of my least favorite of this semester\u2019s readings, I have to say that Hemingway was a beautiful wordsmith who could make you feel as though you were part of the story. In this sentence, \u201cHe sat on the logs, smoking, drying in the sun, the sun warm on his back, the river shallow ahead entering the woods, curving into the woods, shallows, light glittering, big water-smooth rocks, cedars along the bank and white birches, the logs warm in the sun, smooth to sit on, without bark, gray to the touch; slowly the feeling of disappointment left him\u201d (Hemingway 262) you can practically feel the heat of the sun on your back and the relief that Nick feels as if a burden was lifted from your own chest. This story had some beautiful imagery overall though it was just not a tale I enjoyed reading."
"Naturally along with his ability to dramatize and over emphasize Herodotus also has a Proathenian Bias and presents a less laudable side of Sparta and their imperialist inclinations such as Sparta\u2019s early attempts to conquer Tegea and Cleomenes I attacking Argos where Herodotus reports that a large proportion of Argive infantry (6000 men) were killed in the conflict although the city itself was not taken and Argos who was once a worthy opponent of Sparta now \u201cwas left so short of men, that the management of town affairs fell into the hands of the slaves\u201d."
"Without diversity, creativity would be stagnant. Innovations would be severely delayed. The handling of some situations would lack understanding and tact, causing conflict that could\u2019ve been easily mitigated. Diversity is important because despite the tendency for rough beginnings, people feel that they can express themselves. Diverse viewpoints add to mission effectiveness and allow people of all walks of life a sense of belonging."
"Personally, I intend to also spread awareness to people around me about the adverse effects of racism and the importance of not being racial, It is for this case that I would be a patriotic citizen and look out for the good of the nation by first practicing racial equality then allowing others to follow suit. Secondly, I would be introspective which means I wouldn\u2019t give in to peer pressure to practicing racial inequality In conclusion, racial unbalance is a severe issue, but through the right policies, this problem can gradually be tamed to dealt with hence eradication."
"This was quite a low budget drama piece and cost i??195 to perform. There was one thing which wasn\u2019t spectacular but impressed me was the presentation of all the rooms in a micro form of their original selves in boxes. When every character got into deep dialogue or something in the scene was based on them they opened the box to show a miniature version of the characters bedroom. I wouldn\u2019t like to think of the play as being an imaginary world because what they showed was very real and I would like to say they depicted a real life event very well."
"The identified authorities policies impacting the Toys and Games industry relates to several concerns that safety to weights and step ordinances. These two countries out of the many specified ordinances depending on the location around the universe where plaything and games are sold. the safety country and weight measurings are dominately the primary concern. The safety statute law enforces the Toy Safety Directive 88/378/EEC that stricts the plaything company to adhere to stuffs non destructive to the environment or longtime negative exsposure to kids."
"Many characters in the novella Of Mice and Men are marginalised and are deemed outcasts. One of the many ways marginalisation is presented in \u2018Of Mice and Men\u2019 is sexism. This is clearly represented in this novella through the character Curley\u2019s wife and also about the way the men talk about women. Curley\u2019s wife isn\u2019t even named by John Steinbeck, so her identity is linked with her husband Curly. She is heavily discriminated and is treated as if she isn\u2019t of any importance."
"Bauzon\u2019s work, \u201cInfluence of the Spanish Culture\u201d, she pointed out that Spaniards transplanted their social, economic, and political institutions for about 333 years of colonial sovereign (1565-1898). Moreover, in order to administer the Philippines, the Spaniards extended their royal government to the Filipinos. This highly centralized governmental system was theocratic. There was a union of Church and State. The Roman Catholic Church was equal to and coterminous with the State. In addition, when we look into the perspective of the colonizers, the use of the pasyon simply affirms prevailing social structure in which the virtue of meekness and resignation to suffering, rather than the confrontation of the oppression, seems to have been encouraged."
"By 1991, India had more than 150,000 public health facilities through which family planning programs were offered. Four special family planning projects were implemented under the Seventh Five-Year Plan (FY 1985-89). One was the All-India Hospitals Post-partum Programme at district- and subdistrict-level hospitals. Another program involved the reorganization of primary health care facilities in urban slum areas, while another project reserved a specified number of hospital beds for tubal ligature operations."
"Maternity is established by the mother. Generally, it does not raise any doubt as the mother of the child except in the case of surrogate mother case[3]. In the Islamic sharia it is prohibited in case if surrogate mother is not married with the owner of the semen it means she should marry to the man of which semen is going to be use. But there will be a one question arise that to which of the two wives will be the child belong? Does it belong to the genetic mother (the first wife) or the biological mother (the second wife)[4]?"
"Thus proving or disproving this part of her argument may cause readers to reconsider her overall argument. English proposes a scenario where there are attackers at night that are armed with knives and will attack people walking by. English (and I) agree that one would have a right to kill the attacker in self-defense, but only if that is the only way to \u201cprotect your life or save yourself from serious injury.\u201d Next, English carries on with the idea of killing being the only way, and explores alternatives. How much harm can you do to your attacker? English concludes that the laws in the US allows one to inflict slightly greater injury to their attacker than what the injury could have been. It is after this introduction that English makes a parallel to this situation with the situations involving pregnancy. The mother is paralleled with the potential victim and the fetus is the potential threat to the mother\u2019s \u201cwell-being, life prospects or health, mental or physical.\u201d"
"According to Park (2008), it is very hard to separate culture from parental involvement. Especially, the relative effect may vary because of the behavior of the cultural context .relying on diversity that culture has, parental involvement engagement may differ from country to another as well as in family structure. Epstein (1992) claimed that there are six forms of parental involvement"
"Therefore the term \u201cmulticulturalism\u201c in these countries came to mean, and now means throughout the English-speaking world and beyond: the political accomodation by the state or a\u00a0dominant group of all minority cultures defined by reference to race or ethnicity. Nonetheless, even today, both in theoretical and policy discourses, multiculturalism means different things in different places."
"Mill might think the continuity of our genes is a factor contributing to the greater good of humanity, but morally, it is not wrong for us to choose to not take care of our parents when they get older, because in the past they have mistreated us, because we are enduring that presence of pain from putting up with people who have mistreated us. To Mill, there should be an extent to which we put up with our parents. You should take care of your parents out of love, not out of debt; we don\u2019t incur any sort of debt to our parents when we were born since we were simply incapable of understanding moral contracts. I know most of my friends\u2019 parents are seriously controlling when it comes to being successful in life, with their own definitions of success. They also use the basis of children carry a debt to them because they gave their children life itself, and no one can do that but them, hence the obligation to fulfill their impossible expectations."
"Those different views between whites and blacks in racism are a misconception that has been substantiating how people blur what truly is and is not racism. The more the topic of racism is ignored, the more the topic is becoming blurred in today\u2019s world. We can see in the past, through the movie, the evident signals of discrimination such as the obvious black bathroom sign that makes Katherine runs half a mile from her workplace or \u201cblack pot\u201d which her co-workers make to have not to drink coffee in the same pot with her. During the 1960s, those preposterous signals are obvious in society, which are different from now. In today\u2019s society, those signals are not disappeared but replaced by another cloudy way. Racism is not over, it just occurs subtler and more subconsciously."
"His room is just a small area in the stables with all his possession over the floor in his room unlike the ranch hands who have small boxes over their beds for their possessions. Crooks has many possessions such as magazines, a hairbrush, a flannel, soap and other small personal items. This shows that he is a very clean man and he taught himself how to read and write."
"She talked to my uncle and he talked to her father but he did not listen to his arguments, her father was very aggressive my uncle told him that job will make her better human and she can help the poor people both the sides were very aggressive in their approach and suffered due to this conflict this was the (b. a surge of violence on one side) stage in deadlock according to the (PPU, 2008) that her father said that she should married and no jobs for her. My uncle found a proposal for her the boy had completed his education from America university fortunately they both were cousin. It was agreed upon between the elders of the family that she will engaged first then she will allowed to do job. Therefore a compromise helped to save the happiness of all the family. This incident happened five years ago now a days they are living happy life."
"In 1909, the movement included liberalized whites and it changed to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (Media Projects Incorporated 39). It comprised of African Americans and liberal whites and it sought equality between the whites and African Americans. Another organization is the American Citizens\u2019 Equal Rights Association which fought for equality. Different people led the African Americans at this time. One of these is Booker T. Washington who was the founder of the Tuskegee Institute."
"Implementation of the rules and laws of immigration also considers the relationship with the country of origin of the immigrants. It is also noted the United Nations monitor and influences the countries in making their rules for the benefit of both parties as well as making their own study and recommendations. Though the immigrants and their families experience hard adjustments on each others absence, they are ease of the burden of poverty."
"S.A or Mexico. Currently the country taking most of Canada\u2019s work force is the U.S with their grip on technology they are in fact luring Canadians, the media has called this the \u201cBrain Drain\u201d. NAFTA has also created environmental issues such as a four-lane highway just for trucks, to make it easier to transport products to one side of the border to the other, which may or may not be built. But if NAFTA intended to be a good for the nation then why has it turned out to be so bad, would it be in Canada\u2019s best interest that NAFTA is re-signed."
"White Chicks, released in 2004, was directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans and written by Keenen Ivory Wayans, Shawn Wayans, and Marlon Wayans, with the latter two starring as the main characters. The film begins with Kevin Copeland and Marcus Copeland (Shawn and Marlon Wayans) disguised as old Caribbean men attempting to take down a drug organization that sells drugs inside ice cream containers."
"It is that internal spark needed to make things happen \u2013 basically to get off the sofa and get into action. An inspiring individual is uplifting, stimulating, exciting and motivates. This person can light the fire needed to begin the action. This is exactly what a coach does \u2013 lights a fire within their client to make changes. What is a coach? Simply a guide who ascertains a perspective outside the life \u201cgame\u201d that the client is in the midst of."
"Women who were not used to engaging in the workforce were able to find jobs, such as civil services and even as teachers, which no women had done prior. Women became both happy and stressed from their updated lifestyles. Thousands of women helped in the war effort by becoming nurses. One specific example is Janie Smith. During the civil war, her previously peaceful farm was transformed into a hospital for wounded soldiers."
"The fourth and final stage occurs after the delivery of the placenta and about 1 \u2013 2 hours after birth. It is a time of maternal physiological adaptation or adjustment. During this stage, the uterus should feel firm and contracted. Some women may feel a little uncomfortable or some pain in the perineal area. This is usually related to a laceration or episiotomy or hemorrhoids. The mother will feel excited and tired during this stage. She will begin to bond with her infant and start breastfeeding or giving the newborn a bottle (Ward & Hisley, 2016)."
"Shorter came to state that capitalism entitled a source for females to be independent and have sexual freedom. The low wage, young people started the involvement in the market economy. The prosperous women soon followed in the nineteenth century. For unmarried women capitalism meant personal and sexual freedom. Young women were able to go against parental controls with her sexual and emotional independence because she knew the market would still hire her and give her self-sufficiency, and if needed, would move her to a town where she could work. This lead to the absence of birth control and therefore illegitimacy. You say more than necessary in the first paragraph of this section; your explanation of the argument could be stronger."
"Research at the African Mental Health foundation says that in the last four years the use of alcohol and other drugs among young people has increased by a staggering 71 percent. In Kenya, unrecorded alcohol consumption is estimated to be 5. 0 litres of pure alcohol per capita for population older than 15 years for the years after 1995, estimated by a group of key alcohol experts (WHO, 2004). A 1997 to 1998 survey sponsored by the Economic ad Social Research council and The British Institute"
"This would include how a pregnancy would end. The Supreme Court also has recognized the interest of the states in protection potential life and has attempted to spell out the extent to which the states may regulate and even prohibit abortions. In Roe v. Wade, the United States Supreme Court held the Texas penal abortion law unconstitutional, stating this: \u201cState criminal abortion statutes\u2026that except from criminality only a lifesaving procedure on behalf of the mother, without regard to the stage of her pregnancy and other interests involved is violating the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (Pozgar, 2008)."
"Of all the living beings inhabiting this earth, trees are out best friends. Mother Nature,in her infinite wisdom, has gifted them to man to live in harmony with him and to be of greatservice to him.Besides fruits, trees provide important raw materials for our industries. Industries provide employment to people. The wood for furniture, housing, railway carriages and shipscome from trees. Wood is also used for fuel and for making charcoal which is used as fuel.From trees we get wood \u2013 pulp to make paper and artificial yarns (like nylon)."
"The switching between languages clearly conveys the multiple and complementary identities its speakers create for themselves. They have created a \u2018social community\u2019 taking on the role of stereotype images of Spaniards or Americans that exist in the Philippine popular imagination adding \u201clocal color\u201d to their everyday discourse. They communicate with other \u2018conyo\u2019 speakers directly, without the need of explanations. Discussions on why \u2018conyo\u2019 talk exists have gone beyond face-to-face everyday conversation. \u2018Conyo\u2019 speakers have created an effective space through the help of Internet where anyone from anywhere can join in. And \u201cspace is fundamental in any form of power of communal life\u201d (Foucault 2000, p. 361)."
"To conclude, I will continue to be active in marches to stand up for a better solution for undocumented immigrants coming to seek a better life. I have faith in the United States that has seen me grow up to be a hard-working citizen just like they are wanting to become. We have a lot ahead of us and will still need to fight harder but the power of unity and of peace overcomes anything that will stand in the way. Allowing illegal immigrants to work in the United States will always bring positive outcomes."
"Adversity implies difficulties, trouble and misfortune as it tests the potential of man and strengthens his spirit of self confidence. In the novel Indian Horse written by Richard Wagamese there are many circumstances where the main character Saul is forced to overcome the adversity in which once shattered his human spirit and made him feel worthless."
"The teacher is not only there to help children throughout their learning years, but they are also there to listen and be someone that children look up to. Children are always taking in everything around them. If their teacher is dressing in a manner that looks like they are going for a day out with their family, partying with friends, or even working at part time jobs that are less than upholding the professional statute of a teacher this can become very distracting for the students. It can also allow for the students to not see the teacher as a person that they have to take seriously. Parents also have certain expectations of the learning environment that their children will be in, whether it be public or private schooling."
"With the support of the outreach programs in the community, the number of volunteers needed can be easily attained. While some may be concerned about the continued maintenance and upkeep of the completed project, the KaBoom.org website also states that, \u2018By getting the community involved, there is greater ownership, which increases the continual maintenance down the road\u2019 (KaBoom.org). Having the community involved to create an updated and expanded playground for the children will help give those volunteers a desire to maintain all the improvements they helped to accomplish. With the assistance of these selfless volunteers, the expansion and revitalization of the current playground is possible."
"Global Warming is the rise in the average temperature of Earth\u2019s atmosphere and oceans since the late 19th century and its projected continuation. Many people do not see this as a problem. However, it is currently a huge issue that is often talked about among scientists and many other people. Global Warming is caused by many different things. Greenhouse gases, deforestation, and solar activity are three different proven facts that cause global warming. Global warming is not something that is going to disappear; it is only going to get worse if people do not start doing something about it."
"Omed resides in Bamiyan, Afghanistan with his loving widowed mother and younger siblings. This portrays the hardship and responsibility as the eldest among his siblings, also the belonging he felt as he was said to be his father\u2019s jewel (favourite). However when he successfully sought asylum in Australia, he was alienated from the Australian community to a great extent. This was due to his unusual customs and poor social behaviour because his tongue was badly mutilated from the punishment of the Taliban\u2019s. This set odds between him and the strange community he set his footing on."
"And that reason is because they have money. First, Curley has a lot of money. Curley is disliked among the workers because the only reason he is superior is because of nepotism, since his dad is the boss he is favored and gets \u201cspecial treatment.\u201d Curley has a very big head, which doesn\u2019t match his small physical appearance. This causes him to pick up fights just to prove himself on the ranch, Lastly; the boss is at the top because he has money. In many circumstances money makes people powerful. Hence the boss being at the top of the social hierarchy pyramid."
"It enhanced the play because in the round everyone in the audience was so much closer to the actors they felt part of it. Even if an actor trod on your foot or felt on you; it all made you feel part of the play. At times the actors even interacted with the audience. All changes made to the set during moving equipment or anything was very y clear throughout the play. From what I noticed the actors did not have costumes and just had casual work clothes on but this did not take anything from the effect away. Due to there being no costumes in the play; the costumes were consistent throughout the play."
"They have also been shown to be capable of delivering favourable clinical outcomes related to general quality of life and test results. (Anderson, 2001) In order to be relevant and effective, management plans for children must take into consideration their age, growth and development issues, cognitive functioning, and family dynamics (ADA, 2003). It is particularly important and challenging to instill in adolescents a sense of confidence, competence, and independence about managing their disease, without losing sight of the fact that they are not yet adults. Hanna, 2003). It is also essential to make them feel good about themselves with short \u201cbursts\u201d of improved management, support groups, summer camps, lectures, and additional education. (Anderson, 2001)"
"I can\u2019t go on any longer. I tried to change. Even my name changed. It isn\u2019t fair on my baby if I carry on its life and it isn\u2019t fair on me if I carry on mine. By living I am hurting myself, putting myself though years more pain and rejection. I am going to end it now. Maybe then people like Eric and Gerald and especially Mrs Birling will see what they have done. Not forgetting Mr Birling and the girl that sacked me from Millwards. I am going to help my baby and of course myself, this is the easiest way."
"When the SOCREL was not included in the analysis, there was no difference in happiness between people who read or who don\u2019t read books. However, when you look at the analysis of people who don\u2019t spend time with family very often, books do have an effect on their happiness. Therefore one could infer that those who lack social support from their families are able to find support in the form of books. Outside of the books themselves, the notion of family is in and of itself its own symbol. Symbolic interactionism theory would say that humans react to the meaning certain symbols have for them. Those who value the symbolic nature of family will of course be emotionally impacted when they are unable to see their family members. The value of a book increases when that is a person\u2019s primary source of emotional fulfillment, and at that point it becomes a more valued symbol and has a more drastic impact on that person\u2019s life and happiness. Coming back to my original theory, one could infer that those without either social support in the form of their families, or the symbolic support that one can find in books, a person could find themselves in a state of anomie and turn to crime in order to find meaning, or in the context of gang violence, a sense of community or family."
"In the current study there were three participants: Kyle (age 10), Aidan (age 10), and Nico (age 11). All three of the boys were diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder and made some errors on the placement test that had qualified them to participate in this study. The authors of this paper were the ones who conducted the study."
"Marijuana should be legalized for medical use across the country. Marijuana has a negative stigma attached by the government and public, but is actually a natural and effective medicine. The argument about medical marijuana is starting to spread across the country like wildfire, and the topic should be addressed. This paper will go into depth explanation and reasoning on why medical marijuana should be legalized as soon as possible."
"Across the country and within Missouri, many low income parents find themselves making difficult, and nearly impossible decisions for their children. As low income individuals begin to earn more money, many parents become ineligible for child care subsidies which had previously helped families access quality child care. Without this support, parents are forced to choose whether their jobs, that bring in this income, are worth the necessary child care costs. This is particularly salient at the time of this writing as MO voters just voted to raise the minimum wage. As the minimum wage increases, even a modest amount, the necessary support families receive will dramatically decrease. Approximately 44,000 Missourians will be affected. Importantly, more than 7 in 10 of the workers who will be affected are women, many of whom are raising children. Increasing minimum wage to a living wage is an important justice issue, but it can\u2019t be done alone Clark Fox Policy Institute, 2018, p.5)."
"The title of the poem demonstrates this trough a paradox, she never actually got to be a \u201cMother\u201d because she aborted her baby. The line in which she states, \u201cyou will never end up sucking thumb\u201d reinforces all this as well as demonstrates her use of imagery thought the entire poem."
"And let me tell you , the thought of that is way better than living in the ranch and being ignored by those white ranch workers. Well, I\u2019m not always ignored, I mean last Christmas I actually was invited in to celebrate with them, they even gave me some whiskey,It was by far an amazing night for me, but then again anything\u2019s better than spending Christmas alone in the dark with the horses. And one of the new guys even came into my room and actually gave me company for the first time in many many years."
"Constructivism is the finest theory for comprehending the occasions in Syria because it reveals how social identities and an actors\u2019 interests and preferences are socially constructed and can prompt conflict. Due to the numerous groups motivated in this conflict numerous social identities exist which are incompatible. Ultimately, the Syrian Civil War is an identity dispute with each identity including their own beliefs that each discover special. As identities and interests are constitutive, the interests of a group function as a propellant for social action (Bozdaglioglu, 2007, pp. 131-132). For that reason these constructed interests motivate the social identities of the groups and require to be redefined in order for trust to be developed. A social identity can be defined as a socially built set of meanings that one credits to oneself (Bozdaglioglu, 2007, p. 132). It is developed predominately through the political options and the actor\u2019s interactions, assumptions, analysis and cumulative meanings and serves a core function in the Syrian dispute (Adler, 1997, p. 324)."
"Flying Start is a support service which is a Welsh Government programme that is being used to help provide a range of services that is used to give young children the best possible start they can to their academic lives. Flying Start is being used for the young children between the ages 2-3 years old where they will get the quality part-time childcare to have an enhanced health visiting service. Also, when bringing your child to a Flying Start setting it will also give you the access to having parenting support with your child\u2019s speech, language and communication skills, (FamilyPoint.cymru, 2018)."
"Also that \u201cThe competitive consumption, the idea that spending is in large part driven by a comparative or competitive process in which individuals try to keep up with the norms of the social group with which they identify as a reference group\u201d (412). Finally she believes that \u201cLow income children are more likely to be exposed to commercials at school, as well as home\u201d (413)."
"Pollard, pg 49, 1993). For the first time they also did not relay on male labour, women unskilled but adaptable were able to enter the work arena. New industries such as electrical engineering, motor industry, paper and printing were developing. Substitute materials such as Rayon and Nylon were cheaper to mass produce, oil was beginning to replace coal and steam engines were taken over by diesel engines (B. Alford). Electricity aided the development of the new industries, however throughout the 1920\u2019s Britain fell behind other countries regarding consumption of electricity."
"The socio-political regime of multiculturalism in France is based on three different levels. The first one is the one of the immigrants. It guarantees them the right of cultural difference regarding their language, religion and customs. Meanwhile it requests that the immigrants respect the constitutional order of the receiving country and abandon such cultural practices that would infringe the French consitution, for instance forced marriage. The second level concerns indigenous French who are obliged to cease discriminating the immigrants in various domains of public life merely because of their origine."
"This is well portrayed by the hesitations of Benny and Eve, as their individual boyfriends begin requesting more physical involvement. Of the major obstacles standing between Eve and her biological family, the Westwards, one of the most prominent is the fact that she is a Catholic girl who was raised by nuns. The Westwards are vigorously loyal to their Protestant faith, and for that reason, among others, they disassociate themselves with Eve, a first cousin. When Eve goes to ask Simon to pay her university fees, and he questions her about how much it costs for a year at Trinity, the city\u2019s Protestant college, sparks fly."
"As society has become more diverse, people have developed different values, and now lead much more varied lives. In conclusion, I think I have shown that Murdock\u2019s evaluation of the family is no longer relevant in today\u2019s society. I think that a more appropriate definition of family would be any variety where there are two generations that are somehow related, either through marriage or biologically, that live together in the same household."
"If I did not obtain the same level of education as my subordinates, I would not be as effective a leader. If I fail selection to the next higher pay grade. an associate degree will afford me the opportunity to enhance my career and will better prepare me when entering the work force after retirement."
"In addition, some of the other red flags to the present problems included wealthy individuals complaining about the limited services being offered to them, other clients in Retail Operations feeling overshadowed by wealthier clients in External Deposits (and were leaving the bank), and the lack of understanding (no clear guidelines) by Retail and External as the best way to handle the new market segment. This lack of coordination compromised the bank\u2019s efficiency and created trust issues between these two departments as to the best way to help clients."
"Police officers are less likely to ask out and go against the law if they know they are being recorded. The body cameras would also decrease the chance of a criminal doing something to hurt the police officer because they wouldn\u2019t want the evidence of that incident with their face in it. An example of injustice would be the case of Trayvon Martin."
"Valuing and promoting cultural diversity can help with the education that we give to the children and young people we work with as they can learn about different cultures, habits and other things unique to a specific culture. It also helps to promote education through books but also by facing different cultural issues in the classroom and how to overcome them. At Hillbourne in Year 1 the TA, Mrs. C has bought in different things like artefacts and\u00a0necklaces from different places she had been when it is relevant to a topic they are doing for the children to look at. This helps them to find out about things and objects that we don\u2019t necessarily get in this country while learning about another country and can also compare the way things are made from that country to the way they are here."
"Humans talk to ourselves by carrying a conversation that is constantly researched by scientists and psychologists. A majority of the time when this is done by adults it is a way of self criticism. Mistakes are commonly made, but what is more important is that typically we react to these situations in a negative way. When children absorb this information, they begin to fall into the trap of \u201cself-defeating inner criticism\u201d (Kusa, 2001). During childhood, much of self talk takes place out loud. It guides the way that we play and the way that we learn. If you listen to a toddler play, you will hear words being sounded out and repeated. You will also hear tasks being described briefly and cute phrases of encouragement or defeat. This is obviously learned from adults. Children\u2019s self talk is largely influenced by the adults who teach and care for them. Children whose teachers and caregivers teach them to use calm logical language when learning a task will go on to use that language on their own. On the other hand if a child\u2019s teacher or caregiver is negative and impatient the child will learn to use the same type of self-defeating self-talk when they are on their own (Diamond, 2006). This is evidence that self talk is a form of learning. Kusa and Diamond are correct in saying that self-talk is a way of learning and that this is greatly influenced by caregivers and society. However, self-talk is not just used as a tool for learning, but it is also a social act. By engaging in self-talk, children internalize what they have been taught by society and their family. This means that they also carry on the societal beliefs presented to them at a young age. Self-talk has deep and lasting effects on each of us, as we internalize these societal pressures and grow and change into adults. It also seems that children have a skill most adults assume is not present yet. Very young children can be far more attuned to the \u201cdesires, preferences, beliefs, and emotions\u201d of others, including adults, than we assume. Children are able to judge when a human behavior is normal or socially acceptable versus when it is unusual (Middle Sexes, 2005)."
"Most of us recognize the great harm that stereotypes have had on specific people groups over the years, as well as on our society as a whole, there is a very real reason to be concerned about what the time to come might hold if the next generation grows up assuming that dads are inherently incompetent. When it comes to cleaning a lot of the older generations have been raised to think that cleaning is the women\u2019s job and going to work and earning money is the man\u2019s job and this idea of ideology takes presidency in the Libman Mop Power Washing advertisement. Now of course it\u2019s such a simple product to use you\u2019d think that anyone would be able to pick it up and use it but this is defiantly not the case, again the male is depicted as the idiot using a power water tool inside the house which would normally be used on a car or on a driveway externally but the adds inferring again that the male does not understand the simplicity of a simple mop, application of use and poses the women as the saviour. From a marketing perspective the product is again being pitched at the women because she is the only one that can show the male how to use it and the assumption is the male just does not get the simplicity of the product and aligning with gender roles."
"Transfers have become manifest negotiable instruments. It is constant threat hangs like the sword of Damocles over their heads. Eager to please, at times police itself tend to resort too politicking and hobnobbing with functionaries outside the system for personnel favors and gains. All these make the possibility of professional policing a distant dream (CHRI 2002; Chattoraj 1999, Rao 2001; Saha 2002)."
"The pattern of racial bias in America shows that African Americans are disportionately more likely to be killed by police than white Americans. In 2018 blacks made up 12.7% of the U.S population yet blacks made up 26.7% of people killed by the police. White Americans made up 61.3% of the population and 50% of those killed by police. This means blacks are three times more likely to be killed by police than their white counterparts."
"Although her mother never was employed at a public or private business, she worked at home relentlessly. During the day, she worked on the farm, cooked for her family, and cleaned the house; at night, she sewed rugs and clothes for her children. Martha Smith continued to sew and plant a garden in her old age as well as when her children were grown and on their own. The passing of time was revealed in the years Smith-Yackel\u2019s siblings were born. They were also revealed in the passing of seasons for farming."
"We get the feeling that Prufrock, who is aging, would do things differently if given another chance. In lines 49-54, Prufrock asserts his overall boredom with life. He says he has \u201cknown them all already, known them all-have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons\u201d. From this we can infer that Prufrock seems to feel as if his life is over and he has no more to offer. He makes statements similar to this throughout the poem. He proclaims to have known \u201cthe eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase\u201d and the \u201carms that are bracleted and white and bare\u201d. We get more of a sense of Prufrock\u2019s disillusionment of life with his many references to time. In lines 24-34, he claims there is time to \u201cmeet faces\u201d, \u201cmurder and create\u201d, have a \u201chundred indecisions\u201d and a \u201chundred visions and revisions\u201d."
"Duality is a key concept in many of Margaret Atwood\u2019s works. \u201cIt Is Dangerous To Read Newspapers\u201d comes with no surprise when the juxtaposition of time eras are presented. The poem addresses the atrocities of the Vietnam War that occurred from 1959-1975. The work is focused on the adult perception of the war by the speaker. The 9 stanzas that structure the poem are a continuous construction of the horror elements creating an overall image of the war and the inability of the speaker to participate in it, in any shape or form."
"One might argue the fact that the soon to be child is undoubtedly an human. They will possess their own genetics, skin, tissues and organs and body. In that case they are in no way a part of the female\u2019s body. With this logic, to kill this human is the same as committing murder to another human."
"Every one of these reasons of discrimination is used by individuals and groups within society to exclude others from life\u2019s chances. There are different effects on people depending why they are being discriminated against. People who are discriminated against can experience short or long term effects, in the short term effects people may feel anger and loss of their self-esteem. In the long-term effects they may be further reaching such as detrimental employment prospects or a lack of motivation. The effects are therefore to fold an effect on the individual themselves, and on their place and status as a whole. These affects have been recognised and there are now a number of laws in place which deal with equal rights for\u00a0every one there\u2019s loads of different emotions people can feel if being discriminated against these could be:"
"Majority of the opponents of the ban however still feel that the current number of illegal immigrants in school is not yet a burden or an issue of concern to warrant such crude measures. It is believed that the cessation of government support to immigrant\u2019s education would go along way in ensuring that illegal immigration is reduced by a large magnitude. This is attributed to the fact that any form of gain acts as an incentive to the immigrants (Haines & Rosenblum 133)Immigrant workers have been negatively affected by the immigrants\u2019 laws in some states in America. Oklahoma, which has one of the toughest new laws, now prevents illegal immigrants from getting state services."
"I can\u2019t say that my personality has unique features of character. I am just like an ordinary perseverant girl who aims to become a doctor. What makes me special is not the color of my skin, is not the fact that I am an orphan. I hate when people pity me for these things and give me preferences. I have a strong character which is the most significant spur in my life. I know how to study efficiently and use my knowledge in practice, I am good at Chemistry, and I had the highest scores at school. I know how to get what I want and overcome all the difficulties."
"It is powered by an octa-core processor, which features two dual cores with 2.6 GHz, 1.92 Ghz and four cores clocked at 1.8Ghz, the whole processor is working upon Hisilicon 980 chipset. It also includes a dedicated NPU unit. This will make your phone run faster while running multiple apps in the background. For smoother gaming experiences, Huawei has also built-in support for GPU Turbo technology on the phone."
"Guidance and counselling is an educational process by helping one to solve the problems that occur in their life. The role of a counselor is to work with individuals, groups and communities to improve mental health such as encouraging clients to discuss about emotions and experiences that can affect mental health if neglected as well as examine issues including substance abuse, bullying, careers, depression, relationships, self-image, LGBT and suicide."
"To be a Global Citizen means to take actions and fulfil some duties in order to improve someone\u2019s life. Global Citizenship should not be focused on scale of an action because helping people starts from little steps, from helping even one unknown person. Therefore, most of people, who are helping others that need a support, can be considered as Global Citizens. The majority of these human beings understand that they somehow may effect on people, who live on the other side of the Earth. Thus, they think broadly and care about surrounding people and nature."
"The researchers utilized two theories, namely Resilience Theory and Peak-end Theory, that will enable them to properly attain the data and to meet the objectives of the study. First and foremost, the Resilience Theory which is basically about the resiliency of individuals\u2060\u2014how they adapt to difficulties and how they overcome their struggles. With the help of this theory, the way single parents bounce back despite several challenges on their way will be discerned. Secondly, which is also the last theory, the Peak-end theory pertains to how people remember as well as attribute their experiences based on how they feel in a particular situation and how they interpret a specific event. Considering that emotions and feelings are able to embed in an individual\u2019s perception, through this theory, the perspective-taking of single parents will be recognized, retaining a vital role in initiating happiness."
"Raphael\u2019s key qualities are friendliness, selfless and clever. Raphael shows the quality of friendly in the scene where he listen to Rat when nobody knows what he is doing. A quote which gives evidence of this quality is \u201cand I\u2019d listen to his chit chat singing\u201d (Mulligan,2011, p.23). Another important quality that Raphael shows is selfless. He demonstrates this quality in the scene where he wants to give Rat some food for him to eat. A quote which gives evidence of this quality is \u201cI thought, I should have brought him a bit of food\u201d (Mulligan, 2011, pg.22). Finally, Raphael\u2019s quality of clever is shown in the scene where he trying to figure out the code for the words. A quote which gives evidence of this quality is \u201c go to the map ref where we lay look for the brightest my child.\u201d (Mulligan, 2011 , pg.152). All of these qualities help Raphael to overcome his hardships and\u00a0be a good friend to Gardo and Raphael\u2026."
"The apology was addressed to all natives and most significantly. the stolen coevalss. To the female parents and male parents. the brothers and sisters. for the interrupting up of households and communities. we say regretful. And for the indignity and debasement therefore inflicted upon a proud people and proud civilization. we say regretful. \u201d Mr. Rudd finished his address with this shutting statement before having a standing ovation ( New York Times. Johnson ) . Although this apology demonstrates how most of Australia is ready to go on germinating and travel on from all the subjugation. a survey conducted in 2008 found that \u201cAustralians in general are welcoming of diverseness. but some 1 in 10 Australians still keep racialist views\u201d ."
"Another idea that the protestors give about this community service issue is time constraints will make it close to impossible for high school students to fill the necessary 24 hours needed to graduate. High school students have an enormous amount of things going on in their lives. They attend school daily for 7 hours, participate in extra-curricular activities, and have part-time jobs. High school students have such a limited amount of time for themselves, as it is that by tacking on another time-consuming project like community service is ridiculous. Supporters argue back that high school students only need to fulfill 24 hours of community service throughout 4 years, that really isn\u2019t asking a whole lot of time commitment. If students budget their time and start the community service when they are a freshman all they need to do is an hour every other week and they will still be done\u00a0with a year or so to spare."
"The result of this Credo is a healthy bottom line that is socially responsible. J&J history of philanthropy through partnering with other\u00a0companies from around the world has created programs dedicated to providing needed services over the long term. J&J does not have a mission statement because the ethical principals listed in the Credo drive the company. The customer first philosophy insures the needs of the customer are met. Another principal outlined in the Credo is the dedication to producing a high quality product. Through this set of values the company has developed a trust with the consumers of their products. Trust develops into a reputation of integrity that in turn provides the company with a basis for business strategies. This ethical high road approach is a proven winner in this function."
"They the police that be riding them regular cars and look like regular people. They like \u201cwhat you doing on this corner?\u201d And I\u2019m just steady talking to \u2019em and they thought I had some dope in my mouth. So this one cop grabbed me and just started squeezing my throat. I was coughing and spitting up stuff and I\u2019m like \u201cwhat you all doing this for?\u201d and they kept on like \u201cdon\u2019t swallow it son.\u201d I\u2019m like \u201cswallow, I ain\u2019t got no dope!\u201d I opened up my mouth after they let go. I was showing them and everything. This type of action taken by police just to find drugs was unnecessary and there was no need to physical harm this person because of a belief of concealed drugs that was never there. African Americans are put into situations that end violent that are mostly the use of excessive force from the officer. In the article of \u2018Police Don\u2019t Like Black People\u2019 another black youth describes what he witnessed from officers. Doug explained: I saw my uncle [get beat up by the police]. They said he had a gun, but they didn\u2019t find no gun so they couldn\u2019t say that. Then they said he was resisting arrest so they beat him up and stuff like that. But I ain\u2019t see no resisting arrest [especially] when they have the cuffs on you, you can \u2018t resist no more. Then they maced him, and I felt like how is he resisting now? Only thing he trying to do is get that [mace] out his eyes. And then I still saw them hitting him with clubs and stuff. This gives a glimpse of that abuse of power that police have and the exceeding of their limits of violence when involving themselves in a situation. Police brutality isn\u2019t just a problem, but a inflicting issue that needs to be fixed."
"Women experience higher levels of poverty because they are not seen as individually valuable. They have lower social standings, they are seen as near the bottom of the list of importance. They are mainly seen as belongings and sublets of their men. They do not have equal rights to family resources, land or livestock and they have unequal rights within their family structure. They are subjected to discrimination and subjugation inside and outside of their homes (Kehler 2001). Unemployment among the rural women in Sub-Sahara is approximately 55% compared to that of the men which is approximately 37% (Kehler 2001). Women have limited access to education and training in skills that could advance their social standings. Their access to resources are controlled by things such as race and class. For instance, the poor black woman has substantially less access to resources, opportunities, and education as well as access to the growth and wealth of the country. They are expected to work under all conditions, including pregnancy."
"The court ruled that the death penalty was an appropriate punishment in extreme criminal cases and that Georgia had settled appropriate values and other precautions to guide a jury\u2019s considerations in capital cases. He was sentence to death penalty do to the fact that he entered the house armed so he meant danger to the community and that his purpose was to commit the crime. The United States Supreme Court stated that the execution of Troy Leon Gregg was Constitutional due to the fact that Mr. Gregg was tried, head and sentenced through a formal judicial system. The night before he was supposed to be killed, Gregg escaped from prison and was killed in North Carolina following a fight. (7 law cornell) In this case the court upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty, defending statutes that guide judges and juries in the decision to issue the death sentence."
"According to some that believe in God and feel that the death penalty is acceptable under the scriptures, make one main point, which is that \u201cThis is not an issue that may be measured accurately in terms of statistics. No one can ever know how many potential murderers have refrained from taking human life due to their fear of prosecution, conviction, and ultimate execution\u201d (Jackson, 2003). It is also questioned during this same argument that those who conclude that the death penalty is not a deterrent to violent crime should also be able to conclude that prison is not a deterrent either, since people seem to keep committing crimes, whether or not they think they will go to jail."
"If they did not want to participate in an interview with someone they did not like, they were not forced to. Even though there was more sexual freedom at Oneida, there were certain rules that the society had to follow regarding sexuality. Monogamous relationships were forbidden so if a couple was becoming too close, then the society would let them know and they would try to prevent it. Noyes Robertson explained that, \u201cNo couples were to show \u2018exclusive love\u2019 for one another; and if a man and woman began to have a disproportionate number of sexual encounters\u201d (139)."
"What struck me was that the hospital has been receiving a considerable amount of national subsidy. Thus, I realized that there was mismanagement on the part of the hospital administration, as most funds were used for labor costs resulting in the inefficiency of health services. Furthermore, I also saw this problem in some environmental conservation movements of NGOs in Korea and in the Nevada Conservation Corps (NCC), which I both participated in."
"Over the years, the levels of greenhouse gas emissions have been on a steady increase. However it was only at the start of the 1970s that concern was raised over the effect it was having upon the earth. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), there is evidence to suggest that the average temperature of the earth has been on a steady increase over the past 100 years."
"I could not begin to think that during this reformation that Japan was going hrough that Sensei was the only one drinking sak\u2019e. Although Sensei\u2019s wife was not the biggest fan of the drink Sensei sure did enjoy it. Looking at the relationship between Sensei and his wife I couldn\u2019t help to notice the extreme devotion they had towards each other. Although throughout the book Sensei\u2019s wife Shizu always seemed to express herself more, you could tell that Sensei had the same devotion. Shizu was always very obedient to Sensei needs. I imagine that this was custom for women at this time in early Japan to be very obedient to their husbands."
"If someone knows that they cannot afford a child why bring them into this world to suffer? That is why some women choose to pay that one time cost of an abortion , than to pay the dues to raise a child forever. Now that prenatal testing can so easily detect babies with physical and mental disabilities, more and more women are choosing to abort their children if something is wrong with them. For example, up to 92% of women whose tests show that they are carrying babies with Down syndrome abort (Sarah Terzo)."
"With all the research present this is no longer a buzzword but a crucial piece of implementing prevention and intervention services for individuals and families. There have been many recent recommendations for creation of trauma-informed systems which provide education training regarding traumatic stress for all professionals who may work with children and families (Cless & Nelson, 2017)."
"In the previous year the Senate passed a degree exempting PO from the usual age limit and experience of sub consular experience. o As such he was able to \u201cvigorously help undo Sulla\u2019s legislation by restroing the tribunes to their ancient powers\u201d Suetonius o What the Senate allowed him to do as consul proved disastrous to the state as he set dangerous precedents and made it harder for the Senate to control him Perhaps what was most devastating about this policy was that it illustrated how popular generals could bypass the rule of the Senate. The fact that they had granted powers to PO because they believed he had exceptional leadership qualities, gave the ambitious JC sufficient reason to challenge their rule and stop at nothing with the prime aim of gaining equality. o \u201cIt is no lie that JC was ambitious but what he desired most from the Senate was equality between himself and PO\u201d Cary and Scullard From the very beginning of his career the Senate showed inequity towards JC as he refused to break with his Marian connections."
"The cost of living is on a steady upward slope not only here in Canada but the rest of the world as well and many people are struggling to make ends meet in this world. Smaller towns usually have lower rent when it comes to apartments/homes but can often be more expensive when it comes to food and other services. Most people are paying monthly rent or monthly mortgage for the home in which they reside, along with groceries, families might have daycare costs, other bills, it is all a lot for two parents to pay for, let alone one parent. There are very few programs in place that are meant to help out parents with the financial burden of having children and the two main financial programs put in place to help parents are the same for single parents as it is married/common law parents. Of the few programs set in place in Canada made to help parents with children is subsidized daycare. Though there is subsidized daycare, there are a few hoops that must be jumped through in order to receive any sort of compensation. In order for parents to be able to receive subsidized care, the child must be in a specially recognized daycare. These daycares often have very long waiting lists, and the amount given in subsidization only covers a fraction of the monthly payments towards child care as long as the child in question fits the specific criteria. The availability of a spot in subsidized daycare and the fact that the child has to be in daycare for a certain number of hours in a month really takes away from the parents who really need the help of subsidized care. Being able to put a child in daycare and receive money to help pay for that would be nice, no matter if it was one of the ones on the list or not."
"Contemplating from yesterday\u2019s revelation, Villaruel finally came up to an idea. He wanted to save that place and the people of Bangalore. Seeing how Bangzom used them, it pained him a lot. From that day onwards, he made use of his medical skills and practiced his profession by curing them. Also, he established an institution for educating them and served as their teacher. And slowly, as years passed, zombies were getting better, able to communicate and somehow feel different emotions like a human does. They were now zompes \u2013 treated zombies who were able to adopt human behavior. Nothing is really impossible with great perseverance, this time Villaruel felt like a real hero."
"Cyber crimes are very prevalent in today\u2019s world and all actions that is required should be done to curb them. The current actions taken against the crimes are not enough and more should be done to address the problem as it posses a grave danger to the entire population of the world as it has the potential to influence political, social and economical wellbeing of communities, individuals and institutions. Protection of the self\u2019s interest can only be guaranteed through the concerted efforts of all stakeholders and nations in fighting the crime. References"
"In the fifth chapter of the book Cassie is forced to apologise to Lillian Jean simply for standing in front of her: \u201cYou can\u2019t watch where you going, get in the road. Maybe that way you wont be bumping into decent white folks with your little nasty self. \u201d Here, we can understand why Cassie longs for revenge. The spitefulness of Lillian Jean\u2019s words and the demands she makes upon Cassie are horrendous and unjustified. She makes Cassie feel so inferior to her simply because she is black, this is emphasised in the two contrasting words \u201cdecent\u201d and \u201cnasty. \u201d These words simply meaning white (decent) and black (nasty)."
"Indeed, the parameters on the rising trend in globalization are exceptionally impressive. Nonetheless, the rise in stocks of migrants are infinitely small compared to the rise in ratio of trade to gross domestic product as well as the ration of foreign capital to world capital stocks. The rise in migrant stock shares continue to remain small because of return and temporary migration continues to be common, thereby resulting to increased gross flows as compared to the net flows."
"I run down the boardwalk, not worrying about getting splinters in my tender feet. Every ten or fifteen feet I stop, sometimes to smell the salty sea air, but mostly to wait for my parents who plod along behind carrying chairs, coolers, and other beach paraphernalia. I yell back to them to hurry, and they reply that I can run ahead and find a good spot. I yelp with glee and run as fast as my little legs will carry me."
"The Australian Government did non hold many Aboriginal Rights until the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s. Before 1962. Autochthonal indigens did non hold the right to vote and four old ages subsequently. in 1966. hapless working conditions that applied solemnly to the natives were eventually protested and acknowledged. It was non until 1967 that the Commonwealth Referendum obtained permission to make new Torahs and rights sing autochthonal people. Some even believe. although extremely dubious. that the spread of new diseases by the Europeans was an effort at possible race murder towards the indigens."
"Additionally, this quotation presents Pilate to be acting laid back and trying carefully not to get wet, whereas Duffy shoes in the poem that the result of his actions are far dirtier, especially with \u201cThey seized the prophet and dragged him out\u201d which allows Duffy to illustrate that men live their lives in many ways without a conscience and therefore do not deserve sympathy as they do not give it out themselves. Duffy presents Pilate\u2019s wife as a bored Roman woman stuck in a foreign country with little to occupy her."
"In Sherry Turkle\u2019s TEDtalk entitled \u201cConnected however Alone?\u201d, she emphasizes the point that technology provides folks the facility to edit themselves and gift the simplest version of themselves. This seems like an honest issue. Good for applying for jobs, schools, and talking to new people. We will build ourselves appear additional fascinating and are available across as additional assured."
"These stages explore the maturity of the class and how their values change throughout the course of the year. When Braithwaite first begins teaching he is faced with racist comments and the uncooperative rudeness of his students. The teenagers refer to him as \u201ca new \u2018blackie\u2019 teacher\u201d. This illustrates the racial prejudice which existed in the East End of London at that time. The students are obnoxious to the person he is, all they see is the colour of his skin. Braithwaite experiences a cold attitude from his class, \u201cI begun to feel a bit uneasy under their silent, concentrated appraisal\u201d."
"By examining the relationship between the protagonist geroge and lennie , and the relationship between curly and his wife, this response will attempt to argue that indeed the only power others have over us , is the power we give them. this response will also attempt to examine techniques and description to make and shape meaning in the world of this novel.

"The Electoral Act of 1992 requires residence within a constituency as a requirement therefore disenfranchising travellers who continue there nomadic tradition In the Report of the Commission on Itinerancy in 1963 the government solution was to try to assimilate them into the settled community. Travellers felt this was a blatant attack on their culture. The report referred to them as being a problem that had to be resolved. Then in the Report of the Travelling People Review Body, 1983 finally acknowledged Prejudice, misunderstanding and harassment towards Travellers."
"In advanced welfare states, the abuse of mothers by their adolescent male children has been found to be prevalent (Hunter et al, 2010). However as Hunter el al claim, mother to child abuse remains a very under researched form of family and domestic violence and not much is studied about child to parent violence and usually it is the other way round. There are issues of stigma or shame when children are violent with their parents and studies on this usually focus on the interventions that could deal with anti social behavior and adolescent violence towards mothers is a prevalent issue. This brings in the different disciplines of youth justice,"
"We do not stop girls from playing with cars and boys playing with dolls, they require equal opportunities to develop the knowledge and skills they require in life. The SEN and disability act 2001/2 is an amendment of the education act 1996. The act is there to prevent discrimination against children with SEN or a disability in school and ensures them an education in mainstream school unless the parents request otherwise or it is incompatible with the education of the other children. This is seen in my setting as we are a nursery that accepts children with additional needs unless we feel that we cannot meet those children\u2019s needs without unrealistic changes to the setting."
"The established upper- and middle-class look down on the lower class and the up-and-comers. The result is miscommunication, suspicion, and conflict. Jack London was one of the leading naturalist writers of his time. In his essay \u201cWhat Life Means to me\u201d he describes his own experience as a working class youngster who toiled in a variety of jobs until finally he had enough of heavy labor and became a vagrant for a while (Baym et al. , 2008)."
"Also, besides they are illegal, they have to consume and spend money; so, the economy gains more with illegal immigrants inside the country than out of the country. Racism and fear of the foreign has likely been a part of cultural interaction since the earliest times of human civilization. However, in this modern time of widespread global communication and awareness and international mixing of people and cultures, it is increasingly vital to rid injustice and wrongful discrimination."
"Orang Asli is the collective term for the 19 sub-groups of `first peoples\u2019 in Peninsular Malaysia. Orang Asli are largely forest or agriculture based. On the contra, Orang Asli communities, especially in Southern Peninsular Malaysia, were well established before the reign of the Malay Sultans. Orang Laut groups even provided crucial military and economic support during the formation of the Johor and Malacca Sultanates. That the Orang Asli was part of the emerging Malay states can also be gleaned from the customary practices in some states. However, once politically autonomous and independent people are likeness of their ancestors. Much of this has to do with the fact that the Malaysian nation state does not recognize the Orang Asli as a separate people, that is as distinct groups associated with particular territorial bases and requiring `government\u2019 on a different basis from that of the other communities."
"One of the older boys stole jewelry and money, and the homeowner was sexually assaulted in her home later that day, but never saw her attacker. The assault was so brutal that she needed to have corrective surgery. One of the older boys had blamed the sexual assault on Joe. While being blindfolded, the woman listened to the Joe\u2019s voice to see if she recognized it and stated that it \u201ccould very well be\u201d him. Both of the older boys received short sentences in juvenile detention, while Joe Sullivan was charged and tried in adult court. Even though Joe was the youngest person in the country sentenced to die in prison for a non-homicide, his lawyer filed a brief on appeal saying there were no issues to challenge in his case. Joe was sent to adult prison when he was just fourteen, and he was repeatedly and brutally victimized by older inmates\u201d (Equal Justice Initiative). Joe, not only having to deal with a traumatic past of his home life and a mental illness, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair. The petition stating that this punishment is cruel and usual was denied."
"As a character Lady Capulet she is quite ambiguous and quietly blends into the background, with the exception of a couple sharp remarks \u201cHere comes your father, tell him so yourself; and see how he\u2019ll take at your hands\u201d. She just lets Juliet defend her self even though she is highly vulnerable at the moment. Also another observation of the relationship is that it is very impersonal and instead of addressing Juliet with warmth and love, Lady Capulet says \u201cmy daughter Juliet\u201d."
"Hurly-burly\u2019s done, When the battle\u2019s lost and won\u201d relating to the battle being fought by Macbeth and Macdonwald, they also talk about when the will meet next they mention here that they plan or at least know they are going to meet Macbeth there. The reactions of Macbeth and Banqou are very different this is because of the personalities so the witches show us more into two of the main characters personalities which gives the witches another reason that the witches have a large dramatic function in the first act, Macbeth\u2019s reaction helps us see into Macbeth\u2019s character."
"\u2018You can\u2019t keep a job and you lose me ever\u2019 job I get\u2019 \u2018You get in trouble. You do bad things I got to get you out\u2019 Although the men respect Slim he might be lonely because of his position and the way that nearly all the people that are on this ranch are outcasts in one way or another, and Slim seems to be the only one who is really a average guy that doesn\u2019t have anything holding him back, this might make Slim lonely. However, Stienbeck doesn\u2019t really tell the reader about Slim very much so we can only assume about Slim most of the time."

"According to the dictionary.com, \u2018stereotypes are as old as human culture itself.\u2019 Through media , the potential for stereo types to build are a definite possibility . When a person , especially one that is very young , is exposed to stereotypes of a specific group for the first time , then that person will assume all are that way . If the person continue to join with a group and received many negative things , then it will affect the overall opinions of that person . For an example , parents taught their children racist other races , then the children will be racist other races although they know it is wrong ."
"African oral traditions, nurtured in slavery, encouraged the use of music to pass on history, teach lessons, ease suffering, and relay messages. The African pedigree of African American music is evident in some common elements: call and response, syncopation, percussion, improvisation, swung notes, blue notes, the use of falsetto, melisma, and complex multi-part harmony. During slavery, Africans in America blended traditional European hymns with African elements to create spirituals. Many African Americans sing Lift Ev\u2019ry Voice and Sing in addition to the American national anthem, The Star-Spangled Banner, or in lieu of it."
"Authentic Happiness was a product of Dr.Seligman\u2019s study and exploration of Positive Psychology which was recently presented as a new branch of Psychology. For Seligman Positive Psychology delves into human emotions that might be considered positive, the features and characteristics of man that are considered his strong points, and healthy customs or traditions that help people focus on their life, happiness, and positive thoughts."
"Another argument against abortion is the fact they destroy the human potential that the child might have brought into the world if not for the abortion. The already existing child in the womb has the potential to develop in various ways and to accomplish certain things, and aborting the child absolutely nullifies these potentialities that the child could have."
"I think that racism is something that shouldn\u2019t happen and I think that it is crazy that people in the healthcare system would compromise their oaths as healthcare providers to favor one race over another. I also don\u2019t know if the program is really doing this or if there maybe isn\u2019t enough data to show that really there is just a coincidence that the people are from different races."
"At times, the phenomenon of considering the socially vulnerable classes to be completely expendable, almost akin to garbage and rubbish is all prevalent, and acts of violence against the poor are carried out by the rich, who prefer to hole themselves up in fortresses that cannot be violated by the socially deprived classes of human beings."
"Imagine going to the retail store in fear of people. For those who are affected by racial profiling, this is a common scenario. The essay \u201cJust Walk on By\u201d, by Brent staples is a perfect example. Staples showed a personal experience in his essay, which is that the one day he had to do a local news assignment and he went for an interview. Before the interview, he had some free time, so he went to a jewelry store to spend the time."
"However, crime punishment should not be imposed based on age if it is a crime that resulted out of deliberation. If an eleven year old was malicious enough to plot and commit murders of his parents or peers that same eleven year old should be punished as if he were 35. Perhaps if youths were exposed to the physical consequences of their actions the desire or idea to commit such crimes would yield deterrence. Americans and our criminal justice system would benefit from revisiting what is in the Nations best interest and resist pacifying those that insist perpetrators of violence be given the very rights to die peacefully which they violently stole from their victims. There will continue to be high crime rates as long as there is no deterrent; or certainty that swift, humiliating and painful justice will undoubtedly occur."
"Robert Hayden is one of the best-known American poets of his time. However, he is also one of the most underrated poets of all time, arguably not as much accolades as other poets of the same era. His poems exude admirable sincerity and tremendous grasp of poetic devices. His beautiful poem \u201cThe Whipping\u201d is regarded as one of his finest work. A biographical approach to the poem would reveal to us that Hayden transforms his bitter memories to a sumptuous work of art."
"We\u2019ve all received a sketchy email. Usually, the person sending the email is pretending to be someone you can trust such as your bank or your insurance company, in an attempt to get your username, password, credit card information, etc. This is known as a phishing attack. Phishing is an attempt to mislead someone into giving away sensitive information. In a phishing attack, an email, message, or another form of communication is used to create a facade that the sender is trustworthy, such as the CEO of your banking company or simply your insurance agent."
"The government should also not be as concerned with the number of cars involved in the school run, but more concerned with looking at their own policies which may have helped to create the increase in the number of cars involved in the school run. Instead of allowing children and parents to have such a free choice of schools, district regulations should be more strictly enforced and children should be promoted to go to their local schools."
"Industry versus inferiority: This is where most children begin formal education (what we call the school).\u00a0 For the first time children are being formally evaluated.\u00a0 If they raise their hand in class and answer a question correctly. then they will feel industrious (competent).\u00a0 If he tries to answer a question but stutters to get out the wrong answer and Matt Dunn, Nick Adams, and Josh Bieber all start making fun of his speech impediment, then he will feel inferior (it still hurts even today)."
"The disparities between these data may result from subjects\u2019 age, lifestyle, and urban/rural differences in the two studies. Both of these studies reported that Mexican-Americans required a higher degree of structure than did other groups. 3. SOCIOLOGICAL LEARNING STYLE elements are concerned with the social patterns in which one learns. Learning alone (as opposed to in groups) was preferred more by Caucasian students than by Mexican-American children (Dunn & Dunn, 1992, 1993) and more by Mexican-Americans students than by African-American children (Sims, 1988)."
"Firstly, we going to define what is merging? Merger of two or more organizations allows for the generation of cost synergies (administration, production, and listing costs), as well as greater geographical coverage (with a positive impact on revenues and the possibility of further growth).The second is through the merger of one or more companies into another company, with the result that the participating companies retain their identities. The purpose of a merger is of an economic/industrial nature."
"When one thinks of a cop the first thing that should come to mind is \u201chero\u201d. Law enforcement officers swear an oath, \u201cto protect and serve the citizens they represent.\u201d A representation of peace, power, justice, safety and much more. Although, a few years ago it was that way it is no longer true. But as time goes on people tend to want to avoid cops and hide from them."
"Everyone remembers their first job. It\u2019s a definitive time in your life: it\u2019s a step up from your childhood, and a preview of adulthood. It\u2019s a proud moment, when you are old enough to earn your own money. First job experiences are also formative. Not only do they teach you the value of hard work and money. They increase your self-confidence and self-sufficiency. The process to get this job wasn\u2019t easy."
"Like I said before, Brittney and I met in a Physical Science class that we had. That class contained an abnormal group of people. There were a lot of those student types that didn\u2019t care about school, much less class and then there were those that were class clowns who always thought they should have a minute or two to enlighten us with a joke everyday."
"There was so many kids and scary rides that really amazed me and some of them just seem crazy. One of the rides that I did not want to get on was the roller coaster. My reasons for roller coaster can be scary and is too high to the sky that it can cause me to get nervous. The amazing part about Six Flags is that it has some fun things and the good foods that I enjoyed with my sister. I had a good experience with this attraction and it was to see the rides that seems to be interesting and to have fun with these different rides."
"\u2022Achieving economic well-being \u2013 \u2018so that they engage in further education, employment or training on leaving school, are ready for employment, live in decent homes and sustainable communities, have\u00a0access to transport and material goods, live in households free from low income\u2019 Again, if a child or young person has been discriminated against at school they may not finish their education and not go on to achieve the grades they need to go on to further education or employment."
"Very few people are willing to say it and even fewer wish to acknowledge it but, there is even racism in our schools, the government, and the media. The government seems to be more confused on racism than any other thing. All of these affirmative actions are being considered and passed but, there are also a large number of anti-affirmative action laws that are being passed. According to the National Employment Lawyers Association, or NELA, we still need affirmative action for many reasons. According to NELA, women earn 71 cents for every dollar earned by men. For every dollar a white male makes, African-American men 72 cents, African-American women make 64 cents, and Hispanic women 54 cents. How much melanin is in your skin, is determined genetically. This is not something that you can change. Your skin color is determined based on your genetics and it should not have an effect on your life."
"According to the Encyclopedia or Urban America (1998), Miami currently has the largest percentage of foreign-born residents of any metropolitan area in the United States. With over half its population of Hispanic origin and more than one-fifth black, many from the Caribbean, Miami is multiculturalism. Immigrants, who choose to migrate in the city of Miami, are presented with the opportunity and the lifestyle of starting from the very bottom of the financial and social pyramid, work hard, and abide by the laws and regulations with the expectations of success and benefiting their families."
"Happiness frames a focal subject of Buddhist lessons. For extreme opportunity from affliction, the Noble Eightfold Path drives its specialist to Nirvana, a condition of everlasting harmony (Kwee 112). Extreme happiness is just accomplished by beating desiring in all structures. Progressively commonplace kinds of happiness, for instance, securing wealth and keeping up huge relationships, are moreover seen as admirable objectives for laypeople. Buddhism also empowers the age of treasuring generosity as well as empathy, the craving for the happiness and welfare everything being equal."
"In 2006 South Korea was the United States\u2019 seventh-largest trading partner and 1 lath-largest economy in the world. Park Chunk Hew\u2019s administration introduced across-the-board economic policy changes in the sass stressing exports and light industries. This lead to prompt debt financed industrial development. In addition, He, reformed their currency, strengthened their institutions for finance, and financial institutions, and presented an South Korea 1 1 economic development plan that was more workable for future growth. Manufacturing became an area they expanded on during the sass along with endorsing chemical, electronics and the automotive industry. As a result the manufacturing industry grew at a rapid pace into the sass (Economy, 2006)."
"\u201cMore important, 23.1per 1,000 babies under the age of 1 year suffer from child maltreatment higher than the odds of the children who die in car crashes. More than half the perpetrators are women where 48.8% are white, 20% are African American and 19% are Hispanic.\u201d (Psychology Today 2016) These results tell us that children who are babies are more likely to be victims of child neglect than a child that is old enough to talk. Effect of Neglect on the Brain In numerous instances of neglect, there has been a relationship with the mind neglecting to develop properly."
"As the child develops and begins to communicate, the cognitive skills emerge. They are reinforced with repetition as the child recalls how to do something. Perhaps you have noticed that a child will go back to the same puzzle or the same activity often. It\u2019s perfectly normal, and helps the child associate specific actions leading to specific results. Once the child feels successful with an activity, ask questions which directly relate to the activity. Which piece did you use first? Why? Allow the child to process the experience by describing his thought process."
"Even though Socrates\u2019 philosophy of life examination as a way of gaining the requisite self-understanding and realization has attracted significant acceptance, it has also elicited major debates in which people have contested this position. There is a section of those whose school of thought contradict the common belief that an unexamined life is not worth living. Part of the logic presented in such cases is that there is a lot more that contribute the wholeness of an individual\u2019s life, than the mere act of examination to determine the purpose and live to fulfil such purposes. Opining that the art of self-examination is an absolute route to self-realization and actualization is unrealistic, untrue, illogical and inadequate, this stand suggests that a person\u2019s happiness and overall well-being is actually a product of a more close-knight relationship with the environment, where each of the components plays a role."
"So, people in Afghanistan believe it is part of culture to marry a girl before age of 18th and not let her have a say, but they should consider that forcing a girl to marry cannot be regarded as cultural practice in any society. It is a violation of basic human rights. Therefore, women as part of society should be able to freely express their choices about their lifestyle desires. The video bellow is history of a 12 year girl who was forced into marriage. She ran away to break free from her in-laws, but unfortunately was arrested and in form of punishment by her husband (a Talib) she lost her nose and ear."
"This gang related short story \u201cOn the Sidewalk Bleeding\u201d relates to the theme of prejudice by exploring the idea of lost identity through group association. At the exposition of this story, Andy (a member of the \u2018Royal\u2019 gang) is stabbed by a rival gang (\u2018The Guardians\u2019) during a \u2018rumble\u2019. The plot then follows Andy\u2019s thought path as he slowly bleeds to death. \u201cThe knife had not been plunged in hatred of Andy. The knife hated only the purple jacket. The jacket was as stupid meaningless thing that was robbing him of his life. \u201d Andy wears a purple silk shirt, a symbol of his membership with the \u2018Royals\u2019."
"Some may say that they wouldn\u2019t have self-respect for themselves if they attempted to try and succeed at one of their goals and were not successful, that they would not have anymore self-respect for themselves because they didn\u2019t achieve there goal. Others might say that even though they failed, they would still have self-respect for themselves because they tried and were willing to try anything to achieve it. All in all self-respect gives everyone the definition of respect to them in there own terms and gives you a sense of accomplishment when you have self-respect. In many instances in my life I had to overcome some situations or strive forward to change who I am as a person."
"This article focuses on poverty and inequality, talking about how poverty puts people in the condition in which they may not make significant choices. Instead, we might expect terms like the guaranteed basic income or the bad income tax, in which we make people wealth and treat them with the pride their world entitles them to. Not just could it encourage those who are suffering get by, but rather than treating them like cultural degenerates, it could hope and enable them to create their personal financial decisions."
"This is a picture of New York. Without the dreams of living in New York they would have never made it out of Welch and away from their parents. New York pushed them to make a happy life for themselves and not to let their selfish parents use them any longer."
"When the whites came, Cooper through the characters he created contributes to the depiction on how Indians are treated outside the Frontier. The novel also showcases the weakness of the Europeans in their lack of understanding in the dangerous forest. At the very beginning, whites were expressive that they need Indians\u2019 expertise to invade the land. Indians are fierce and dangerous though but it is for them to continue their legacy and civilization. Their keen awareness of racism made them defensive."
"While having that spiritual exercise, I imagine myself as a child, I saw myself crying, and the reason of my tears is because of my stubborn hearts, because I allow myself to be influence by evil, and that\u2019s the reason why I\u2019m suffering during my childhood days, and at that moment, when I already hug the little boy, which is me, and be reconciled with him, I started also to cry like a child, and after that spiritual experience, I truly experience peace and happiness. By letting go of my past and be reconciled with it, I experience true happiness."
"Stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination are a part of everyday lives. A set of generalized beliefs and expectations about a specific group and its members is known as stereotyping. Stereotyping can often times lead to prejudice, a negative, or positive, evaluation of a group and its members. Common stereotypes and forms of prejudice involve racial, religious, and ethnic groups. Acting on these negative stereotypes results in discrimination which is a behavior directed towards individuals on the basis of their membership in a particular group."
"An important role in the story is taken by the story of the Boo Radley, who never leaves the house, thereby provoking children\u2019s fantasies. This whole story is shown by the author as a kind of game in which only children participate. With all the truths and crooks, they are trying to rescue a mentally ill person from the house, the whole district was afraid of. This house, shrouded in legend, was bypassed by all the inhabitants of the town. Here, Harper Lee determines the degree of ignorance of the entire population of Maycomb, which relies on wild superstitions and false beliefs. At the end of the novel, he will save the children from the murderer."
"When World War 2 broke out 400 000 Jews were forced into a sixteen block area called the Warsaw Ghetto. Irena was appalled by the conditions and decided she had to help make a change. With a group of friends Irena started forging documents to help the Jew\u2019s avoid getting caught by the Nazi\u2019s. Between 1939 and 1942 Irena and her friends were able to forge 3000 documents saving Jewish families from death. But Irena decided that she could do more for the Jew\u2019s. She joined Zegota an underground resistance force, fighting against the Nazi\u2019s. Irena was head of the children\u2019s department and began her work at once. Irena was a nurse so to get into the Ghetto she told the German\u2019s she was there to stop diseases spreading. She and ten other brave people went into the Ghetto to smuggle out the children. Irena said that the hardest part was getting the family to part with the child. \u201cCan you recall they will?\u201d Irena recalled the parents asking but she could only guarantee that if they stayed there, they would die. By the time Irena had smuggled 2500 Jewish children out of the ghetto and into foster homes the Nazi\u2019s became aware of her actions. She was captured and tortured although she never revealed anything to the Germans. She was sentenced to death but her friends at Zegota bribed the guards to let her go. She spent the rest of the war undercover but never stopped trying to help people in need."
"Some may argue that innocent children are happier in life because they do not know what it is like to be sad. Once one\u2019s innocence is taken away, they will never feel the child-like happiness of ignorance and evil. Shakespeare\u2019s play shows that one can be happy without experiencing tragedy, but they are not truly happy, and they do not appreciate the delightful times as much. Children may have happiness, but they do not truly appreciate it; they expect it. No one that has experienced hardships expects their lives to always be joyful and carefree like children do. When one that has experienced afflictions enjoys happiness, they are truly joyful and grateful for the joy and happiness they have."
"George Gallatin of quillette.com, sees the topic of open borders as an issue in a completely different light. Gallatin views open borders as an easy opportunity for mass immigration that could ultimately harm the culture and demographics of the home country. Gallatin supports his argument by claiming that mass immigration would lead to profound changes on our economics. \u201cThe open borders philosophy is wrong, because, like the failed ideologies of the past century, it doesn\u2019t account for unpleasant facts about human nature and society.\u201d (Gallatin) The author urges the importance of avoiding border although it might seem like the moral move. Another intriguing point Gallatin makes is the challenge of bringing together different cultures and how they will respond to each other. \u201cPeople from across the world differ significantly in behavior and custom. When migration occurs, we have to be aware that these behaviors and customs come along and can cause considerable strain in the receiving nation.\u201d(Gallatin) It is interesting to inmagine how welcoming or hostile a nation will be when accepting mass amounts of immigrants, especially when the country is already divided on the issue."
"This is a picture of Welch West Virginia where Jeannette Walls and her family lived together last. This is the place when things really started getting tough for Jeannette. Welch was the last straw for Jeannette and her siblings and being in Welch is what pushed them to get away from the not so great life their parents had provided them and for Jeannette and Lori to follow their dreams and make a happy life for themselves."
"Parenting is one of the biggest influences of children\u2019s behaviour. Some children are more likely to be competitive and goal-oriented and some are more likely to be rebellious and neglectful. Baumrind\u2019s (1971), classifications of parenting styles that influence children and adolescents behaviour. These three parenting styles are classified as authoritarian- parents who are often strict and harsh and focus on gaining a child\u2019s obedience to parental demands rather than responding to the demands of the child. Permissive- parents who place few restrictions, rules or limits on their children\u2019s behaviour. Authoritative- parents who are flexible and responsive to the child\u2019s needs but still enforce reasonable standards of conduct."
"Morgan (2007) argues that the decline in birth rates is due a rise in cohabitation as cohabiting couples often have fewer children than married couples. This piece of research is fairly new and can still be applied to modern situations, therefore, this point is not outdated. Another reason that has affected the decline of birth rates is the development of a geographically mobile workforce. Modern societies generally require a geographically mobile workforce. In the last century, workers were more inclined to stay with their family due to the privatization of the nuclear family. However, in modern-day society, nuclear families often encourage the children of the family to go find work elsewhere, therefore, a workforce that can move elsewhere for work or a promotion is needed. The children may leave the household as they need to be geographically mobile therefore this could shift the nuclear family into a smaller sized nuclear family. A factor that has affected birth rates in the United Kingdom is the compulsory education provided for children since 1880."
"The first factor; it is a behavior, it is the action of excluding, avoidance or distance oneself from other groups which according to Judith N, Martin and Thomas K. Nakayama in our book \u201cExperiencing intercultural communication: An introduction\u201d this is called discrimination. This term may be based on racism or any other \u201cisms\u201d; like sexism; related to a cultural group. The easy way to think about discrimination is that \u2018power plus prejudices equal \u201cisms\u201d \u2018(Martin & Nakayama, 2018)."
"Michael and Steven\u2019s relationship is further strengthened when Steven falls from a rescue chopper into a river and Michael immediately jumps in after him to save him. Cimino\u2019s use of an extreme wide shot as they plummet into the water amplifies the vacancy of their surroundings, showing that only Michael is Steven\u2019s last hope. Michael risks his own life to save the life of his friend, in stark contrast to how he acted when they were captured before. This time, Michael does not see Steven as baggage that he and Nick can leave behind when it comes to their own safety. He starts to think more with his heart, like Nick does, and make more impulsive decisions to help the people he is close to."
"Anthropologists tried to give answers as to the origin of the different races and the origin of man in general. They did not believe certain races were considered part of the human race because races such as American Indian were not mentioned in the Bible and therefore not considered to be human. They also believed Africans were not from the human species, but rather descendants of apes."
"This source is being used to help us further understand victimology and how it works within criminal profiling. Brent Turvey has experience within the criminal profiling field and gives much insight to ethical and legal issues, offender behaviors, and psychopathy. This source helps to fully pull everything together and backs up all other resources and findings as a whole which helps to solidify the paper to be most factual."
"Shortly after, people began to have sit-ins in areas marked for only whites at stores around the country. As more and more people began to contribute to the civil rights movement, the repercussion was just as substantial. The Freedom Riders were people who rode the interstate bus and challenged the courts rule over Morgan v. Virginia (1946) and other court rules that discriminated against African Americans. Martin Luther King used non-violent protests to fight back against the racism. In 1963, Martin Luther King was arrested for protesting in the streets of Birmingham, Alabama. While he was in jail, King wrote his famous letter Letter from Birmingham City Jail. President JFK then brought up legislation that led to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This made the government and oppressors very displeased with JFK.In the 1960s, Malcolm X and many other activists would be the leaders for the culture of the African Americans. Malcolm went against the mainstream civil rights act and encouraged Blacks to defend themselves by any means necessary. He began to start his own group as he would butt heads with the leader of the NOI (Nation of Islam). On February 21, 1965, Malcolm X was assassinated at a rally in New York. In 1966, Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panthers and in the next year they were able to publish a new article. They began to find success in rallies. Bobby Seale read statement of protest and this lead to him and 30 other armed Panther to be arrested. They were getting message out there, regardless of the consequence. It did not take much time for the Panthers message to spread, influencing others outside of California. In October of the same year, Huey Newton (the Defense Minister for the Black Panthers) was arrested for killing an Oakland cop. In retaliation, fellow Panther, Eldridge Cleaver starts a movement called Free Huey. Following those events, former chairmen of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Stokely Carmichael joins the party and eventually becomes the Prime Minister. Carmichael denies whites to enter the Black Panther because he says they only want to have power over those in the party already. Carmichael states that, Whites who come into the black community with ideas of change seem to want to absolve the power structure of its responsibility for what it is doing, and say that change can only come through black unity, which is the worst kind of paternalism. In the following year, J Edgar Hoover and the FBI launch a program called the COINTELPRO. Their purpose was to disband any revolutionary groups in America. J. Edgar Hoover claims that the groups are the biggest threat to the internal security of our country. These groups included the Poor People\u2019s March,"
"However, the stereotype of urban Mexican Americans takes over and Honest Sancho mentions that Johnny has an arrest record that was brought about by the poor educational and economic opportunities, stating \u2018Well he learned it in your school'(Valdez 961). After Johnny attempts to steal Miss Jimenez\u2019s purse, she passes stating\u2019 We can\u2019t have any more thieves in the state administration, put him back'(Valdez 962)."
"Aside from the way I present myself, my classroom setting has to be structured in a way that is acceptable as well. In the Muslim world they do not eat pork, or have anything to do with pigs; so finding an alphabet, and reading or singing songs about a farm has to be planned and alter to fit the culture inside the classroom."
"The following men have brought light to the overshadowed meaning of political courage. He is known as \u201cMr. Republican\u201d the reason why I choose him was that on more than one occasion he chose to speak out in defense of a topic no politician with his ambitions would have come from a Republican. Robert A. Taft is described as a man who \u201cWas known in the Senate who never broke an agreement, who never compromised his deep-felt Republican principles, who never practiced political deception.\u201d Even though his actions did not change history it was courageous because he spoke out when no other Republican did so. After all, it was the right thing to do. In October 0f 1946, Taft who was known to speak his mind would have guarded his tongue during this time because of how drastic this issue was, refusing to keep silent on this issue proved that he stood by his morals and The Constitution. During this time the United States Supreme Court was deciding on a life in prison or the death penalty for ten Nuremberg Nazis. Taft endured a large amount of hatred from the public since the death penalty was expected for people like Nazis. In life, we have multiple viewpoints, and I Believe that Taft\u2019s course of action was to influence the public to not seek vengeance by responding to hate with more hate. Taft does exemplify political courage because, in a tough situation like the presidential election, he decided to stick to his morals and his beliefs as a Republican to stand by the United States Constitution and be a spokesperson not to Americans, but our enemies. The governments shall not have the right to pick and choose which laws to enforce especially in a dilemma such as Nuremberg Nazis. He risked, and lost the election but continued to be respected among other political faces."
"In Kenya, a living elephant is worth around $14 375 for every year of its life whilst the ivory from an elephant is worth about $1000. Each elephants herd earns as much as $610 000 each year. This promotes the maintenance of the elephants, minimises poaching and ensures protection of wildlife as well as livelihood for the people. Another area, the Serengeti Plains, is famous for the migration of wildlife. The national park attracts large numbers of tourists, who are attracted to the large migration of wilder beasts, cats and zebras. This experience encourages travel to the area and highlights an appreciation\u00a0for the ecosystem. In all these encounters, education is a characteristic of the various tours."
"Today I am going to talk about \u2018Respecting the environment\u2019. When we talk about the environment we mean everything in the world around us that surrounds and affects all life on earth, including the air, food chains, the water cycle, plants, animals and other humans. The oxygen we breathe comes from our environment,"
"The wages of both domestic skilled and immigrant labor are flexible and experts estimates that undocumented unskilled workers are earning less money in compared to the American adults working the same number of hours. Thus, the wages of immigrants can fall below the legal floor. More simply stated, the unskilled immigrants ends up taking the less prestigious job and are getting paid less than compared to what their skills are.People in the United States interprets the undocumented immigrants in two competing ways. One is the popular image of immigrants as culprits, powered by a handful of studies and advanced by those calling for restrictions on immigration. The other way is a common sense recognition of illegal immigrants as contributors to the U.S. economy, as estimated by many economists. Those calling for restrictions on immigration claims they pose a huge threat to the taxpayers. Those claiming argues that immigrants have a fiscal impact on the public sector, and estimates that immigrants consume more in public services, such as health care, infrastructure, education, thea they contribute in taxes. The popular image of immigrants have been such that people are not ready to believe the way economists have to think. \u201c Immigrants are generally understood to contribute more in taxes than they consume in public services\u201d (Hing 78). They are proved to be more motivated to success, of young age and dynamic towards their work. They are a self-selected group saturated with work ethic, having a few children and come without any age factors, and thus producing more than what they consume. Of course one might not completely agree to the fact that all immigrants are motivational workers. But regardless of all the concerns, the fact is that most immigrants are young, of working age, and motivational workers towards success. Throughout its history, United States of America has been a land of immense opportunities. It is a dream of many to reside in this great nation. While some manage to do so, few of them reside illegally."
"From the beginning of time everyone has always had that one person in his life that he admires. Being a mom and raising six kids is not an easy thing to do, but somehow my mom has managed to accomplish this big task God has given her, These three characteristics that my mom possesses perfectly describe the way she lives today. My mom Shirley 7 known as Mamma Shirl by close friends \u2014 is the person I most admire because she is supportive, loving, and hard- working."
"However, this could be too harsh an analysis. It could be argued that Curley is just as lonely as the rest of the ranch men and that the only way he can gain a semblance of respect from the other men is to prove that he is powerful. During the incident with his hand his tough exterior melts, revealing his true personality. We are told that, \u201che stood crying.\u201d This is a vast dissimilarity to his previous behaviour. Through this presentation Steinbeck proves that he is nowhere near as tough as he makes himself out to be."
"A stereotype is a trait of one or more people that is attributed to a social or racial group. In the novel an example of a stereotype is when Gary is talking about how he and Pickles had never been to the Point before because they both had heard stories that there were \u2018Abo\u2019s\u2019 with spears and boomerangs being thrown everywhere."
"In their research, the targeted research population was manufacturing and service firms in the UK. They found that top management support, non-accounting ownership, adequate training provided to ABC determined the ABC success. Besides behavioral, organizational and technical variable, some researchers also indicated that the dimensions of national cultures could affect the level of ABC success [32, 33]. Brewer [32] used Hofstede\u2019s taxonomy of work-related cultural values to examine the relationship between national culture and Activity-Based Costing system."
"In order to achieve tangible progress, activists need a clear message and a unified group. In the civil rights movements of the past, this meant organizing marches and rallies. Gathering like-minded individuals to join together and express a common concern is paramount to achieving change. The need to gather and organize has not changed, but the way in which masses assemble is the interesting difference between civil rights movements of the past when compared to #blacklivesmatterr Individuals have much more of a global voice than they did 50 years ago."
"The death rate when a gun is used is much higher than when knives or other weapons are used during an attack. Household brutality assaults involving guns are twelve times more likely to bring about fatalities than those without guns. These facts are nothing new. Shooters generally shoot to kill, and, even if they shoot to maim or warn, the unpredictable trajectory of bullets can still kill. The more instruments of demise and harm we remove from our social norms, the more secure we will be."
"In a Depression everybody suffers. If you were black or disabled you suffer even more because nobody would want to employ you. Employers want white, fit and young workers, if they were fit to get that job, it would be low payed, you would suffer either way, but if you was black or disabled you would be less likely to get that job, Candy only got that job because he lost his hand under their behalf. Crooks only got that job because he\u2019s been there a long time and he\u2019s got skill. If Crooks and Candy were kicked and had to start again, it wouldn\u2019t be easy for them to get another job."
"In order to address the problems in regulation of online environment more effectively, this paper aims to focus on several most problematic aspects of the issue \u2013 copyright violations, child pornography and identity theft or credit card fraud. Defined by Culberg, copyright is \u201ca legal device giving the author (or holder of the copy\u00adright) the exclusive right to control the reproduction of his or her intellectual creation\u201d for a specific period of time.[15] Copyright law in the United States derives from the U.S. Constitution and is therefore exclusively federal; states do not have the authority to legislate in this area.[16] Defenses to a charge of criminal copyright infringe\u00adment are, first, that the offense cannot be prosecuted be\u00adcause the five year statute of limitations has run.[17]"
"As the poet is an adult, he can see beyond the grasshopper \u2018incident\u2019 and into a easy realisation, but the child in the poem struggles to go beyond, and is still in the process of learning in hope to understand nature. In this fourth section, we see an emotion shift of guilt to betrayal displaying this confusion. We can again see the use of diction, and the imperative tone; \u201cHe must not have tears torn from him by petty trickery\u201d, which shows the defensive approach to the grasshoppers tricks. We are then finally presented with another form of sensory imagery putting the reader in the shoes of the child \u2013 shoes which very evidently resent the previous feelings of sadness and guilt; \u201cHe could snatch the creature up and shatter it for leaving him so naked\u201d. It is moving, and significant in creating the insect as the \u2018creature\u2019 needing to be killed. In context we can see that the boy doesn\u2019t like this feeling of guilt for nothing, and so this image allows the reader to connect to this harsh, sudden feeling of hatred by using \u2018snatch\u2019 and \u2018shatter\u2019, as readers we connect this resent and revenge to betrayal."
"During this visit, Nel walked in on Sula and Jude \u201cdown on all fours naked\u201d with nothing touching \u201cexcept their lips right down there on the floor\u201d. Sula had sexual intercourse with her own best friend\u2019s husband. Morally is it right not to sleep with someone else husband but Sula was only thinking about pleasuring herself at the moment and not the value of friendship her a Sula have. Only focusing on one\u2019s else can cause a person to be disloyal to people that are close to them. Jude is a man that isn\u2019t judged as much as the betrayal between Sula and Nel because men have more power so actions they take doesn\u2019t really affect them. Betrayal leads to the death of friendship because of sexual intercourse."
"Winston Churchill once said: \u2018We make a living by what we get; we make a life by what we give .\u2019 In conclusion, giving is like a boomerang, you may throw it really far, but in time it will always come back to you. Personally I feel that giving, no matter how little or how large will always result in the same way, both sides, the giver and the receiver will both be cheerful."
"\u2019 (10, 286-290) This shows not only the valued trait of bravery, but it shows loyalty and friendship that e would knowingly risk his life to save his crewmembers. Although this book was originally written thousands of years ago, it shows trust and friendship to be just as important as it is now perceived in today\u2019s world. 12 Angry Men only got past 5 pages because of the fact that Juror 8 trusted the defendant enough to at least give him a fair chance. The first vote count for guilty/not guilty was 11 to 1 in favor of guilty, based solely on observations and the race of the accused party. The other Jurors didn\u2019t trust him because of their personal prejudice."

"6.1. FIRST ARGUMENT Death penalty is a necessary evil that serves as deterrent to reduce crime rate. Everybody fears death, even animals. If extreme criminals are executed by death penalty, all the potential criminals will definitely think twice before committing extreme crime because their own life is at stake. Majority of studies claimed that the existence of death penalty increases the crime rate but some of the studies did not consider other factors that affects crime rate. For example, the major factors that constantly contributing to an increase of crime rate are residential population, individual family issue, climate and economic condition (Annual Crime Report 1998). Moreover, all the matters regarding deterrence has been studied by a Professor of Jurisprudence named Ernest van den Haag from Fordham University. He stated that even though statistical demonstrations are not conclusive, capital punishment deter more than other punishments because people fear death more than anything else (Arguments for and Against the Death penalty 2000)."
"In the most recent Prime minister election Mark Rutte\u2019s centre- right VVD won. The Dutch citizens as well as all other EU members saw this as a victory for the EU. Many saw this result as a victory fir democracy and against extremism and many believed that it was a very \u2013 pro european result. This victory also had positive affects on other members of the EU such as France and Germany. Germany wo seats in parliament and france was to elect a bew president with the right national front forecast to increase its votes thanks and these are both thanks to the victory."
"The images of the women portrayed in the novel are strong and very independent when it comes to field works. Dalin showed how strong she is when it comes to challenges. She had been through a lot of challenges in life that tested her patience and strength. Orang, Blas\u2019 daughter also showed strength when she was took advantage by the Spanish officials. Despite of what happened to her, she remained strong. Mayang, Ba-ac\u2019s wife also showed strength when Ba-ac died. She is also independent when it comes to her works in the village. These women were not respected by the Spanish officials that time. That time, they were inferior to the eyes of these officials."
"This song is both art and activism. I see it as art because it is has a unique sound that is different than other popular songs on the radio. It is also art because it makes people feel something. Even those who cannot understand or do not relate to the topics of this piece can still feel a certain way. As an artist, Beyonc\u00e9 challenges many topics that need to be discussed and she does it in such a way that is beautiful to see and hear. It is also activism because she uses her art to shed light on the current problems that the African American community faces."
"Human beings and animals always had an important relationship. Animals were created to provide us with food and guide us when we had problems. In that story the animals help the man find the food and he has to share it with them in return. They also helped him find his way in the forest. Animals and humans combined together have a great power and they were able to achieve great things. God gave us the power to rule over the world that he has created for us but unfortunately we abused of this power."
"This paper will summarize the movie Glory and relate one or two characters to Aristotle, Epictetus, and Saint Augustine on character, dignity, and self-respect. Alina Campbell This paper will summarize the movie Glory and relate one or two characters to Aristotle, Epictetus, and Saint Augustine on character, dignity, and self-respect. The movie Glory is based on a true story about the Commander of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry which was the first black regiment to be listed in the service of the United States."
"Hellena is the perfect example of one throwing off inhibitions and revealing her inner self behind the guise of a mask. Slated for the convent in an effort by her father to consolidate the family finances, she decides that this carnival will be the time she finds a man \u2013 and she sets her sights on one as daring and quick-witted as herself. She is able to track him in different disguises and at one point sets out to \u201cvex\u201d him for his keeping with Angellica. She shows herself to be a strong, independent-thinking woman in an age when women had few personal rights. The carnival setting is the\u00a0vehicle that gives her the freedom to behave in the manner she does."
"This is the old habit, the old blood which he has not been permitted to choose for himself, which has been bequeathed to him willy nilly and which had run for so long (and who knew where, battening on what of outrage and savagery and lust) before it came to him. I could keep on, he thought. I could run on and on and on and never look back, never to see his face again. Only I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t\u2026 (433). The reader can sense his desperation. The child is so desperate for a way out, but the loyalty to his father overwhelms him. Ms. Johnson of \u201cEveryday Use\u201d expresses a similar sense of loyalty."
"We can tell that Piggy is really scared when Golding uses the words \u201ccried\u201d and \u201cterror\u201d to describe the scene in the book. Piggy seems to feel pain and is really afraid of what Jack could do to him especially with the loss of his sight. Piggy\u2019s glasses are also a symbolic representation of intelligence on the island."
"Curley\u2019 wife feels apprehensive because of the solitude she feels and it is made clear she is exasperated with this condition, \u201cnone of them care how I gotta live. \u201d Nonetheless, the reader is presented with a side to an apparently playful and occasionally vindictive character. In chapter 5, Steinbeck permits Curley\u2019s Wife\u2019s character to eloquent emotions of loneliness, \u201cI get lonely\u201d and \u201cI get awful lonely\u201d. The use of repetition is used to give emphasis to the remoteness and frustration of not being able to talk to \u201cnobody but Curley\u201d, her hindrance which incessantly exteriors as she speaks to Lennie."
"There are several ways to show your love and affection to your friend, it can be through teasing and caring for them. A true friendship and genuine love do not brag with each other. There is no competition among friends, it doesn\u2019t matter who is successful or not. What is important is you look at each other\u2019s back. Love starts with friendships and friendship develops into love. But in some cases, love can destroy a friendship. With friendship as a foundation, two individuals might develop passion for each other. They can be friends that turn into lovers."
"I understand that as finding ways to end institutional racism and raising awareness of ideologies that will end prejudices. Until I attended Loyola I had a naive impression of racial awareness. Personally, I believe education is the key to combating racism. We must education our peers on our cultures. We must explain that \u201ccolorblindness\u201d in society is not what\u2019s best. Only by embracing and recognizing each other differences we will be able to break the social bubbles we live in. I\u2019ve gained a stronger sense of racial awareness through this course."
"Lennie sure is stupid, earlier he was carrying a dead mouse just to pet it. I dont know what i\u2019m gonna do with him every time he gets upset I have to tell him that dumb story about the house where we will have rabbits and an alfalfa patch and he can pet the stupid rabbits. Who knows maybe one day that dream might come true but I don see that day coming soon."
"Thematically, a reader sees the detrimental effects of memory in the form of Amanda\u2019s living in the past. As far as the play\u2019s presentation is concerned, the entire story is told from the memory of Tom, the narrator .When he begins to speak in Scene 1 of The Glass Menagerie, one of the first things he tells the audience is, \u201cThe play is memory. Being a memory play, it is dimly lighted, it is sentimental, it is not realistic.\u201d The influence and power of memory is an important theme in the play and influences all the characters, which are trapped by memory. Tom is haunted by the memory of deserting his sister."
"In current times, the death penalty can no longer be claimed as an efficient form of retribution. There are huge delays in carrying out the executions of an inmate. Statistics show that there is over an eight-year wait before an execution can take place. In fact, most death row inmates die of old age, before their execution sentence. California\u2019s death row is a great example. Since 1976, only thirteen inmates have been executed. Currently there are around seven hundred inmates in California\u2019s death row. If the trend continues, that would mean most of the inmates would die of natural causes before their execution sentence can be carried out."
"The creative activity of Chlorofluorocarbons must be placed in the context of a policy and be aftering broader model that is captured by a probationary set of standards, proposed to measure how well metropoliss meet children\u2019s demands and to inform CFC policies and plans. Harmonizing to these standards, a CFC includes:"
"A gay Filipino man was reportedly beaten on several occasions by his partner, a white U.S. citizen, who was reportedly addicted to drugs and alcohol. When police responded to one altercation, they reportedly arrested the Filipino man and threatened to report him to immigration authorities, saying: \u201cYou\u2019re not a citizen. We should deport you, you shouldn\u2019t be hitting Americans; you\u2019re not an American.\u201d The Filipino man was sentenced to 52 weeks of batterer\u2019s intervention in court (Amnesty International USA, 2010)"
"First of all, it is believed that one must suffer unhappiness to truly know and appreciate happiness. However, that concept is incompatible with a utopia, as the point of a utopia is to be without sadness, pain and suffering. In that respect, the World State is a utopia. Secondly, the concept of knowing unhappiness to know happiness is what we have in our society. Let me ask you: are you truly happy? Maybe you are, but what if I told you that that was not true happiness."
"I haven\u2019t written to you in ages. This is because life has been so great. I am still Daisy Renton and I am still with Eric, well was. See the thing is not only have I split up from Eric, but I am also pregnant with his child. I love him so much. We barely spent a day apart. Once I told him I was pregnant he didn\u2019t want to know. He offered me money and I took it. He offered me more but when I asked him where it was from, it turned out to be stolen. So I refused anymore. I don\u2019t know what I am going to do. Again. I think I will have to find an alternative solution to running away this time. After all I have a baby to think of. But I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t bring up a child alone. Why me? It\u2019s always me. I can\u2019t cope anymore. I t is rejection after rejection. I can\u2019t go on living like this."
"Another form of communicating with a child or young person may be more social situation that may occur in break or lunch periods that you are supervising, but in these situations again you need to be mindful of how much information you share in your context. Children, young people and adults do like to get to know you as well as you them so you may find that they ask a personal question in communicating."
"Integration, according to Professor Tariq Modood, is \u201cwhere processes of social interaction are seen as two-way, and where members of the majority community, as well as immigrants and ethnic minorities, are required to do something; so the latter cannot alone be blamed for failing to or not trying to integrate\u201d (Modood, 2011: 4)."
"A servant leader is someone who looks to the needs of the people and asks how they can help them to solve problems and promote personal development. They place their main focus on people, because content and motivated people are able to reach their targets and to fulfill the set expectations. This has a direct connection to being an effective Air Force officer. High quality leadership is critical in order to accomplish the mission and succeed in motivating soldiers to perform at the peak of their personal ability level. It is important to avoid complacency and continually strive for excellence."
"In the film, there is another world that is also explored in which the individual connects with family and culture. It is a world where everyone is connected despite their differences, it is the real world with real emotion, real passion and real feeling. Fran has a place in this world with her culture and family. In this case, when Scott chases after Fran he meets her family living on the outskirts of town possibly implying that they are outsiders. However, the roles are reversed. Fran is now somewhere she belongs, and Scott is excluded due to various barriers including language barriers and cultural differences. Scott is humiliated as he doesn\u2019t perform the Paso Doble correctly due to the fact that he dances with the desire to win. As a result of not belonging he is taught by Fran\u2019s family to dance from the heart to express authentic feeling. His instinct tells him he needs to belong with this world, in order to express his individuality."
"I believe that Tribal group is a very green and strong company to work for as they take care of their staff to ensure good quality of life at work and they are also developing and adapting to the future and technology. Customers and their data are crucially protected. I believe to follow all the laws and procedures tribal must hire the correct staff in all aspects and with the great expanding team we have now we will be able to overcome any threat or weakness."
"As citizens of the United States we are entitled to our civil rights. They include our basic needs for living a happy and safe life. Animals however are not entitled to any rights to ensure them safety, good health, and proper living conditions. Animal testing laboratories torture and kill innocent animals daily. The laboratories smell of chemicals and bleach, and the cages are dirty, and not properly kept. The horrible smells fill their nostrils and they are forced to walk in their own urine and feces."
"She concluded in a paper subsequently published in the British Medical Journal that almost a third of births could be the consequence of accidental pregnancies. If this were the case it would mean 310 000 accidental pregnancies in Britain every year. In fact, this is likely to be a conservative estimate. Because Anne Fleissig conducted her research into the circumstances in which women\u2019s new babies were conceived, her sample did not include women who had conceived but ended the pregnancy by an abortion."
"Protections against cyber-crimes The enactment of laws against cyber crime by the governments has been a move in the right direction. In US there are such laws as; Computer Abuse and Fraud Act that address issues of fraud that is related to computers, SPAM act that is intended to at controlling assaults of non solicited pornography. Other laws address extortion threats, identity theft, wire fraud, electronic communications privacy, and secrets of trade (Thomas, 2000). Legal frameworks that address each emergent form of cyber-crime should be made."
"This ties in to the mice in the story, but more broadly refers to the tragedy of causing discomfort with excellent intents. There are numerous methods to look at this verse and how it includes to the inevitability: the mice refer to weak individuals, such as Lennie, Crooks, and Sweet, and men describe strong people, like George and Slim, the book is a story of weak and strong individuals. Steinbeck wrote Of Mice and Men at a time when he was ending up being associated with California\u2019s social and financial issues. John Steinbeck lived throughout the Great Depression years, a time in which numerous people were at or listed below the hardship line."
"\u201cI\u2019ll kill the big son-of-a-beach myself. \u201d (page 109) He is more furious because that \u201chuge\u201d guy broke his possession than his wife is dead. The only man who is not afraid of Curley and his wife is Slim. Introduced by Steinbeck using a narrative description, he is \u201cthe prince of the ranch\u201d (page 37) who is respected by everyone. He symbolizes the leader \u2013 that a few men who are very skilled, have a great authority and a good understanding of the way in which life and death work. His attitude to women is more calmly and relaxing that the other men on the ranch. He greets Curley\u2019s wife with \u201cHi, Good-lookin\u2019\u201d."
"With in the same article it preached, \u201clet us not perpetuate the myth that \u2018minorities\u2019 and women cannot compete without special preferences\u2026vote for fairness not favoritism.\u201d The fairness of Proposition 209 has been hotly debatably ever since it was enacted in 1997, but I think the dinner scene with Derek and his father in American History X most succinctly sums up the mindset of the many supporters of Proposition 209. The scene opens with a dinner table conversation between Derek and his father about the material he is learning for his English class. His father than expresses his distaste for such material with the following monologue:"
"Some gemstones are named because of where they where mined like Tanzanite was mined in Tanzania and the Burma ruby was found in Burma. Some gemstones are named by who first discovered them. Some minerals are given the name that\u2019s the same as the gemstones, like the mineral is called diamond and the gemstone is called diamond. Although most minerals have different names then the gemstones. Such as the mineral Beryl is called Emerald as a gemstone. Some minerals make up several gemstones, such as Quartz it could be Amethyst (purple Quartz), Citrine (yellow Quartz), or it could be Smoky Quartz (brown Quartz). Or like the mineral Corundum which makes up the gemstones Ruby and Sapphire."
"Conversely, is a person without a job always at leisure? Musicians, professional athletes, and the homeless are all specific examples of situations that may help answer these questions. Leisure Defined as Time Leisure defined as time may be the most commonly understood meaning of the word today because of its positive connotations (Martin, 1975). People often use the word leisure and the term free time interchangeably. On the surface this definition seems fine, but as you delve deeper and ask difficult questions, it starts to become less clear. What is free time?"
"Art is for anybody. I want to be an art teacher because I believe that I can influence children to create their own piece of amazing art work. When I was in pre-school, I had this amazing teacher who inspired me to do anything I wanted to. Her name is Ms. Linda and she inspired me to become an art teacher when I am older. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I have had plenty other amazing teachers, but I think she was the one who told me to fly."
"Juliet wishes that her mother could delay the marriage or she can prepare her deathbed, \u2018 Delay this marriage for a month, a week, Or if not, make the bridal bed. In the dim monument where Tybalt lies\u2019. She wishes so doesn\u2019t have to marry Paris and escape to Mantua to be with Romeo. Juliet eventually pleases her father by saying that she will marry Paris; she fools them all and takes a potion from Friar Lawrence, which makes her seem dead. Lord Capulet is pleased that Juliet has finally comes to her senses that he has choose the perfect man for her to marry. After Juliet commits suicide, I saw that Juliet does have a close and loving relationship with Lord Capulet, in the end he pushed her into suicide by bringing the wedding forward in thought that it would make her happy, this is tragic irony."
"The Equality Act 2010 comes into enforcement as in correspondence with the law that is protecting all children, young people and practitioners from any act of discrimination within the workplace environment and out within the wider society and the different environments that we all live within. However, this piece of legislation has replaced the former anti-discrimination laws where it has become one single Act."
"The article discusses a survey of linguistic communication schools in Southern California for the kids of Chinese and Korean immigrants, where they are learning their parents \u2018 linguistic communications and civilization, such as traditional art, athletics and dance. The schools besides offer tutoring in school topics, high school aptitude trials and college entryway tests."
"This paper will explore the topic of family counseling and how it helps people to deal with and overcome the struggles of life. Family counseling differs from individual counseling because the perspective is different. It is a type of psychotherapy that teaches people how to cope. The sessions are usually short-term, but depending on the family\u2019s situation, it could be prolonged."
"Richard Lynn discusses that there are distinctive group differences in capacity that are somewhat accountable for constructing race and gender group differences in wealth (Lynn). Culture and religion are believed to play a part in constructing inequality by encouraging or discouraging wealth-acquiring behavior, and by giving a basis for discrimination. Certain racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to be poor depending on the country that the individual belongs to. Another cause includes cultural differences between different races, an educational success gaps, and racism."
"Nowadys, indicators have become technologically advanced and can be used for the main purpose of indicating whether something is acidic, basic or neutral. This is possible because in solutions of different pH, the colour of the inidcator will change simultaneously with pH change. This is made possible by pigments in the indicators. Hand made indicators include universal indicator, methyl orange, phenolphthalein and many more."
"Contrary to the perception of most people, migration has been an opportunity for international integration and development rather than a threat. The business corporation world has changed divested in its core objective of making profits to pursue the triple p mantra of people, profits and planet. Businesses focusing on people and planet pursued sustainability initiatives and these have become the integral features among businesses globally. Migration in globalized world is fueled by the need to dissipate and distribute skills and resources. For instance, investors are moving into the outskirts of financially concentrated regions to invest elsewhere (Fortunati, ; Pertierra, 2011). The number of investors moving from commercial hubs such as New York and London to emerging and developing economies in Asia, Africa, South America and Europe is astounding."
"I do not come from a rich family nor is my family poor. However, my family did have to struggle sometimes because my mother was single parent raising 4 kids on her own with help from my grandmother. They both made sure me and my siblings had everything we need. College was a turning point because I am the youngest and the last to go to school. With my mother being a single parent, she didn\u2019t have much help money-wise to help put all her kids through school."
"According to the United Nations, about 200 million between 2006 and 2010 across the globe were living in a foreign country different from where they were born (UN Chronicle). Certainly, this absolute number has increased over the years but world migrants in 2010 represented about 2.5% of the global population. These statistics, nevertheless, do not reflect the dramatic increase in world migration as a result of globalization. This is because there is a myopic conception that migration to the less developed nations have reduced significantly in stock. However, the stocks of migrants in developed worlds increased between 2006 and 2010 from 3.1% to 4.5% (UN Chronicle). Dramatic increase in global migration was phenomenal in North America, Australasia and Western Europe registering 4.9 to 7.6% increase (UN Chronicle)."
"to actualize their love and does everything he could do to ensure he wins the love of Christine. Erik performed the role of a phantom very well as he did inhuman things to ensure his mission accomplishes (Francis & Leroux, 2007). A phantom character is not for easy hearted and Erik acted very well to bring out the picture of a phantom. Christine on the other hand made sure no matter the threats from the phantom her love for Raoul could not be moved. She stood her ground until the phantom obliged to her love. These two characters undertake their roles very well and keep viewers yearning for more."
"Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities are without a doubt, disconcerting, and Europa\u2019s Conservative party intends to hold the country accountable for any potential use of these weapons, as well as to take preventative measures to ensure that Iran cannot further its nuclear agenda. The United States has decided to employ military prowess in Iran as a result of concerns that the usage of nuclear weapons was imminent. While the Conservative party should not send Europan troops into Iran, it does not condemn the decision by the United States to do so. Any deal made with a volatile country such as Iran is subject to distrust on many ends, the Conservative party believes that JCPOA was a reckless decision. Still, because it is being internationally enforced, Europa should neither reprimand the United States, nor violate the terms of the deal. (Iran nuclear deal: UK won\u2019t walk away, says Boris Johnson.) Instead, it should take a more neutral stance. On the surface, it will be neutral. Iran is hostile towards the West, however, as well as Israel, a major ally of both the United States and Europa, meaning that although Europa should take a neutral stance on the surface, it implicitly should support the United States, and if Iran wreaks havoc, Europa should intervene."
"But how does racism really affect society? Visibly identifiable members of racial and ethnic oppressed groups continue to struggle for equal access and opportunity, particularly during times of stringent economics. Often, the targeted race has a harder time doing things such as finding a well-paying job or house. While there have been some sizeable gains in the labor force status of racial minorities, significant gaps remains. Racism is rampant in all areas of employment. For many members of exploited racial and ethnic unit, there is always an economic depression. Studies show that people of color are the last hired and the first fired. As a result, budget cuts, downsizing, and privatization may disproportionately hurt people of color. In February 1995 the unemployment rate for African Americans was 10.1 percent as compared to 4.7 percent for white Americans (Berry, 1995). The unemployment rate for adolescents of color is approximately four times that of white adolescents. What\u2019s more, In America, the Majority of unemployed men are black, and compared to other races, Blacks and Latinos on average have disproportionately low income."
"Racism and police brutality have been largely discussed by the public in recent years. Through my research on racism and police brutality in the U.S. I found two reliable sources through the use of Google Scholar. The first, \u201cRacial Profiling and Use of Force in Police Stops: How Local Events Trigger Periods of Increased Discrimination\u201d from Yale University, was written by Joscha Legewie. This journal focused on the rise in police brutality following acts of extreme violence by examining data from police traffic stops."
"We can see this spirit of resistance for injustice dehumanizing, with Dr.Aziz too .He is a well educated doctor ,yet this doesn\u2019t prevent the colonialists from dehumanizing him and the other Indians too. He refuses this low attitude toward them, his attitudes are generalized to all British even though he has intimate relations with some effective characters from British society. Dr.Aziz eventually decided to cut of any relation with his British friends , he cant tolerate the feeling of being ruled by strangers who"
"Students can hardly have time to spend with their families because they have to attend to tutorials before and after school hours. Perhaps it is the differences between cultures, one emphasizes on the academic performance of the students, the other one focus on the relationship with the society. Both China and India think that education is number priority of the students to have than anything else. And although it is also the number one priority set for student in USA, however, the way US education has light contents in comparison with China and India."
"Before I walked into the classroom for the first time, my head was filled with questions. The night before I worried about what to wear, when to wake up, when to leave, and what my first day would entail. I was so excited to start my journey as a social studies teacher but had no idea how the day would go. As I walked into the classroom, I saw rows of desks perfectly lined up, facing a white board and a smart board. I scanned the walls and saw posters relating to government and psychology and even a wall displaying Virginia Tech images. I sat down and waited for my cooperating teacher to walk in ten minutes before first period was to start. I read over the bell schedule, checking to see how many classes I would have. When my cooperating teacher walked into the classroom, she greeted me warmly and made me feel more comfortable and confident to begin the day. The students began to fill the room and immediately a young man came up and asked \u201cwho are you?\u201d"
"The EYFS framework is designed to be fully inclusive of all children\u2019s needs, recognising the need to respond to differences of ethnicity, culture, religion or belief, home language, family background, SEN, disability, gender or ability. There is significant flexibility to provide the seven areas of Learning and Development in a way that reflects the needs and circumstances of each child. In the majority of cases it should be possible to deliver the EYFS in a way that is compatible with providers\u2019 and parents\u2019 philosophies and beliefs. The impact legislation and policy has on the promotion of equality, diversity and inclusion within my setting is ensuring policy and procedures are written and adhered to and carried out within the setting, that staff and parents or carers have an awareness of legislation and policy surrounding equality, diversity and inclusion in practice"
"School, a place I thought I would be able to use as an escape from my family. Nothing could have been further from the truth\u2026 I, as I would learn from the other kids, came from the wrong side of the track. This was all the information they needed to bully me about every little thing possible. My clothes, my hair, my weight, and the fact I was poor and so on. Teachers even treated those of us who were socially out cast differently. 2nd grade I was mocked in front of the entire class because I was not able to read. I was put in a class for \u201cspecial\u201d kids which just made life through school very difficult. By the time Jr. High came around I was the weird loner kids that people would mock in the hallways. The bullying so bad I was taken out of school and taught at home. Of course this made it difficult to obtain any real friends."
"Teacher said, \u201cfamilies input is essential in this. In our center we have a form with questions about children. Some won\u2019t be comfortable in writing, so I\u2019ll talk with parents to know their family, culture, and interests. This will help me develop plans for them. Also, in our school they will conduct a developmental screening prior to admission.\u201d"
"It could also cause the soldier not to have a chance to exceed or grow as a soldier or a leader such as go to schools, warrior leader\u2019s course, or even the promotion board. If the disrespect is by jumping the chain of command or the NCO support channel then it would get others in conflict."
"Milestones are extremely controversial and it actually led to his arrest and was accused of conspiring to assassinate President Nasser. This was most likely due to the fact that the ideas he was promoting were in direct opposition to the government it was because of this book that he was sentenced to death and it is also because of this book that reveals both the positive and negative impact that he had on Islam. It is argued that he wanted to implement Sharia law and it would bring about peace prosperity progress and justice. However this book has also become a classic manifesto of the terrorist wing of Islamic fundamentalism. For example the 9/11 attacks some believe that his ideas may have been used by the terrorists responsible and secondly that his promotion of the destruction of Jahiliyah Muslim governments may have roused terrorist jihad and therefore the attacking of Western countries"

The act was hurried to be signed into law on the very same day, however soon rescinded by state law makers, who desire to stress weapon laws for the psychological ill and lawbreakers."
"According to Mkhize et al. (2011), females are making a contribution to the application of exceptional abilities to corporations that influence companies\u2019 revenues and net profit. After the commencement of the gender equality movement, there is progression in the studies in this area this study aims to add to the continuing studies through researching companies that are socially investing to see if gender has an association with company performances indicators like Tobin\u2019s Q and Return on asset."
"But Toys R Us managed to survive and pass with flying colors, a feat owed largely to the solid marketing of the company, making Toys R Us and its efforts in its Japan expansion one of the textbook cases in cross cultural marketing. As Melville (1999) puts it in his book, \u201cToys R Us came to be as a test case, and it did successfully enter and challenged established Japanese toy wholesaler-retailers in price, variety and patronage. Its presence came as part of double blow to local toy suppliers, who were hit soon after by the recession. In 1991, the year Toys R Us entered Japan, seven Japanese toy retailers went bankrupt; in just the first ten months of 1996 there were 15 toy retailer bankruptcies (Melville, 1999, 198).\u201d"
"In my setting, our manager is aiming to become Curiosity approach accredited nursery. This approach is taking ideas from Steiner, Reggio Emilia, Montessori and Te Whariki. This approach concentrates on using natural materials and background, so the children won\u2019t become overstimulated. Using natural materials encourages imagination and curiosity. The approach aims the setting to represent home environment rather than school environment and that is why the children feel safe and confident as at home."
"\u201d Her husband has instructed her a little before the party in how to act and what to say in order to mix with your own people of a different culture and to fit in. She does not want people to know that she is scared of the vibrant and unregimented surroundings and also how ashamed she is of her own kind. Even the kind words of the hostess do not seem of any comfort to her. The beauty of the story is in the symbols used. At first it was the doorstep, the meeting point of the two cultures. Now as the bride sits at \u201cthe edge of the big chair,\u201d symbolising that she is new into the society and yet unwelcome."
"For that reason the state has no right to interpret religious symbols whatsoever or to choose the meaning it thinks is the accurate one, since this will undoubtedly cause resistance and resentment among the community that does not want to be patronised as far as the understanding of their religion is concerned. Given the number of Muslims living in France and the fact that for the considerable part of its ethnic minority, religion is highly significant and deeply anchored in their everyday life, the disregard of the French integration model raised another wave of resentment and aggravated the social situation in France."
"The problem with hate is that it is initially directed towards an enemy. However, when it is continually fueled it is redirected towards loved ones. This is profoundly highlighted by Derek who starts insulting his family and treats them like crap. He is also shown this form of hatred by the people he loves and considers family, when they gang up and rape him in prison."
"Like many southern plantation owners, he saw the color of his slaves also affect the color of their souls; however, conversation between D\u00e9sir\u00e9e and Madame Valmond\u00e9 indicates that he made time for La Blanche, a slave that we can infer through her name that she possibly mixed and is light skinned enough for Armand. The conversation points out that there is a sexual relationship between Armand and La Blanche when D\u00e9sir\u00e9e says the cries of the baby were loud enough that \u201cArmand heard him the other day as far away as La Blanche\u2019s cabin\u2019 (Chopin 432). D\u00e9sir\u00e9e seems to be fine with the fact that there is a sexual relationship between Armand and La Blanche. The birth of the baby caused Armand to be in a happy mood, not allowing anything negative to penetrate his happiness. D\u00e9sir\u00e9e found that \u201cMarriage, and later the birth of his son had softened Armand Aubigny\u2019s imperious and exacting nature greatly\u201d (Chopin 432). For instance, D\u00e9sir\u00e9e tells Madame Valmond\u00e9 \u201c\u2026he hasn\u2019t punished one of them\u2014not one of them\u2014since baby is born. Even N\u00e9grillon, who pretended to have burnt his leg that he might rest from work\u2014he only laughed, and said N\u00e9grillon was a great scamp. Oh, mamma, I\u2019m so happy; it frightens me\u201d (Chopin 432). The birth of the baby boy is softening Armand\u2019s personality and his cruelty towards his slaves. This change in personality that fears D\u00e9sir\u00e9e could only make readers assume that she believes that Armand could snap and this happiness that everyone is experiencing could be dismissed anytime soon."
"However, being protective is entirely different from being too cautious to the point of depriving the children of simple things like chocolate chip cookies because the parent is afraid that the cookie contains too much fat and may be unhealthy for their kid. As the author stated, \u201cyou can\u2019t go around afraid of everything. It\u2019s too exhausting! No matter how careful you are, bad stuff happens. And it\u2019s seldom the end of the world\u201d (Spencer, 2007). Not only is being afraid of everything tiring but it also does not set a good example to the young people."
"According to page 2 of \u201cInformation For Parents: Tetanus and the Vaccine (Shot) to Prevent It\u201d, \u201cTetanus is very dangerous. It can cause breathing problems, muscle spasms, and paralysis (unable to move parts of the body). Muscle spasms can be strong enough to break a child\u2019s spine or other bones. It can take months to recover fully from tetanus."
"In 2005, 75 reported cases of children 14 and below died from accidental firearm-related injuries; most children of this group have ages ranging from 10-14 years old. The majority of unintentional gun-related deaths among children take place in or around the household; 5 out of 10 cases occur at the victim\u2019s home while 4 out of ten cases happens at a friend or relative\u2019s house . Keeping firearms at home for protection often leads to accidental deaths."
"Jesus also treated a Samaritan woman as his equal, and also had a black African man help him to carry his cross. People, who believe strongly in Christianity, see this as a good example to follow. As there are many good Christians in the world, it is likely that they all agree with racial harmony, and try to create it amongst other religions."
"According to Ting-Toomey, the distinction between individualistic and collectivists cultures is seen on how the former gives more importance to the face of the individual while the latter gives more attention to the welfare of the group (Gudykunst, 2005). The major tenets of the Face Negotiation Theory are greatly applicable with my life, especially since I interact with people that have different cultural background."
"Drawing on Canetti\u2019s ideas, these two crowds are opposed the one in a music concert reflect a joyful excitement with people cheering and dancing whereas the other one was a crown of angry demonstrators fighting with the police, throwing objects to the security and displaying massages of unhappiness about the increase of university student fees (Utube videos; lead British Conversation)."
"Since immigrants were far to poor to move farther away from cities so they huddled together in the already stinking slums, where they were allegedly hard to \u201cAmericanize.\u201d This caused many Americans to think that America would no longer live up to its wonderful reputation as the land of opportunity, because immigrants were going to, slowly but surely, change the face of America."
"Child abuse has mental effects that may hinder the advancement of the individual\u2019s character and identity. This is specifically real the abuser is the parent. For circumstances, the abused child is expected to have low self-confidence that originates from the reality that his own parents do not enjoy him. Abusing him is a clear indication to him that they do not love him."
"There are four parenting styles, which include authoritative, authoritarian, permissive and disengaged. Parenting styles are evaluated through the means of demandingness and responsiveness. The demandingness aspect is comprised of how parents produce expectations and guidelines for their children. The responsiveness involves the compassion and warmth parents express towards their children\u2019s needs and their children in general. Authoritative parents are both high in demandingness and high in responsiveness; meaning that these parents have high prospects for their children but also engage in discussion with their children to explain why things may be the way they are. Authoritarian parenting style is high in demandingness but low in responsiveness; this means that the parents have great expectations for their children, and do not display much warmth toward them. Permissive parenting style is low in demandingness and high in responsiveness; this means that the parent has limited expectations of their children and express great warmth toward their children. The disengaged parenting style displays low in both demandingness and responsiveness. Unfortunately, the parents that use this approach are commonly uninvolved with their children\u2019s lives."

"A: Here a semantic field of agony is evident through the words \u2018pain\u2026 tightened\u2026pain\u2019, which suggests that Crooks ranch life underprivileged and too challenging for someone of his figure. The use of pre-modifier \u2018pain-tightened\u2019, illustrates the depth of ache within crook, which makes him unable to speak up for himself, due to having no greater dominance in contrast to other ranch workers including Curley\u2019s wife."
"Opponents of capital punishment point to an imperfection of the judicial system and its frequent mistakes, an inconsistency of the indicated problem in the context of international law, financial costs, as well as doubtfulness of a preventive effect. In light of increased terrorist attacks, there was another argument like suicide bomber did not scare death. Perhaps, only organizers of the attacks themselves are not in a hurry to part with life. And for them, an execution is a quite likely outcome. However, outraged public opinion requires a fair impact on the offenders and does not want to tolerate the facts of insufficiently severe sentences or an abandonment of life by dangerous, incorrigible criminals. And no matter how incompetent, uncivilized it may be, it cannot be ignored. Otherwise, instead of verdicts, according to the law and the court, a \u201cpunitive presumption\u201d of the population begins."
"As for the off duty officer, who beat the suspect, he received 45 days in jail. In this case, brutality and misconduct was present when the arrest process was taking place. I agree with what BCP Commissioner stated. Any unethical behavior of a police officer shall not be tolerated. Although the punishment was light on Gialamas, it took effect on his career and his family. The law and the court saw him as a law-breaker and a person that cannot be trusted within the department. Everyone else knew him as a kind, honest man, but when faced with the law it turned the tables on him. I believe that in this case, because the officer had a clean record and showed signs of pity and embarrassment; the court was right on dropping the jail time. Eventually Gialamas completed his community service hours and probations time and now is fighting to keep a job in law enforcement."
"\u201cAmerica fever\u201d caught on in Europe as the United States was portrayed as a land of great opportunities. Persecutions of minorities in Europe sent many fleeing immigrants to the United States. Many immigrants never intended to stay in America forever; a large number returned home with money. Those immigrants who stayed in the United States struggled to preserve their traditional culture."
"As the title of the chapter reads, this generation can be called \u201cthe revolutionary generation\u201d, precisely because it formed and sustained a new idea with regard to slavery. The first wave of the revolution seemed to grasp the problem of slavery in its entirety. The leaders as well as the common people began to gain insight into the atrocities perpetuated by slavery. The just observation was made that the existence of slavery in America was a real opprobrium for the country and its status among the other countries of the world."
"His two children Lois and Wilma are thrilled but their mother is less than satisfied as feel he is wasting his money as they already have a car. Wilbert decides to take a trip down to Mississippi, which is in the south of America where black people have fewer rights and where some people are notoriously racist. After her boycott of riding in the car Wilbert\u2019s wife, Dee decides that the whole family will go including herself. Halfway to Mississippi, Wilbert is arrested and fined unreasonably for speeding. At this point I think that he begins to understand why his wife had protested so much to the car, it had caused his youngest daughter Lois to be so scared that she had to hold a knife for her own protection. It was at this point that Wilbert decides to go home and get his cousins car. When the family got back from Mississippi the car was sold bringing their whole family closer together."
"\u2019 (Daniels: 1989) Parallel to these representations of African-American figures in the media, notions cited from Daniels (1989:3) are those of Halls who profoundly highlights, \u2018[t]he depiction of blacks in popular media is restricted to a repertoire of basic images \u2013 the slave, the native, the entertainer \u2013 as only certain traits and characteristics are selected for emphasis. \u2019 Black people were subjected to the notion that as a cohort they were portrayed to be the same as one another; having no original identity as an African-American as there were no other representations of the black cultural community."
"What the article is saying is that these forces can shape how we see and respond to society. For example, if you are a weak little boy growing up around gangs, you might see the power of gangs engaging and choose to indulge in illegal activities purely for your thirst for power. Or if you\u2019re head over heels in love with someone, your love may shape your actions and choices. Maybe even your willingness to see someone can cause you to do something you wouldn\u2019t normally do. All in all, these forces can either lead you to do something good, bad, or both."
"Furthermore, this act also barred all immigrants that were considered by the federal government as ineligible for citizenship based on the race, the region where a certain foreigner came from. Like for the case of those people from Eastern and Southern Europe as well as those people from the East Asia and Asian Indians was being prohibited by the federal government from naturalizing themselves into being an American citizen."
"In the ranch where Lennie and George worked on was in Soledad, California which was where people went to chase their dreams it was known as the place of dreams. The Great Depression occurred between 1930-1936 meaning that most people were unemployed and money had been lost while banks had gone bust. This would have meant people who were discriminated e.g. disabled people or black people this could suggest that it was harder for them to live. LITERARY DEVICES"
"At seventeen, Hally is an intelligent and sensitive individual, which makes the fact that he reverts to a racist stance all the more disturbing in its implication of the depths to which prejudice runs in South Africa. Under stress, his racist training sadly wins out over his humanitarian instincts. The white superiority on which apartheid rested is exposed as a sham, and Fugard suggests that through better education and communication it could be combated. The spitting on Sam by Hally is pivotal in the play and hints to the forthcoming of all that is bad in the world."
"The arrangements and events regarding the marriage are know to be Marriage Ceremonies. The events are quite different in different regions and religions. Nowadays among Pakistani Muslims, the main events are Dholak, Mehndi, Baraat and Waleema. And Nikaah, which is the actual bonding of individuals, has become a separate portion to celebrate. As Muslims of Pakistan lived along Hindus before independence, so have an influence of Hindus upon themselves. The influence includes several rituals like those of Mehndi (which is named as Haldi in India) and Dholak (which is named as Sangeet in India)."
"The movie interprets themes such as racism and power through viscious language, camera angles and brutal detail. The film is set in a small Mississippi County called Jessup. This is a place where not only the characters are tough but so are the people. Characters such as Deputy Pell and Sheriff Stuckey are used to show what it is like living there and how tough and stubborn people can be. Parker presents a town full of racial segregation and this is shown when Anderson and Ward go to the local diner for lunch."
"It is up to the practitioner\u2019s knowledge, believes and experience on which approach would use when planning the environment for learning, however, as wide the knowledge of the practitioner of the different approaches is, as better. For me personally, I do like the Montessori approach and when I plan the environment, I include lots of natural objects, lots objects from the everyday world with which the children can play with their own ideas and imagination."
"It is evident that the arguments in favor of implementing the death penalty far much outweigh those against its implementation. I would then mention the fact that the death penalty will assist in lowering cases of malicious murders within the society, as well as serve as the best sentence when compared the affliction of the victim\u2019s family. Hence, I conclude this essay by supporting the fact that implementation of the death penalty is justified because it assists in the reduction of malicious murders; at the same time, remains the best punishment for convicted murderers."
"Immigration policy in the United States reflects many goals. First, it serves to reunite many families by admitting family members from foreign countries. Second, due to labor shortage, United States can admit ones with a specific skill to fill up positions in occupations. Third, it provides a shelter for people that face the risk of political or religious persecution from their own country."
"Pa also known as Alphonso, impregnates Celie twice, and both times he takes the baby away after birth basically getting rid of the evidence that he has been abusing her. Pa starts eyeing Nettie and refuses to let her marry; instead the abuse continues for Celie when Pa marries Celie off to Mr. ____ and is forced into a difficult and joyless marriage. After Celie\u2019s mama dies, Pa marries one of many young wives that he will mistreat and make have kids. For the majority of the novel, He see not only Celie but all women as stupid, in need of abuse, constant direction from men, and only useful as sexual objects and laborers. By beating Celie repeatedly,"
"When I read \u201cLegal Alien,\u201d I feel related to it because all of the problems that the author explained about I felt like I have gone through that in my life at one point or another. Writes by a Mexican-American woman named Pat Mora who is fluent in English and Spanish, \u201cLegal Alien\u201d is a free verse poem that explains about how the author is treated by other cultures because of her dual culture heritage. The author and the critics demonstrate how much it is difficult to deal with culture conflict and self-identity."
"Juan winds up as a mechanic and engaged to his fianc\u00e9e Brenda. They live in an old \u201cMill Town\u201d. Together they live with four of his five children.

He continues to resent having to be \u201cdirty\u201d all the time due to the nature of the work. He admits to Macleod that he yearns for a cleaner job where he gets to look better and wear a suit. He says that people judge you buy the way you look. He is happy that he has a house and a mortgage that he can afford and his children will benefit from but he does not have a car. James"
"Both women from the Union and The Confederate Army played a huge role in the Civil War. From things as important as tending to wounded soldiers on the front lines to simple things such as providing a sense of hope for soldiers serving in the war, women were a key part of the war effort. Women who were limited in terms of importance gained a significant amount more authority and leadership as a result of the war. Mothers and Wives of deployed soldiers became the heads of the household, carrying out roles, such as tending crops and animals, traditionally done by a man."
"On the other hand, the lady is continuously described in positive terms, suggesting that she is of a good breeding and upper class. Even when the reader finds out that she is a shallow and racist person who exhibits extreme insensitivity by asking crude questions, the man seems to think that she is \u2018considerate; and her clinical response to his question shows only \u2018light impersonality. \u2019 The repeated and exaggerated assertions of the woman\u2019s good manners and sophistication drip with irony as her speech contradict this strongly."
"Abortion is the most controversial issue having no grounds of agreement among two polar aspects. The argument is life and death. Abortion is morally wrong because it\u2019s murder we are not the ones that can decide whether the person that a woman gives birth to should live or die. Abortion is a life or death matter, and there are supporters on both sides. Yet those supporters have one goal in common: decreasing the number of abortions and making abortion safer."
"The other path, the narrow one which is available for John, is the religious one his parents and his community offer him. Here the third chapter \u201cThe Treshing Floor\u201d or rather the conversion scene in this chapter can be taken as a good example. Even though John mentioned before that \u201che did not long for the narrow way, where all his people walked\u201d , in chapter three he engages in an ecstatic conversion. Therefore this experience is questionable and rather seems to be a flight from the quest for identity into the ostensible safety the black church offers . During his spiritual experience he encounters various obstacles, his father being the most difficult one. While John is lying in front of the altar he sees his father looking down on him without pity or love, but instead he keeps hearing him say: \u201cI\u2019m going to beat sin out of him. I\u2019m going to beat it out!\u201d ."
"The first problem is that the justice system is never 100% correct. \u201cJudges and juries can convict the innocent like Donald Marshall, who was jailed for more than a decade for a murder he did not commit. Most crimes end up with people getting jail time or an alternative punishment. Sometimes people are actually innocent. Due to people only going to jail the sentencing can be reversed. A person who is sentenced to death penalty is not . the jury also plays a big role in sentencing someone no matter what people can be sentenced to a crime they didn\u2019t commit due to a jury member possibly having something against another person and even though the jury gets \u201ctested\u201d before the hearing or case they could still potentially hold hatred toward someone or something. This also brings the conclusion that The death penalty is unjust and morally wrong. When a person kills someone else you can\u2019t just punish them by death. the correct punishment is not to murder him or her, you can potentially fix them by a rehabilitation center or possibly a ward of some sort. Why do we murder the murderers if all were going to do is murder again it would be an endless stream of murdering. In a case study scientist and researchers have found that 36 states ban the death penalty or do not have it as a punishment in their from of trial by jury. This proves that most people and states think that the death penalty should not be legal and proves more and more how morally wrong the death penalty is. Not only is killing someone hard to do but to even think of killing another person sickens most. To even fathom the thought of killing them would honestly take a cold hearted person or someone who personalizes in death so typically there would not be anyone who\u2019s willing to take another person\u2019s life that should not be charged with a crime."
"I think another issues with linguistic diversity is that the teacher needs to expect has much out of the non-English speaking students as the English speaking students. If a teacher starts off expecting less than she will get just that. A teacher needs to monitor herself and meet with other teachers and discuss observations, progress and the way that students are tested and evaluated so that the teachers are not setting them up to fail."
"The ghost also introduces the idea of murder in the play, stating alliteratively, \u201cMurder most foul. \u201d Orders are also given to Hamlet by the ghost such as \u201cRevenge his foul and most unnatural murder\u201d and the haunting \u201cRemember me. \u201d All of these factors come together to make Hamlet pity his father and be even more prepared to seek his father\u2019s revenge."
"This is encapsulated by the line from which the book\u2019s title is taken from: \u201cThe best laid schemes of mice and men/Go often awry. \u201d George also comes to this realisation toward the end of the book: \u201cI think I knowed from the very first\u2026 we\u2019d never do her. \u201d This situation of menial, back-breaking labour is also shown to be self-perpetuating as Steinbeck shows, in plain Realist fashion, how the labourers would go out to the town to fritter away their hard earned money in the brothels and bars then have to earn it all again."
"What matters is that you learn from what you experience. \u201d And by learning, he means the hardwired kind. \u201cBrain mapping indicates that media violence is processed along primitive survival pathways and stored in long-term memory,\u201d he says. In other words, we embed media violence deeply in our brains. In work with functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, Rich\u2019s team has discovered that \u201cthe brain regions activated when viewing violence onscreen are the same ones that light up when those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder relive their traumas. \u201d"
"A big difference between the two stories is humour. For example there is no humour at all in \u2018The Half Brothers\u2019 whereas a lot of humour is used in \u2018My Oedipus Complex\u2019. \u2018The Half Brothers\u2019 is very different because the absence of humour defines the story as a real tragedy. Humour in \u2018My Oedipus Complex\u2019 lightens the story considerably and it becomes merely unfortunate. The source of humour in \u2018My Oedipus Complex\u2019 is from Larry saying or thinking things that are ironic because he thinks he\u2019s so mature but is really an inexperienced child."
"Reduction refers to methods that minimize the number of animals used per experiment or study. It also includes methods which allow the information gathered per animal in an experiment to be shared in order to reduce the use of additional animals. Examples of this include the use of some imaging modalities which allow longitudinal measurements in the same animal to be taken or micro sampling of blood, where small volumes enable repeat sampling in the same animal. Refinement refers to methods that minimize the pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm that may be experienced by research animals. Refinement applies to all aspects of animal use, from their housing and husbandry to the scientific procedures performed on them. Examples of refinement include ensuring the animals are provided with housing that allows the expression of species-specific behaviors, using appropriate anesthesia to minimize pain, and to minimize any distress. Evidence suggests that pain and suffering can alter an animal\u2019s behavior, physiology, and immunology. Such changes can lead to variation in experimental results that impairs both the reliability and repeatability of studies. The 3Rs, over time, have become established as crucial considerations and influenced new legislation aimed at controlling the use of animals in these experiments. Animals used in product testing endure pain, stress, and have no chance for a quality of life. While testing is being done on animals, they cannot express in words how they are feeling about what is being done to them. Animals have feelings, show love, and definitely feel pain. Anyone with an animal can attest to that. Why do we have a right to mistreat another living creature? A conservative estimate is that tens of millions of animals are being killed or maimed each year in research on the safety and effectiveness of new drugs, agricultural chemicals and consumer products. Besides living in very small cages, they are often restrained while given hurtful things both topically and internally injected. A four-month secret investigation of a Canadian lab in 2016 revealed animals left untreated, abused physically by lab techs, and nothing was reported about this stress and treatment. (Care 2) The animals either die during the testing or soon after from the abuse or they are euthanized. They are never released. They never get to feel love and enjoyment. They never get to experience life. The animals are under extreme stress. Stress negatively influences the reliability of animal research data. Stress influences heart rate, pulse, blood pressure, muscular activity, and hormone levels and can modify the normal values of these variables significantly. Studies have shown that animals experience sympathy pains and react to seeing and hearing other animals in distress. (Feder) So, ultimately the mistreatment and lack of care sabotages their tests. Not only is the use of animals cruel, it is also inaccurate. Does a human body resemble the body of a rat? The answer is NO, we are not made up exactly like a rat! Animals used in testing are not the same as human beings and the results are not always accurate because of that. Many tests have been done on the reliability of the results from animals. Often the animal will show one result and another animal will show a different result and still the human being shows another result. Do you trust that the product was okay on a mouse so it must be okay on your child? Industry executives say that as much as 25 percent of the drugs tested on animals failed to show side effects that later proved serious enough to prevent the drugs from being marketed. (Feder) Basically, if a coin was flipped to guess how a human will respond to a certain drug, the prediction would actually be as accurate as if you tested the drug on a nonhuman animal. One example is with the late Dr. Bj\u00a7rn Ekwall (Cytotoxicology Laboratory in Sweden) who developed a replacement for the LD50 test that measured toxicity at a precision rate of up to 85% accuracy compared to the original LD50 rate on animals of 61-65%. This test, far more accurate than the animal models, uses donated human tissue rather than animals. Also, the test can target toxic effects on specific human organs, whether the toxic substance permeates the blood barrier, and other highly sophisticated and precise information that the agonizing death of an animal of a different species would not reveal. (Neavs) Another example is cancer research. Despite millions of animals used and billions of taxpayer dollars spent on cancer research, roughly 95% of cancer drugs that enter human clinical testing fail while our incidences of cancer have continued to rise. (Neavs) For decades, cancer has been cured for in mice but does not work in humans. Even chimpanzees, our closest genetic relatives, do not accurately predict results in humans. Of the more than 80 HIV vaccines that have proven safe and efficacious in chimpanzees (as well as other nonhuman primates), all have failed to protect or prove safe in humans in nearly 200 human clinical trials, with one actually increasing a human\u2019s chance of HIV infection. (Neavs) One last example is when London clinicians injected six volunteers with tiny doses of TGN1412, an experimental therapy for rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis that had previously been given, with no obvious ill effects, to mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys. Within minutes, the human test subjects were writhing on the floor in agony. The compound was designed to dampen the immune response but it had supercharged theirs, unleashing a cascade of chemicals that sent all six to the hospital. Several of the men suffered permanent organ damage, and one man\u2019s head swelled up so horribly that British tabloids refer to the case as the \u201celephant man trial.\u201d (Allen) A few other examples would be that penicillin is toxic to guinea pigs, aspirin is poisonous to cats, and the recalled diet drug phen-fen caused no heart damage in animals, while it did in humans. Species differences in anatomy, organ structure and function, toxin metabolism, chemical and drug absorption, and mechanisms of DNA repair, among other differences between humans and other species, can give us inadequate information when we attempt to apply animal data to human diseases and drug responses. Since animals and humans are not exact, don\u2019t you think it would be wise to use another way to test products that are more reliable? Animals used in testing can and should be replaced by other scientifically proven alternatives. Wouldn\u2019t it make sense to spend money on testing that has reliable true results? There are many alternatives that can be used that do save the company money while providing accurate results that do not torture animals in the process. Nearly 50 different alternative methods and testing strategies have been developed, validated and/or accepted by international regulatory authorities. (Human Society) Snippets of human skin, eyes, and the lining of the throat and other tissues are now routinely grown in test tubes from donated human cells. Human cells have been used to create innovative little devices called organs-on-chips\u2019. These can be used instead of animals to study biological and disease processes, as well as drug metabolism. Devices have already been produced that accurately mimic the lung, heart, kidney and gut. The ultimate goal is to use these chips to create a whole human-on-a-chip'(Cruelty Free) Human tissue can be donated from surgery (e.g. biopsies, cosmetic surgery and transplants). Human tissue can also be used after a person has died (e.g. post-mortems). Post-mortem brain tissue has provided important leads to understanding brain regeneration and the effects of Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinson\u2019s disease. (Cruelty Free) In-vitro tests using human cells have been making headway. InVitro International\u2019s Corrositex (synthetic skin) can provide a chemical corrosivity determination in as little as 3 minutes to four hours, unlike animal testing that often takes two to four weeks. DakDak, an alternative test used to measure the effectiveness of sunscreens, was reported to do in days what it takes animal studies months to do, and estimates that it can test five or six products for less than half the cost to study a single product in animals. The traditional testing of chemicals using animals can take up to five years per substance and cost millions of dollars, while non-animal alternatives can test hundreds of chemicals in a week for a fraction of the cost. (Neavs) There are also stem cell and genetic testing methods. Scientists have even managed to get cells to grow into 3D structures, such as miniature human organs, which can provide a more realistic way to test new tings. Testing is being conducted virtually, using computers and simulation software. People are able to volunteer for testing that is not fatal or have any bad side effects. These volunteers get microdoses (very low quantities) of potential drugs. These tests will not affect the whole body system. By using blood from human volunteers to test for the presence of fever-causing contaminants in intravenous medicines can save hundreds of thousands of rabbits each year from traditional \u201cpyrogen\u201d tests. (Humane Society) Procter & Gamble has spent $225 million developing and deploying alternative testing methods for a wide range of personal-care and pet food products over the last 20 years. (Feder) L\u2019Or\u00a9al, the French cosmetics giant, says it has spent more than $800 million over the same period. That includes deals to buy Episkin and SkinEthic, two companies that make alternative tests.(Feder) Relying on animal research and testing to protect and improve human health is not only unsafe and inhumane to the animals, but also expensive, time-consuming, and unreliable. They cannot do anything but sit in the cage and suffer. How would you like to spend your entire life in a space as big as a small box enduring horrific pain and suffering with no way to say no or say stop. These animals are suffering for unnecessary reasons. It has been proven again and again that things that work in animals fail in humans. WE are not exactly the same and the results are also not going to be the same with so many differences within each species. There are many other available alternatives that will do a better job and save millions of animals from suffering. You can see that by replacing animal tests does not mean putting human patients at risk. It also does not mean halting medical progress. Instead, replacing animal testing will improve the quality as well as the humaneness of our science. Animal testing on innocent animals is not what we should be doing at this point in our evolution. We are a smart resourceful living being that has alternative methods that are cheaper, reliable, and less cruel to other living things."
"Celie and Nettie have never stopped loving each other because their sisterly friendship and bond has kept them strong. Celie made it through her hard life with Mr, because her love for Nettie gave her a stronger sense of courage and self, allowed her eventually to realize that men were not there to control and take over her life, and to end her passive behaviour."
"In Minnesota in a 15 year period, there were only 14 maternal suicides. 11 occurred after delivery. None were illegitimately pregnant. All were psychotic. In contrast, among the first 8 deaths of women aborted under the liberal law in the United Kingdon, 2 were from suicide directly following the abortion. Are there any medical indications for abortion?? Is it valid for a doctor to co-operate in the choice for abortion? The late Dr. Guttmacher, one of the world leaders of the pro-abortion movement, has stated: \u201cAlmost any women can be brought through pregnancy alive unless she suffers from cancer or leukemia, in which case abortion is unlikely to prolong her life much less save it.\u201d As an opponent to abortion, I will readily agree, as will all those who are against abortion, that pregnancy resulting from rape or incest is a tragedy. Rape is a detestable crime, but no sane reasoning can place the slightest blame on the unborn child it might produce. Incest is, if that is possible, even worse, but for centuries, traditional Jewish law has clearly stated, that if a father sins against his daughter (incest) that does not justify a second crime \u2013 the abortion of the product of that sin. The act of rape or incest is the major emotional physical trauma to the young girl or women. Should we compound the psychic scar already inflicted on the mother by her having the guilt of destroying a living being which was at least half her own? Throughout history, pregnant women who for one crime or another were sentenced to death, were given a stay of execution until after the delivery of the child: it being the contention of courts that one could not punish the innocent child for the crime of the mother. Can we punish it for a crime against the mother? If rape occurred the victim should immediately report the incident. If this is done, early reporting of the crime will provide greater opportunity for apprehension and conviction of the rapist, for treatment of venereal disease and prevention of pregnancy. Let is give our children good sex education; and let us get tough on pornography, clean up the newstands, literature and \u201cAdult Movies\u201d and television programmes which encourage crime, abusive drugs and make mockery of morality and good behaviour and therefore, contribute to rape. By some peculiar trick of adult logic, proponents of abortion talk about fetal indications for act. Whatever abortion may do for the mother, it so very obviously cannot be therapeutic for the fetus. Death is hardly a constructive therapy. As Dr. Hellegers of John Hopkins Hospital says, \u201cWhile it is easy to feel that abortion is being performed for the sake of the fetus, honesty requires us to recognize that we perform it for adults\u201d. There is no evidence to indicate that an infant with congenital or birth defect would rather not be born since he cannot be consulted."
"The report states that the reason why girls are dragged into forced marriages are; repayment of debts; to solve a dispute and to pay family expenses. Moreover, It is obvious among Pashtons, that their widow will never marry someone out of their family, as they always marry the brother of their deceased husband. However in a non-Pashton family, the girl is asked to marry her brother-in-law to get support for the children of her sister. Even worse, some sisters are married to pay for the crime of their brothers by marrying the victims."
"As the library industry looks for new ways to stay relevant in an increasingly paperless world, it is important to look at these results. The books are not the deciding factor in the happiness of individuals, but they can increase happiness or provide support when one lacks social support. Therefore, in order to provide the most support to communities, libraries should continue to make a concerted effort to provide a diverse range of programs, whether members of the communities choose to actually read books or not."
"Te reason she done this because she left the audience in suspense, she also wanted to make the audience to think how he tried to become an English man. \u2018Old Father\u2019 tried to everything that white person would do, but where ever he goes he still gets silly remakes. \u2018He \u2018s a example to his people\u2019."
"People who are afraid of complications are afraid to raise children and this leaves them in solitude especially when they became old.\u00a0 The older waiter concluded that he has nothing but a job, and that what makes him apathetic with the old man probably seeing himself like one of his kind someday. However, he believed more in an unchallenged but less complicated life for which many are drawn to follow that path today."
"Of these two stories, Walker\u2019s \u201cThe Welcome Table\u201d is slightly more successful because of its brevity and its parable-like nature. Gordimer\u2019s story, while sharing the same broad target of racism and its iniquities, has a different impact because it is a story of love gone wrong, love denied by social conditions, love controlled by the law."
"The viewers might not agree with Bianca\u2019s decision about her unborn child, but the message to think carefully and make the choice that is right for herself and the baby, seems right. In Coronation Street, the character Toyah found the courage to do the right thing and go to the police after she had been raped, even though many women in society do find this difficult to do. It is this \u201cideological significance\u201d and verisimilitude that soaps inherit which fulfil the viewers\u2019 desires and enhance soaps popularity."
"After this the father had decided he couldn\u2019t cope, as I walked through the children I held my head low to show he was regretting his decision and not wanting to look his children who he is abandoning, in the face. The father is a coward and as I said that I couldn\u2019t cope I spoke very quietly and slowly. We used many conventions in this performance; flash back, tableau (freeze frame) and slow motion. A flash back is where you move from one scene to another scene in the past. We used the flash back when we showed how the mother died and why she had dropped out of the picture."
"After learning about the famous Greek philosophers, I would like to stand back and give myself some introspective about the matter. Care Ethics demands that we pay attention to the special relationships we have in our lives. It says that morality goes wrong when we emphasize impartiality because it\u2019s our most caring relationships that make our lives worthwhile. Even though we might have a general love for humanity itself, we can\u2019t beat the unconditional love that we only have with the people we know best."
"Additionally, once workers become glad with their work, they work with high level of productivity and lead to most output that mechanically creates the business name amongst the competitors and market. the businesses creating a balance between employees\u2019 work life and social life attract a broader pool of experienced and qualified individuals."
"Being empathetic is associated with the capability to comprehend children\u2019s emotions, such as emotional recognition, emotion contagion, and emotional intelligence along with the ability to understand the internal state of them through observation and actions. Women have got this natural empathetic mindset where they can understand the personal and emotional trait of children\u2019s brain and living."
"Additionally, the researchers took into consideration many factors that may have affected the economic status of these women, including their household size, whether the women was living with adult family members, with a male partner or neither, household income of all adults living with the respondents etc. They assessed employment in terms of full time, part time and not employed and operationalised poverty as at or below 100% of that specific year\u2019s US Census Bureau Federal Poverty Line (FPL). By controlling these variables, they were able to objectively study the link between abortion and poverty. Operationalising poverty ensured that the researchers properly assessed whether the participants could be deemed poor or not. This increases the reliability of the study."
"Source A is taken from a speech of Roosevelt\u2019s during his election campaign in 1932. It begins with an almost religious pledge for a New Deal. Roosevelt says that his campaign, \u2018is more than a political campaign: it is a call to arms. \u2018 Roosevelt is trying to say that his campaign is not just political, but that he is trying to gather everyone up so that he can have their help, \u2018not to win votes alone, but to win in this crusade to restore America."
"Currently, I am working as a Head of the Marketing Department in Goyo LLC, Tavan Bogd Group. For the last two seasons, I\u2019ve done many job interviews with younger people who have graduated from universities in developed countries, such as UK, Australia, China, Singapore, and Taiwan. During those interviews, as a Head of the Marketing Department, I\u2019ve employed the best of the best but also realized my current education background and competency might be challenged in the future as the younger generation is constantly educating themselves in more higher education institutions all over the world."
"After reading McIntosh\u2019s list, my reaction was confusion. Some of the listed seems not a privilege but based on own belief and racial issues. Like the number six list where she stated, \u201cwhen I am told about our national heritage or about \u201ccivilization,\u201d I am shown that people of my color made it what it is\u201d. I have to disagree about that because American\u2019s history is not about a single particular race. There are also many famous African American historians like Martin Luther King Jr, President Barrack Obama, and more."

"The title itself \u201cLast of the Mohicans\u201d symbolizes the death of the native Indian Culture in the encroaching approach of European civilization. The death of Uncas particularly laments the end of the Mohicans civilization. The title itself determines the ultimate tragedy of the novel\u2019s plot. The novel was fruitful contribution to still remember that once in American frontier; there came an ancient civilization that must be saluted with their expertise in the wilderness and pioneer life."
"Although global warming is a real issue, some efforts from the general public are doing us more harm than good. Protests consisting of over fifty people strolling down the streets are not only halting public transport, but are also disturbing residents, causing trouble in the work forces they have abandoned to support the protests, and cause further trouble for our government as well as sceptics who will now degrade and think even lesser of supporters of this issue. Extremists are the sole reason non-believers have such a sour taste in their mouth when global warming is even mentioned. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, a democrat who preaches the cheap lifestyle and the stop of global warming, said that \u2018The world will end in 12 years if global warming isn\u2019t stopped\u2019, which is totally fabricated. Ludacris even. She had no proof, no"
"Even though, they didn\u2019t have serious sentences this was the first time someone was convicted of a crime against a civil rights worker. I think this shows that minorities were not treated fairly and still were not free. They have had almost the same rights white people did, but black people still did and still do have to face backlash because of their background and skin color. This example shows how black people were treated even after the \u201cI Have a Dream Speech\u201d. Could it because white people were afraid their power would be taken away or was it because they didn\u2019t think black people should have the same rights as them? If there was never slavery in the world, I wonder how things would be. I feel like most people would get a long better and that black and whites might get a long better. This example displays how there is still people out there who can not stand minorities or other races."
"Thanks to Slim we shouldn\u2019t get canned coz he made it pretty clear to Curley that if he told anyone how this happened he would say how easily Lennie crushed his hand. Curley agreed not to tell anyone, so hopefully all that is all settled. I thought that would of ended our chance of the dream."
"My father is a person who puts forward education. Despite his condition at that time, my father continued to struggle to continue his education to a higher level, a secondary engineering school. Yes, that\u2019s the school my father chose for the continuation of his school. Despite that, my father must be willing to join the rich people who want to guarantee his school. Which every morning he had to prepare food and clean the house of someone who helped with his school fees."

"It is barely seen a film have such multi civilization in Malay old movie. The national individuality is to make a sense of state, it merely can be done when the have the thought that the land does n\u2019t owned by anyone, but they were all born equal in this topographic point. This film successfully present the message. and helped build the sense of state, althought it is merely one short scene, but it is still a large measure for the Malaysia \u2018s industry at the decennary."
"Ask: Why do people move? What forces do you think drive human migration? Then explain to students that people move for many reasons and that those reasons are called push factors and pull factors. Tell students that push factors include leaving a place because of a problem, such as a food shortage, war, or flood. Tell students that pull factors include moving to a place because of something good, such as a nicer climate, more job opportunities, or a better food supply. Ask: What effect does a region\u2019s economy; climate, politics, and culture have on migration to and from the area? Have students brainstorm additional reasons for migrating, such as displacement by a natural disaster, lack of natural resources, the state of an economy, and more. The relatively permanent movement of people across territorial boundaries is referred to as in migration and out-migration, or immigration and emigration when the boundaries crossed are international."
"Steinbeck wrote Crooks differently. He was a proud man standing among a sea of meek, timid African Americans personalities commonly featured in writing. Crooks was capable of conversing with as eloquent of a tongue as his fellow workers and was educated, but he knew his place in society. He longed to be bunked with the other ranchers and he knew he had a right to equal accommodations because Section 51 states of hi \u201cmauled\u201d California Civil Code of 1905 (70), \u201cAll citizens within the jurisdiction of this state are entitled to the full and equal accommodations\u201d. Yet he knew that because of the \u201cSeparate but Equal\u201d laws that he would never be accommodated in the same quarters as the other ranchers (A Brief History). The ranch hands hurled racial slurs at his misshapen spine and only weathered his presence on Sunday afternoons when his horseshoe playing skills (46). Regardless of his ill treatment, he endured because he had nowhere else to go."
"The judge that oversaw the case, Judge Guy Reece, was only doing his job and following the law, when he granted Lifeline permission to harvest Elijah\u2019s organs. Elijah\u2019s mother was enraged and felt that Lifeline had gone behind their backs to get Elijah\u2019s organs. This case has shown just how difficult end-of-life decisions can be, particularly when weighed against the dire need for organs for transplantation. Less than 1% of deaths are classified as brain deaths, but these cases make up the majority of donations, as doctors prefer organs that are still connected to a functioning heart and body. Ohio currently has 5.3 million registered organ donors, but the need still far outstrips supply. 18 people die every day in the US waiting for a transplant.( McCleskey 2013) Lifeline says that they encourage everyone that decides to become an organ donor, to have conversation with their family before doing so. This may deter something like this from happening again."
"James Baldwin the African-American novelist and social critic, was born in Harlem, (1924-1987). Baldwin grew up a poor, unhappy, man after his mother\u2019s marriage in 1927. His stepfather, a domineering fundamentalist minister from New Orleans, seemed to hate his stepson. He read prodigiously, and became a junior minister whose oratory attracted a growing congregation, in his teens. James Baldwin lost his faith subsequently, and left Harlem to work in Jersey City. His experience of racism and segregation in Harlem drove him to Greenwich Village where he found a much better acial climate and more opportunities for him to write."
"My friend Peter Johnson is a 35 years old African American male living alone in the province of St Peters. He has always been an independent iron-will man going after what he wants in life, as a result of his strong will he has managed to accomplish so many things. Today he is the owner of a very successful Air conditioning company. His ambition and determination has afforded him the opportunity of traveling extensively, owning a luxurious home, and having three vehicles, he enjoys the pleasures of life."
"One of the predicaments of Indian women is the identity crisis that occurs at the time of marriage. Similar to other heroines of Shashi Despande novels like Jaya in The Long Silence, Mira too undergoes a change in her name from Mira to Nirmala which she cannot accept. She feels that she is insecure by the new identity which results in emotional distress which further escalates when her husband shows interest only in her body by forsaking her real emotion through care and consideration. The novelist opines that \u201cshe refuses to give up her name and identity and proclaims \u201cI am Mira\u201d (1)."
"Yes it is sometimes fun to joke around talking about stereotypes with friends. But when you are referring to a single person or trying to communicate with a group of people it is not a good idea to fall back on the stereotypes that you first thing of. No one likes to be stereotyped. It is important to know at least some of the cultures and co-cultures here at Bellevue College so that you do not stereotype them by accident. It is never a good idea to stereotype them on purpose. It is very easy to hurt people when they are stereotyped. It is always a good idea to do some research if you do not know anything about that group of pe."
"The trinity teaches that there is one divine essence that exists in three persons, not that one person equals three. Also I do not think God is a human invention. If we believe that we exist because of matter and chance then how could we trust our own minds? There would be no reason to trust our own mind since there is no absolute truth. Also everyone has a sense of right and wrong, well again evil could not exist if there was no truth, and God is our truth. I think it is pretty hard to make say God is a human invention and then have no explanation for the creation around us."
"In fact there is some strong evolutionary evidence supporting this claim as Leutwyler/live science REFERENCE studied five-month-old babies, demonstrating how we react emotionally to songs at such a young age. When these young babies were exposed to sad music, usually a slow tempo and written in a minor key, they made an emotionally neutral face. However, when exposed to \u2018Ode to Joy\u2019 from Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony (a suggestive happy song due to its fast tempo and because it\u2019s written in a major key), the babies smiled and stared at the face for three to four seconds long, suggesting they were interested in the sounds."
"I think that what Jean Piaget said is correct because in my point of view children learn when they are active. By looking into detail about what Jean Piaget believed in, Teena Kamen states in her book that \u201cJean Piaget believed that, children are actively involved in structuring their own cognitive development through exploration of their environment. Children need real objects and concrete experiences to discover things for themselves\u201d (2000, pg96). This statement made by Teena Kamen about what Jean Piaget believed supports my recommendations made in E8."
"Old people were poor in the 1920\u2019s because they were seen as useless by the average people and the government alike. This indicates that American society greatly believed in the term \u2018survival of the fittest\u2019 and believed people should \u2018work until they dropped.\u2019 After Lennie leaves the ranch Candy replaces his role and becomes dependent on George: \u201cWhat we gonna do now George? What we gonna do now?\u201d"
"Cognitively, Ahmad is still apart of the cognitive development stage. Ahmad shows an increase in memory for routines. For example, eating and sleeping. Ahmad also recognizes people and faces, not only in real life, but also in photos. As Ahmad reached closer to two years old, his parents saw some early signs of ADHD that they kept an eye out for as he developed. Ahmad was having difficulty paying attention and was fidgeting and squirming a lot more than usual. They did not know if this was normal for toddlers or if Ahmad was developing ADHD so they decided that they would bring it up to the pediatrician at the next visit."
"It makes the audience aware of the impact that surprising shots have and how they keep you engrossed in the film. Editing is also used to give the audience a better understanding of the set as it helps them to see things from different camera positions. When Derek\u2019s father is waiting in the House of Commons to hear a response about the appeal, he is standing all alone in a huge entrance hall. The immensity of this room is shown by the arrangement and complexity of different camera angles. The audience start to emphasise with Mr Bentley as it creates the feeling of isolation; such a small and bewildered man compares to the size of the hallway."
"As women undertake the majority of household tasks, they simply cannot work \u201cflexibly\u201d according to company demands as men have done. As the result, \u201cMost women are then sorted into a \u201ccareer interruption course:\u201d staying at home when they give birth to children and start childcare, then re-entry into the labor force when childcare duties lighten.\u201d"
"Both articles address the abuse Ruby experienced but in very different ways. The Social Studies for kids article alludes to how cruel these adults were to Ruby but definitely not in as much detail. The article for kids states, \u201cSomeone in that angry mob threatened to poison Ruby\u2019s food, so she brought her own food to school. Other people found other ways to try to unnerve Ruby.\u201d The level of abuse experienced by Ruby involved so much more. However, I believe the authors motives for writing it this way was to appeal to his younger audience. The NPR article had many more references related to the mental and verbal abuse Ruby endured. Ruby clearly states in her interview that she had no idea why they were yelling and screaming at her and the various things they would bring to torment her. Ruby Bridges states \u201d I turned that corner and saw them and heard them, I thought I had stumbled into the middle of a Mardi Gras parade.\u201d Ruby\u2019s perception of those type of events was probably necessary to help her get through such a divided time in our world. Ruby also gives us a vivid description of another time fear set in. She stated, \u201d I was afraid because on occasion the crowd would bring a box, and this box was actually a baby\u2019s coffin. And they would put this black doll inside of the coffin.\u201d I can only imagine how she felt after seeing that. Since she was only six years old she probably played with dolls like the one they put in the coffin and once she realized that the doll represented her and they were talking about killing her, how she was able to continue to go to school and learn is unimaginable."
"Ultimately, we as teachers need to nurture students, and expose them to a variety of learning styles, despite our own preferences, enabling them to become independent learners. Children are less flexible and cannot easily adapt to unfamiliar learning styles, so it is incumbent upon the teacher, to adapt and modify teaching methods, activities and environments in order to create interest, thereby stimulate and motivate a student\u2019s desire to learn."
"I divided the article into four parts. The first part briefly describes what animal experiments are, the second part is the pros and cons of animal experiments, the third part is how to reduce the harm caused by animal experiments to animals, and the fourth part is personal opinions and to sum up."

The second wave caused the brain drain phenomenon that sucked the professionals and bright minds out of the country in exchange for high-paying jobs and generous scholarships (Garchitorena, p. 1).

"This compares to \u2018On my first Sonne'(OM)where the father experiences extreme grief on account of the broken connection between him and his Son. Ben Jonson describes his son as \u201c[his] right hand and joy\u201d and is evidently proud of his heir. However the poet makes what he feels is a fundamental realisation that his Son infact belongs to God. He actually feels that it was wrong of him to put \u201ctoo much hope in thee[his son]."
"There is considerable diversity in what different countries and firms take to be acceptable corporate practices. Each country may have its own financial standards which must be integrated with the IFRS such that the result is complete diversity in corporate practices. Financial reporting needs are highly affected by legal factors, environmental and cultural influences in different countries. Even when over one hundred countries have endorsed IFRS, there is still no uniformity in how different countries apply the standards."
"My brother is the manager of a super store. He has being using paper base spread sheet so he writes his information on paper, This very easy to lose the problem with the store is that they need a spreadsheet so they would be able to re correct their information instead of writing every thing all over again and also this would show how much profit that they have made."
"Studies have drawn attention to the vital role mothers have in safeguarding the health and nutritional wellbeing of their children. However, little is known about mothers\u2019 experiences and challenges in fulfilling this role in rapidly urbanizing cities. Hence this study aim to explore the experiences of child care and feeding amongst mothers with children under five years of age in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Thirty-six semi-structured in-depth interviews were carried out with mothers who had children under five years of age. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim in Amharic and translated into English."
"The perspectives of individuals and their relationships with each other and their lives and identity have been examined by Castelino (2009) and the focus was on family violence intervention programs. The study was on men\u2019s behavior change as they worked closely with their partners or children for their own safety. Within this organizational context, the children\u2019s experiences at home with domestic violence have not been explored and although there is a framework for engaging in therapeutic work, the context of family violence tends to highlight work exploring safety and well being along with the complexity of family environment. The children\u2019s experiences in domestic violence situations have been considered as significantly important. Berrick (2009) has argued that child welfare in the US is in a state of crisis and intense family problems such as drug addiction, domestic violence and"
"In Brazil, hot car deaths are also a problem. This alone shows that the incidents can happen anywhere, not just the USA. This also shows that this is a worldwide problem, not constrained to one area. Finally, in Brazil, the research shows that forgetting is the most common cause of vehicular hyperthermia, so we should also make sure parents know that they\u2019re vulnerable to this tragedy, too. In Brazil, we found that increasing awareness of this problem through education is highly recommended."
"While there is turmoil and stress in taking care of Arnie, he is an internal strength for this family. In looking at this family through the Bowen Family Theory, triangulation is formed between two antagonistic individuals also, linked to a third party that creates the calming effect between all individuals that are in conflict (McTiller, 2009). It is often this third party that provides a sense of homeostasis within the family unit. Homeostasis is a concept relating the balance and equilibrium within the family unit that regulates and maintains the system cohesion (Hepworth, 2010). There is consistent turmoil between Gilbert and his sisters regarding Arnie. During this time of turmoil Gilbert leaves the family but always returns because of Arnie, creating the family homeostasis once again."
"My main sources, the research paper by Aura Korppi-Tommola and \u201c70 000 pient kohtaloa\u201d (70 000 small destinies) by Pertti Kaven, will be discussed in detail later on. Besides these I also used other texts, memoirs, newspaper articles, video documents, interviews, annual reports and essays in the Internet to get a good foundation for the actual essay."
"They rarely set their sights beyond the present, which explains younger teens\u2019 inability to consider the long-term consequences of their actions. The step of development is dependent on how much direction is given with regard to helping the brain to make the assembly between knowledge and practical application in daily life. By late adolescence, many youngsters have come to appreciate subtleties of tuitions and ideas, and to project into the future. They start to take personal responsibility for employment, finances and accommodation."
"\u201cCriminal identity theft occurs when someone else cited or arrested for a criminal act uses another person\u2019s name and identifying information, resulting in a criminal record being created in that person\u2019s name\u201d. When such a thing takes place, the victim of criminal identity theft can suffer hurdles with law enforcement forces or be unable to gain employment, and might also need to clear his/her name from the police records."
"Cowardice, absence without leave, desertion, insubordination, shirking under enemy fire and disobeying orders were often considered punishable by the Nazis. Last but not least the contemporary era, or better said, the present day. Nowadays, capital punishment has been eradicated in a lot of countries, but there still countries that believe in this type of punishment like China, India and the United States. They use methods like the electric chair and the lethal injection."

The occurrence of Fog is dramatically higher within urban areas, the great increase in the amount of fog within cities is in accordance with the industrialisation of the city, e.g. In London 1700 there was 29 days of fog but by the 1800 (industrial revolution had occurred) there was over 50 days of"
"b) Well my opinion is I\u2019m kind of happy that I am perceived as someone who can and has the will to succeed. And that if I screw up it will only be on me not on my whole race. However it is screwed up because I know a lot of students of color who deserve more than I or any other student (white and asian) have because they work harder."
"It has been said that power inevitably leads to corruption, and it is yet to be recognized that , while there is no reason to suppose that policemen as individuals are any less fallible than other members of society, people are often shocked and outraged when policemen are exposed to violating the law. Not only should officers use brutality in very limited situations, I think that it would help requiring officers to file a written report after any use of physical force, regardless of how seemingly insignificant. Although, if every incidence of police abuse was requested to be reported, how many actually would be? Maybe only those serious enough, as depicted in new guidelines, would make it, leaving some space for officers to exert pressure without crossing serious and abusive policy. Another good tactic to control police brutality is to establish a system to identify officers who have been involved in an inordinate number of incidents that include the inappropriate use of physical force."
"Rising temperatures are having major effects in several different areas and aspects of the world. An increase in more powerful tropical storms, wildfires, and rising water levels will change the world that we live in today. A.

Life as you know it will never be the same II. Close with impact: No matter how much you try to ignore Global Warming the earth as we know it is in a lot of trouble."
"Talking to another student while the teacher is trying to teach or trying to finish something important is not good and disrespectful for many reasons, not only to the teacher but also to the rest of the class. One of the main reasons that talking in class while we are not supposed to is disrespectful is because the teacher is in charge of the class and we are supposed to follow directions correctly."
"How well a military institution works rely on how the information is passed from the high rank to the lower rank. Rush (2006) defines the chain as \u2018the succession of commanders from a superior to a subordinate through which command is exercised\u2019 (p.32). American system of military embraces only one chain of command which is parallel with NCO; however, NCO complements this chain through its support channels. Basically, this chain of command is essential for communication between senior and junior staff in the Army and for it to be effective then the NCO support channels must be operational (p. 32). The non-commissioned officer support for the channel mentioned above starts with the command sergeant major and ends with junior cadre of NCO. This support channels functions by direct oral communication through the command sergeant major or first sergeant (Rush, 2006, p.33). Besides, this channel is very vital and is applied in giving out orders and ensuring that all jobs are done."
"If a co-worker is suddenly stressed and tearful for no apparent reason, it could mean that they are in a depressive state, and maybe counseling would be a possible option for them to consider, and they could be approached by a close colleague to make this suggestion, in an appropriate and sympathetic manner."
"He is awaiting trail and could face up to 20 years. Being that he targeted Spanish individuals, he could be charged with a hate crime. In conclusion, Police misconduct is low in the United States because most officers know that they are held at a high level than most members in society, and should be setting a positive example. Police officers also know that just because they have more powers than most individuals they should not be taking advantage of them to benefit personally. Although police misconduct is still a problem that will never totally be fixed, police departments should have harder rules and enforce the law harder on law enforcement officers. By letting Officers retire so they don\u2019t lose their pension before they go on trial to me is wrong and not a way to stop police misconduct."
"Research shows through, The Impact of Divorce on Young Children and Adolescents by Carl E Pickhardt, how divorce introduces a massive change into the life of a boy or girl no matter what the age. Witnessing loss of love between parents, having parents break their marriage commitment, adjusting to going back and forth between two different households, and the daily absence of one parent while living with the other, all create a challenging new family circumstance in which to live. In the personal history of the boy or girl, parental divorce is a watershed event. Life that follows is significantly changed from how life was before. He says, somewhat different responses to this painful turn of events occur if the boy or girl is still in childhood or has entered adolescence. Basically, divorce tends to intensify the child\u2019s dependence and it tends to accelerate the adolescent\u2019s independence; it often elicits a more regressive response in the child and a more aggressive response in the adolescent. Consider why this variation may be so."

"By the use of detail, readers are able to find out that as a result of his father\u2019s extended absence, a number of suitors have begun to take free reign over their home and all of their property, seeking to marry the possible widow. Homer uses diction in order to indicate the Telemoakhos\u2019 animosity towards his father:"
"Racism has not only had bad effects on the lives of the people discussed in the story. It is because of racism, Braithwaite landed the job as a Teacher, and was able to transform the lives of the students, who were free disciples into people who could function and live in the world, without conflict or disagreement. Braithwaite knew that schoolbook teachings could not be related and with no relation to their lives, it was useless, so he discussed with them freely about disclosed topics like relationships, and through the ignorance of the students\u2019 taunts towards him and the careful teachings, and his knowledge of knowing their background \u2013 that they were students who were poor, were surrounded by social vermin, prostitutes and bad influences and went to bed, sometimes hungry, he was able to win the hearts of all his students."
