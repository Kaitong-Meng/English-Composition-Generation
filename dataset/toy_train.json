"They want a ban on all firearms. But that is not the solution, the solution is the education of every person that purchases a firearm and required trigger locks, and stricter compliance by judges to the sentences mandated for crimes involving firearms. The \u201cmost recent attempt at federal gun legislation was the Gun Control Act of 1968\u201d (Goldwater 183) and has done little if anything to lower the number of crimes committed using firearms. In fact, \u201cthe number of shooting homicides per year has climbed steadily since it\u2019s enactment, while armed robberies have increased 60 percent.\u201d (183). Now, this is a staggering piece of information. But it\u2019s just one piece of evidence that shows that gun control laws are only marginally effective, if at all, in curtailing crimes involving firearms. Now, I am not saying that there should be absolutely no restrictions on who has a fire arm, because that is not true."
"This is one of many precautions that are already taken involving the dispersion of firearms in America. Guns are not just thrown freely to the public with the message, \u201cDo as You Please.\u201d However, people break laws. Consider all the things that are illegal today, such as marijuana. Incidentally, almost anyone knows someone who uses marijuana and even be able to get their hands on some. The same goes for guns. Even if they were made completely illegal, they would still be here."
"Guns do not kill people, people kill people. Guns are not the problem today. Criminals will kill regardless of gun banning. Before guns were created, people were killing people. Yes, a gun is a deadly weapon and yes people are killed from gun related incidents every day, but guns do not have the ability to harm anyone on their own. It is true that some of the largest mass murders have been shootings. Many tragedies have occurred because of one person with a gun (Refuting). However, those murderers would not have been stopped if a good guy with a gun didn\u2019t stop them."
"Furthermore, armed students would not be able to stop a mass shooting. Besides, if weapons were to become easy available, it would result unintended consequences such as common disputes, enmity and jealousy to each other, self-harm, and reckless behavior that will make college campuses less safe and harmful. College students need to study, enjoying the end of their childhood and living the brightest and most carefree time of their lives. Giving the right to carry concealed weapons on college campuses is dangerous and irresponsible step that would lead to tragic results. So, it is very important to have police officers on campuses to support safety of the students and the teachers and create really safe environment for learning."
"Another common argument against repealing the Second Amendment and gun control in general is that firearms are needed for self defense, this argument is very common within the pro-gun party. Even the National Rifle Association\u2019s Executive Vice President, Wayne LaPierre, has spoken out about guns being vital to defend people\u2019s lives. LaPierre claimed that \u2018The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun.\u2019 (The Week Staff) In other words LaPierre believes that firearms are a necessity when it comes to defense against a bad guy. Not only does the pro-gun party support the belief of guns being needed for self defense but even the Vice President of the largest gun rights group with a huge influence in the political world openly expresses this idea. The problem with LaPierre\u2019s conclusion is that it came from his research of 6,000 over the phone surveys which were given to firearm rights supporters, meaning it is very likely that the survey takers would be biased and could have lied about their experiences with the use of guns for self defense in an attempt to protect their gun rights. Not only is his evidence inaccurate due to its biased survey takers but there is also lots of other more critical research that proves that firearms do not help with self defense. The Violence Policy Center released federal data about firearm use in 2014 and the American new source HuffPost summarized some of the main points of the data. According to the Huffpost \u201cOnly 1.1 percent of victims or intended victims of a violent crime used a firearm in self-defense.\u201d (Sugarmann) Meaning that out of all of the incidents that required self defense in 2014 only 1.1 percent actually used a firearm to help protect them, if guns are so vital and helpful in self defense situations then that rate should be way higher. The same study also concluded that for every person who kills another due to self defense there are 34 people who die for no reason such as a death from a mass shooting. Not only are firearms statistically unneeded for self defense, contrary to the belief of some, but the number of innocent lives lost trumps the deaths due to a defense incident. Guns are also used more in criminal acts then in defense, \u201cUsing data from a national random-digit-dial telephone survey of over 1,900 adults conducted in 1996, these researchers found that criminal gun use is far more common than self-defense gun use.\u201d (Hemenway and Azrael) In other words a firearm is more likely to be used against you in an attack then to be used as a self defense method which means instead of helping fight against criminal attacks, firearms are increasing the threat of them. Luckily though since self defense is important firearms aren\u2019t the only weapon for self defense, and there are other methods that can be just as effective plus these alternative weapons can be taken into areas where guns may be prohibited. According to the website Marine Approved the top weapon for self defense is Salt Supply Long Range Pepper Spray meaning firearms aren\u2019t even the top option for keeping yourself safe. Not only are guns statistically not needed or used for self defense in the past they are also not even the most effective weapon as they are illegal in many areas. Though many would like to believe and argue that fire-arms are essential to protecting yourself years of research show that this is not true, meaning that the right to bear arms is not needed by U.S citizens in that sense."
"During that time, the Federal government was pushed to implement a feries of gun control policies by the waging wars of the gangs of the 1920\u2019s. In 1934, the National Firearms Act was enacted with intent to prevent the spread of destructive firearms that had become increasingly destructive in gang violence. In more recent years passed, the \u201cGun Show Loophole\u201d has been an issue in which there is a loophole in the laws for obtaining a gun at gun shows, as the name suggests."
"Firearms are very useful and have saved many lives. The sad fact is that even though they can be used for good things, people have also found many ways to use this great invention to be harmful to people and property. Ever since guns were invented, they have been used against people and caused injuries. The right of free speech, the right to defend oneself, the right to go freely about one\u2019s business without harassment, the right freely to associate, and the right to private property and due process, were all considered so obvious that many during the ratification process of the Constitution thought them unnecessary to enumerate CITE"
"The National Rifle Association (NRA) has pushed for laws on gun rights and laws that force universities and colleges to allow guns on campuses. The NRA has proposed, campaigns and lobbied for the government to change laws on guns. For example, after the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in 2013. \u201cPresident Barack Obama supported reinstating the ban on assault weapons, and majority of Americans favored stricter gun control after 20 children and six adults were killed by a gunman using a semiautomatic weapon. The NRA started a \u2018Stop the Gun Ban\u2019 campaign even before the bill was introduced. It failed in the Senate, 60 to 40\u201d (Gerhart). Even before the bill was introduced to Congress the NRA influenced the Senate to vote against the bill. Many States have rejected the NRA\u2019s agenda, despite the push to allow guns on campuses (\u201cGuns on Campus\u201d)."
"It will be less mass shooting if stricter guns purchase occurs. Americans who were support background checks before individuals purchase guns at guns shows, number who agree with it are 65% and still increasing (Pew Research Center). A survey by the Pew Research Center shows that the United States is in the most intense conflict in the last 20 years. Southerners also strongly support gun ownership. Similarly, large coastal cities on the East and West coasts are vehemently opposed to guns while the Far West, with farm owners, farmers, miners, loggers, and independent groups respect and need guns for various purposes. (Pew Researching center)."
"The text states: universities are allowed to \u201cestablish rules, regulations, or other provisions\u201d regarding \u201c(d) storage of handguns in dormitories or other residential facilities that are owned or leased and operated by the institution and located on the campus of the institution\u201d or \u201c(d-1) after consulting with students staff, and faculty of the institution\u2026carrying of concealed handguns by license holders on the campus of the institution or on premises located on the campus of the institution."
"Elementary and middle schools ban innocent children from even creating a figure of a gun with their mere fingers, yet mentally unstable adults are allowed to carry guns around as they please. In a nation where even Wal-Mart is selling guns, it is no wonder why these dangerous machines of destruction often fall into the wrong hands. It is evidently clear that the few pros of lean gun control do not substantiate its public danger. Consider today\u2019s generation. The majority also plays video games such as Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty."
"Even with the cracked legislative windows, the possibility of congressional action remains somewhat remote. Years of intense local initiatives and legal battles have forced different groups to straighten their priorities (Haynes 1). Blaming objects such as guns take away the blame from individuals for their moral choices. Some supporters of gun control base their positions on the belief that legislations would reduce crime while others are motivated by their disdain for gun owners (Wagner and Machnowski 1). Even more are reluctant to condemn groups for their actions and make guns their substitute scapegoat. Rather than use guns as scapegoats, there is a need for the factual basis upon which policy is based. It does not mean basing decisions on facts about policies that are capable of reducing homicides or suicides (Wagner and Machnowski 1). It means basing decisions on the accurate understanding of trade-offs behind each policy."
"Some employees call on the government to stop selling guns after the school shootings. Gun-related deaths are now the third-related causes of death in America. An average of 19 children die from gunshot wounds or are treated in hospital emergency rooms every day, with boys, teenagers, and Afican Americans disproportionately affected, according to a new study that claims to be the most comprehensive analysis of childhood firearm deaths and injuries. People who are affected by guns, guns are the third leading causes of death, and people die everyday because of guns"
"You don\u2019t want to create a situation that isn\u2019t necessary so you huddle next to your bed and hope whomever it is takes what they want and leaves. You hear them walking down the hallway toward you. Your bladder nearly lets go. The intruder tries to open your door but luckily you locked it."
"Although the relationship between mental illness and gun control is not black and white, most anti-gun supporters would agree that individuals with mental illness should not possess a gun. Individuals who are diagnosed mentally ill are easier to identify than those who are untreated and/or unevaluated. Wolf and Rosen (2015) found, \u201cRecent gun control legislation targets the mentally ill which exacerbates the stigma about violence and mental illness and may deter individuals from seeking the care they need\u201d. This quote means that mentally ill individuals will not seek treatment in fear that they will not be legally able to possess a gun. The question that immediately comes to mind is how many mentally unstable individuals possess a gun? This concept is frightening and the thought that mentally ill people possess guns is overwhelming."
"The third piece of evidence shows that there is no evidence to support that gun control laws are effective in slowing gun violence. According to the \u201cRight to bear arms\u201d article, there is currently no evidence to support that gun control laws are effective in slowing gun violence.\u201d It has also been recorded that in 2010, the frequency of gun related crimes rose after a section of laws were put into effect. As the 3rd and final reason that gun control laws are ineffective is because the gun reports that follow gun homicides have costed the government millions of dollars to fill out. Those millions that could have gone to bettering police forces to make the nation a better place."
"The Supreme Court unanimously held the prohibition of sawed off shot guns in 1939.(Stevens,2018,para. 4)The government extremists jump from regulating to trying to repeal the amendment itself entirely. In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled against repealing the 2nd amendment in Heller v District of Columbia. Well known contractualist John Locke made a point to note how the state of nature was not bad, but citizens needed to secure their property. (Roskin, M. G., Cord, R. L., Medeiros, J. A., & Jones, W. S.,2017). A long standing way to secure ones property is with their right to bare arms, if we lose that right, who or what is to stop the unlawful people from taking what they want, when and how they want, whether it results in the loss of a life or not. Contactualist believe in the \u201csocial contract\u201d, our primary contract being the Constitution. In an article written in the New York Times by former Supreme Justice, John Paul Stevens, he insists that demonstrators \u201cseek more effective and lasting reform\u201d, by demanding a repeal of the 2nd amendment. Ironic how a former Supreme Court Judicial, whose responsibility was to interpret whether legislations proposed fall within the lines of the Constitution, would welcome such ideas that entertain criminal behavior in itself. The highest law of the land, the Constitution, is to be upheld by the Supreme Court, not undermined by it."
"The entire Second Amendment states: \u201ca well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.\u201d [53] The federal 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, in the Dec. 11, 2012 case Moore v. Madigan, ruled 2-1 that the Second Amendment\u2019s right to bear arms \u201cmust be interpreted to include a right to have a concealed gun in public, to have it ready for use, and to have it for self-defense.\u201d [54] The US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Peruta vs. San Diego by a 2-1 vote on Feb. 13, 2014 that the Second Amendment requires states to \u201cpermit some form of concealed carry for self-defense outside the home\u201d (\u201cConcealed Guns ProCon.org\u201d). The constitution of the United States of America protects our rights and gives us guidelines to new law making. In 2014, the 2nd amendment will be approximately 223 years old and has been our milestone since the beginning which makes some people not want to have a gun control law."
"Most of these places being the last that one would think he or she would spend their final moments on earth. I believe less government involvement in gun control is key to keeping our 2nd amendment intact, following the Libertarianism ideology and using the contractualist theory, to refrain from the infringement of our rights our forefathers set out for citizens more than 223 years ago."
"So why would you want to force someone who doesn\u2019t want to carry the gun into carrying it that may lead into false alarms. Allowing this would add the danger to students in to facing it rather than reducing the fear. Most school systems have done a bad job in preparing teachers and students for classroom situations like this. Another, women who was interview thought the idea was pointless because she was more worried about the students who have mental health issues need emotional support on how to deal with situations like this. She said\u2026 \u201cI don\u2019t need a gun; I need lawmakers who put students lives before a civilian right to an assault rifle. As a teacher of children, I have gotten to know many kids who need mental health support but can\u2019t get it due to lack of resources. Students need emotional support on how to deal with trauma and anger. We need our students to feel say, and they want if the school is loaded down with guns.\u201d Ashely teaches 4th grade in Illinois."
"On the other hand, the opposition argues that concealed carry on college campuses could deter mass shooting sprees. They argue that having guns on campus could deter students and teachers from going out on massive shootings on college campus. According to Students for Concealed Carry (SCC) they state, \u201cCampus shooters go on armed rampages because they misguidedly seek to make a point or attain infamy.\u201d (652). They further point out that having other concealed carry holders might deter a few campus shooters and it could potentially prevent them from going on massive shootings. Bringing concealed carry on college campus could deter shooters, but it could also put the lives of students and staff at risk as well. SGFS points out two shootings that have had armed police officer and still went on shootings even if the police officers were present (642). SCC explains that even if there were armed police officers present and still did not deter the shooters it still led to fewer deaths. This might be true however if concealed carry was allowed it would still not deter other shooters from going on massive shootings even if other licensed concealed carry holders were present. The SCC also states, \u201cThe question of whether or not concealed carry would deter would-be-mass-shooters should not be the determining factor in whether or not it is allowed on college campus.\u201d (653). This means that the SCC thinks that they should not just focus on the fact it could potential create mass shooters but to look at it as it could reduce the number of massive shootings. SCC goes on and explains, that if a person was allowed the same right to defend himself outside of the campus then why is a person allowed the same right while he is at campus (653). This shows that people inside of school should be offered the same amount of protection that they are getting while being on college campus. Although this makes a fair point guns being present on college campus would still not deter students and staff. The possibility of gun shootings would decrease if guns were not allowed on campus so why should we take the risk of allowing guns. Concealed carry on college campus would not deter students and staff instead it makes the chances of college shootings more likely if guns were in the presence of them."
"Repealing the 2nd Amendment will take away gun rights from all U.S citizens, many Americans assume that all mass shooters have a diagnosed mental illness and therefore we should only take away gun rights from the mentally ill. This is because many Americans cannot cope with the fact that somebody would be capable of inflicting such pain without being mentally insane. In that sense, many believe we just need to make our background checks for buying firearms stronger so those who are mentaly ill don\u2019t have access to them. The book Gun Violence and Mental Illness by, psychiatrists Liza Gold and Robert Simon explores the connection between mass shooters and mental illness. The website The Behavioral Scientist explains their key points and ideas by stating \u201cIn their 2016 edited book Gun Violence and Mental Illness, psychiatrists Liza Gold and Robert Simon summarize the evidence debunking the myth that mental illness is a leading cause of gun violence. As they report, less than 5% of shootings are committed by people with a diagnosable mental illness.\u201d (Rai) Meaning 95% of mass shooters do not have a diagnosed mental illness, contrary to popular belief, they also explain that a mentally ill person is more likely to kill somebody they know or themselves than a stranger. This means that if we were to only take away the right to bear arms from the mentally ill, we would not solve our gun issue because the majority of mass shooters would still have gun rights. If we are unable to generalize about mass shootings and find a specific group to target with gun control, the only viable solution would be to enforce some sort of solution on everybody. A drastic problem like this needs a drastic solution and repealing the Second Amendment would take away all U.S citizens gun rights, and is the solution the United States needs."
"According to The Wall Street Journal, \u201cJohn R. Lott, Jr., PhD, gun rights activist, stated, \u201cThe problem with such [gun control] laws is that they take away guns from law abiding citizens, while would-be criminals ignore them\u201d (Lott). This quote shows how gun control will only affect people who follow the law because those who do not will not care to follow the gun laws. In conclusion, gun control is not necessary because people aren\u2019t usually killed by guns, people will still find ways to get guns, and it will weaken the defense of citizens who want to protect themselves. Gun control will overall hurt the law abiding citizens rather than help them. This will put our nation at risk."
"This would send the wrong message to young students in my classroom. I would never want my students to believe that concealed weapons in our classroom are necessary to be safe. My values are not for sale, and therefore and monetary compensation would not change my opinion on this matter.\u201d- Alex, 27, teaches 1st grade in Chicago, IL."
"Sandy Hook, a private/elite elementary school in an upscale suburb of a quiet town in Connecticut; 28 dead. The Borderline Bar in Thousand Oaks, California; a suburban LA college bar; 12 dead. Fort Hood Military Hospital, a secure facility on a well-guarded military base in Texas; 13 dead. An outdoor concert, on the Strip in Las Vegas, with metal detectors, security screenings, and dozens of armed police officers; 59 dead! A guy walks up to a bunch of Congressman practicing softball for a charity benefit game (in Washington DC) with armed Capitol Police watching. The arbitrary nature of these events demonstrates the complexity of this issue. In this immediate gratification world, we live in (smart phones, amazon overnight, inflight wifi etc.) we demand answers and wanted quick decisive solutions by an expert on what I have to do to solve this and move on. There are people on all the news shows telling me that this is simple, they know the answer. And of course it starts with a catch phrase; \u201cif we make guns illegal, only criminals will have guns!\u201d or \u201cthey can take my gun\u2026 from my cold dead hands!\u201d This triggers the first problem; emotion, emotion complicates everything. We can all agree that gun violence is bad. A kid walking into school and killing other innocent kids is horrible. Right, Left, Conservative, Liberal there is complete agreement that these acts are evil. It\u2019s all over the news, parents screaming in anguish, fellow innocents crying and holding candle light vigils with flowers and stuffed animals."
"And finally if a gun is deemed unable to be registered this restricts an individual\u2019s ability to bear that specific arm. Previously in the similar case of District of Columbia v. Heller the Supreme Court ruled that the second amendment did indeed protect individuals, as long as they were on or in federal property within the state."
"Even though I agreed with Clinton\u2019s gun and same-sex marriage point in paragraph two does not mean I want her as president. Clinton has downfalls too. It is important to vote to get your vote count and to make you voice by heard. But I feel like this year everyone is voting for the candidate who they do not want instead of who they do want to become president and that is just sad. Also, I know there is a lot of people not voting because of the candidates who are running. I am scared to see who will become president."
"In conclusion, guns are not the problem in America. A gun is an inanimate object, just as a car is, but put in the hands of the wrong person it can be a deadly weapon. Americans are not running wild, waiting to take down the government with their semi-automatic weapons. Not only is owning a gun a safety measure for some people, but there are recreational activities that involve guns. Plenty of families spend time together shooting guns, as a family activity. Guns have been here since America has been, so have criminals. Get rid of the criminals, not the guns."
"Since its foundation, the United States has always placed emphasis on liberty and equality. Arguably, the United States is heavily known around the world for the culture it has built around freedom. To this day, one of the most prominent freedoms given to civilians is the right to bear arms. Included in the first 10 amendments of the United States\u2019 constitution, also known as the Bill of Rights, the 2nd amendment states \u201dA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
"The GFC softened demand throughout world markets, hurting export-based industries (Forestry Tasmania 2011, Gunns Limited 2010). Furthermore, the collapse of the demand for managed investment products as a realist of the GFC caused the divestment of the initiative by the same name directed by Gunns, spurring further financial losses (Gunns Limited 2010, Gunns Limited 2011a)."
"In other words, guns are an incredible invention made for the men to defend themself in case necessary. Do not misunderstand the original purpose for which one was created with the different use that we are giving to them nowadays. Violence generate more violence. We need to give ourselves the opportunity to be better persons and humans being. It is imperative that we wake up for this nightmare that we are having right now as soon as possible, if we do not reconsider the way that we are acting fast, the final consequences will not be only for us but for the entire humanity. Because as P.G said \u201cThe fascination of shooting as a sport depends almost wholly on whether you are at the right or wrong end of the gun.\u201d"
"Moreover, deciding what can be considered viable steps towards the right direction isn\u2019t based on gun control at all, according to Wilson. Although proponents of gun control will also argue that stricter punishments for gun related crimes this comes at a price per the author. He argues that the \u201c\u2026tougher the prospective sentence the less likely it is to be imposed\u2026\u201d(Wilson 127). He continues with more generalized statements, this time with no evidence, in support of his opinion. I consider this to be another fallacy from Wilson because it comes off as unsupported theories rather than conclusive facts from a credible source. As a result, I believe that there is an argument that can be made to implement harsher punishments to gun related crimes. It makes sense, in my opinion, that the general public, which includes would be assailants, would be deterred away from such crimes in fear of the outcome. Thus far, Wilson has opposed every argument for gun control and offers a different way to provide safety to the general public. An ill-advised and undiscovered scientific solution that detects metal from longer ranges than a standard metal detector. This yet to be conceived invention with \u201c\u2026reasonable grounds for a pat down.\u201d(Wilson 128) This idea exposes Wilson\u2019s inability to unbiasedly argue against gun regulations which hampers his argument in the end."
"For an example, Las Vegas shooting, A mass murder killed 58 people and 489 wounded. According to washingtonpost.com \u201cThe Las Vegas shooter modified a dozen rifles to shoot like automatic weapons. Law enforcement officials said Tuesday at least a dozen of the 23 firearms recovered in Las Vegas were semiautomatic rifles and HIGH CAPACITY Magazine legally modified to fire like automatic weapons, using an alteration known as a bump fire stock.\u201d \u201cThose components used together in a weapon suggest a desire to shoot large amounts of automatic-like fire into masses of people without much concern for accuracy, as the recoil from a simulated automatic fire would make it difficult to hit specific targets at a long range."
"-Buying fire arms should be the same as buying a vehicle: The lawmakers could learn lessons from auto-safety. They could create more thorough requirements for owning fire arms. A policy that would be more effective, would be to require every buyer to obtain a (gun) license that should include registration of all of their purchases and also a training program."
"To possess a gun, one should not think of it as a right of passage but as a greater responsibility. The overall gun violence in the United States in the 21st century is at its highest level, even higher than other similar countries. What is the purpose of a gun and what is gun control? This is simple, a gun is used to eliminate the threat, gun control is to eliminate the senseless mass shootings, innocent victims of gun violence and prevention of gun possession by people incapable of knowing the difference between the two, which is why the government should implement stricter gun laws."
"To begin, author James Q. Wilson compares the public\u2019s stance on gun control and the government\u2019s stance. During the time of publication, 1994, president Bill Clinton and the public advocated for stricter gun control laws in hopes of reducing crimes resulting in gun violence. Although they both support gun control the president believes it will work while the public does not. From here the topic of our essay begins as James Q. Wilson begins to support the public\u2019s perception of gun control."
"B.I. that she feared he would become a school shooter, listing specific examples of disturbing conduct \u2014 including holding a gun to the head of family members.\u201d (Rubio). With this hard evidence against this criminal the authorities still chose to do nothing which is why a red flag law would be somewhat helpful in reducing gun violence. A red flag law would give the ability to restrict certain individuals that are unstable, and potentially violent to have restricted gun access for a period of time."
"Gunns has effectively addressed the sociocultural myopia that was damaging the reputation and performance of the company by engaging more openly with the community. This management of the demographic changes the company has undergone has the potential to give the company a strategic advantage (Strack et. al 2008). The company must be careful, however, to not allow future sociocultural forces that are not commercially viable influence the company to the extent that any competitive advantage is lost. The current situation and the addressing of the problem by Gunns exhibits a positive management of this element of the PEST environment, though there is uncertainty in the future. As such, the outlook for this element of the business environment can only be deemed as neutral."
"In conclusion gun violence is a topic that will keep being debated about until the end of time. Guns would never ever be taken away from us Americans since it is our second amendment right. We could implement laws and have bans on guns to reduce it, but gun violence will still occur and if it occurs it will keep being debated about and create a never-ending cycle. We must accept it and try to do all that what we can to prevent gun violence in our country. We live in a cruel world gun violence can happen anywhere at any given time and unfortunately, it\u2019s going to be like that until we pass on."
"This mind-boggling quote simply means that in the United States gun violence is unfortunately higher than other similar countries. Has the government taken a good look at these statistics regarding gun violence and put together a plan of action to greatly reduce the high mortality rate? Arango and Medina (2018) pointed out, \u201cUnfortunately, many background checks are inadequate. Information is not reported or is mishandled; legal ambiguities can make it difficult to know whether events are, in fact, prohibiting. And even where background checks are required, many people avoid them\u201d (p.5). This quote states the root of the problem, which is failure to conduct adequate background checks. Guns are obtained because sellers cannot conduct quality background checks or force individuals to divulge all required information."
"The solution to preventing mentally ill individuals from possessing firearms is by thoroughly investigating applicants and requiring background reports to include voluntary mental health commitments. In researching, another solution was discovered, known as reg flag laws, which remove guns from someone in a temporary crisis. Although mental illness is not a direct indicator of gun violence, the mix of mental illness and guns has greater potential to be deadly. Overall gun violence in the United States is a fact of life and, in 2018, has become a frightening regularity. Proposing stricter laws on gun control would create less gun violence which will lead to fewer gun related deaths. Wintemute (2015) claimed, \u201cCompared with other industrialized nations, the United States has uniquely high mortality rates from firearm violence\u201d."
"Gun control has recently been the center of many political debates as a result of many devastating world wide events. Some argue that all Americans have the right to bare arms while others argue that limiting the availability of firearms will only better American society. These two drastically different views have created conflict for centuries. On December 14 2012 a murderer by the name of Adam Lanza entered Sandy Hook Elementary school with his mother\u2019s assault rifle and brutally murdered 20 children and 6 employees."
"Wilson\u2019s plan to train police officers to be able to spot would be gun carriers more easily, arming the police with hi-tech weapon detectors, , and letting the police keep the authority to \u201cpat down\u201d people suspected with reasonable-suspicion would have too many negative effects to even consider enforcing in the United States. The first part of Wilson\u2019s plan is to train police to be able to spot people that look like they are carrying guns."
"They should feel safe in their homes and schooling environments. While I attended high school in northern New Jersey, I remember hearing about the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. It was an incredibly terrifying moment for me because the Sandy Hook Elementary School was only an hour drive away from where I resided. Adam Lanza, the shooter who was twenty-two, stole one gun of many in his aunt\u2019s house. Adam had several mental disorders including Asperger syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder. He shot twenty children and six staff members in the Sandy Hook Elementary School. Adam also shot his mother on the way to the school and shot himself in the head after the massacre at the elementary school. I was horrified; I never imagined that I would be so closely related to such a devastating incident. I recall hearing about it at school and it was plastered all over the news. There were also memorial services being held for the children and the families affected. The following day, my high school practiced lock down procedures every week in order to be prepare students for the possible event of a shooting. Elementary schools in the county were closed to protect the children from harm\u2019s way."
"In my opinion, the law is an overwhelming failure, mostly because it\u2019s pointless, at best, and dangerous, at worst. Universities have police forces for a reason. It\u2019s likely that, should an issue arise, more students and professors with guns will just cause difficulties for, already on-edge, police officers. This, on top of the previously mentioned issues, shows the risks outweigh the benefits, and because those benefits likely don\u2019t exist, this policy is the antithesis of good policy. The policy must reflect research if we want it to work. \u201cGut-feelings\u201d or Hollywood fantasy have no place in governing the lives of millions."
"The future outlook for the economic environment appears to be positive, a sentiment shared by investors who were quick to purchase the forestry assets divested by Gunns in 2010 (Gunns Limited 2011a). The advantages of operating in a stable domestic economy will be realised once the Australian dollar appreciates to pre-GFC levels and the ill effects of the GFC itself have subsided."
"The time has come, you raise from the side of your bed, instinctively assuming a marksman\u2019s pose and fire just as the intruder is raising his weapon. He flies back against the wall and slumps into a lifeless pile. You then proceed to call 911. Now, that is not an uncommon scenario in the present state of society. Now what I ask you to picture is that same scenario, but this time only the intruder has a weapon because all guns have been outlawed and the criminal is the only person who can get their hands on them. It\u2019s a rather scary thought, isn\u2019t it. But that is exactly what some people want. Read why\u00a0education is the most powerful weapon"
"Gun-rights supporters have their own vision of the way society should work. In that vision, guns play an important part in bolstering individual freedoms and protecting private citizens from both crime and governmental tyranny. Their position is that guns both save lives and reduce crime. Beyond that, gun-rights supporters argue that gun control is just plain unworkable."
"The Second Amendment has become a huge part of both sides of the gun control debate. Both sides have cited what they feel the Founding Fathers meant when they created and wrote the Second Amendment. The purpose of the Second Amendment was to provide the constitutional framework for America\u2019s gun laws. \u201cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed\u201d (Hicks). The Founding Fathers intended that the Amendment\u2019s primary justification was to prevent the United States from needing a standing army. Also, the authors of the Bill of Rights were not concerned with an individual right to bear arms (Shusterman). People who are pro- gun use the second Amendment as textual evidence to claim that individuals have a right to own guns. \u201cBefore the 2008 Supreme Court case District of Columbia vs. Heller, courts ruled that the right of an individual citizen to bear arms existed only within the context of participation in the militia. In Heller, the Supreme Court overturned that precedent, delivering gun rights advocates their biggest legal victory\u201d (Shusterman). After the decision of the Supreme Court, \u201cthe second Amendment meant individuals had an inherent right to own guns for lawful purposes\u201d (Elving)."
"The answer to this question is, guns don\u2019t kill people, people kill people; however, guns make it easier to kill people and often time in great numbers. The government should create stricter laws on gun control and end the senseless mass murders at the hands of individuals in possession of guns. In the United States, it is way too easy to obtain a gun, and with that said, guns end up in the wrong hands. The way to control guns is to make it harder to obtain a gun, lowering the number of deaths caused by guns."
"The son will have to decide whether to risk his life trying to save his family, or hope from a distance his family doesn\u2019t get hurt. People that argue against stricter gun laws believe that guns should be allowed to be used for self defense incase you are ever put into a life-threatening situation. Anyone that was operating the gun should go through the legal procedure to obtain the gun along with have knowledge how to use it properly. The downfall of this is, we don\u2019t know how many people behind those guns are potential criminals and could hurt someone at anytime. \u201cAlthough guns lead to criminal actions and violence it has also been noted to prevent further escalations in crime. There has been much debate in regards to criminals backing down when faced against civilians and law enforcements using guns as self-defense.\u201d \u201cPros & Cons: Gun Control \u2013 The Pros & Cons\u201d) During the Sandy Hook school shooting, if the principal or kindergarten teacher that died trying to protect the children had a gun on hand, the chances of all those poor innocent children getting killed could have been a lot less. someone could have stopped him before anyone had to get hurt. Aside from guns protecting us, the United States Constitution does not exactly state whether guns can be owned individually or just the military and law enforcements, therefore it stirrs up the debate whether we are able to have them or not."
"This quote means that regardless of the tough gun laws, individuals manage to obtain assault weapons and use them maliciously. It appears even if the government does its part by creating harsher laws and penalties for breaking those laws, there is usually some way around the law. President Bill Clinton signed the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, which restricted features on semi-automatic weapons, rifles and shot guns, unfortunately for Americans that law expired in 2004. Steidley and Colen (2017) wrote, \u201cEight years ago this week, the young people in Littleton, Colorado, suffered a horrible attack at Columbine High School\u2026since these killings, we\u2019ve done nothing as a country to end gun violence in our schools and communities. If anything, we\u2019ve made it easier to access powerful weapons\u201d. This quote reflects on the past and explains that nothing to date has been done to rectify the gun control issue which has unfortunately gotten worse."
"In Louisiana, it is even legal to open carry your firearm. It is completely legal as long as your firearm is showing and everyone can see it. Louisiana has always been in and out of the position of being the state with the most homicides or even firearm homicides. Since 1999, over twenty-six thousand teens and children in Louisiana have died because of firearms. It is also proved that the firearm murder rate goes up fifty-percent every year. Guns are also too easy for minors to get their hands on."
"This statement supports the idea that gun control would hinder people from protecting themselves. Some states allow citizens to bear arms for self defense, and enacting gun control will stop them from doing so. Additionally, gun control is not needed because not many people are killed by guns. The article states, \u201cAccording to the CDC\u2019s \u201cLeading Causes of Death Reports,\u201d between 1999 and 2013, Americans were 21.5 times more likely to die of heart disease (9,691,733 deaths); 18.7 times more likely to die of malignant tumors (8,458,868 deaths); and 2.4 times more likely to die of diabetes or 2.3 times more likely to die of Alzheimer\u2019s (1,080,298 and 1,053,207 respectively) than to die from a firearm (whether by accident, homicide, or suicide)\u201d (\u201cData & Statistics\u201d)."
"In lockdowns, all the students hide under the table or in closet or in a corner that makes them become an easier target to the shooter. However, if the teachers are equipped, it won\u2019t be fundamental for the children to shroud that way. Next, after what occurred at Sandy Hook, several kids may feel dangerous to return back to school. If the students realize that the teachers are armed, they will more secure because they have a solution to fight back in an emergency. And that make a safe feeling for students. A teacher or administrator with a firearm can simply defend the campus and their students. Presently, in the event that the shooter , the only method the school system would respond is by shelter in place drills that students and school staffs, teachers lock their entry ways, classrooms doors and remain out of anyone\u2019s ability to see from the hallway . In the event that the intruder bring a firearm, the main thing to block them is locked the classroom door , it can be a strong resistance to maximize the time while waiting to the police. The only way to stop a firearm is a firearm. Several guardians and directors contend that by permitting firearm n schools, students can access the guns and abuse them for many different motivations. Similarly, as teachers and students have approached to weapons, the trespasser also have access to allow them to use weapons of their choice. But the hidden firearm in the school will be put in a safe places. Moreover, teachers and school system will have to apply the strict security of using guns in the school area. Plus, the teachers and school staffs will be more responsible for that, but to defend their students and themselves, they will welcome to the new adjustment."
"This quote shows that guns play a major role in the safety of people, and by implementing gun control it will make it harder for them to protect themselves. Gun control would most likely cause more deaths of American citizens if they have no way to defend themselves from others. The article continues when it states, \u201c Constitutions in 37 US states protect the right to bear arms for self defense, most with explicit language such as Alabama\u2019s: \u2018every citizen has a right to bear arms in defense of himself and the state!\u201d (Volokh)."
"The suicide rate by firearm in Louisiana has grown more than thirty-percent since 1999. Most unintentional deaths by gun are caused by kids playing with guns, or guns being left around and unsupervised. There are even cases when cops have fatally killed a juvenile for mistakenly thinking they had a gun. Cop shootings have even involved older people in fatal shootings. The availability of firearms has a big impact on gun violence. If laws were tightened and parishes and neighborhoods weren\u2019t so lenient on crimes, maybe gun control would be easier to grasp. The youth pass up help these days because they don\u2019t want to be different. If everyone wanted to change at the same time, then most likely gun control wouldn\u2019t even be an issue. At the end of the day, gun violence stems from the government itself."
"Confiscating every firearm is an impossible task and taking away weapons from the law abiding citizens will leave criminals armed while citizens are defenceless. Possibly resulting in a terrible backlash and create more violence throughout the country. Criminals would have a tremendous advantage over the average law abiding citizen. One could break into a home and not worry about the home owner retaliating. Self defense is necessary in today\u2019s violent society and many people who argue against gun control will say that self defense with a firearm is needed in today\u2019s society. Although a recent study conducted by the violence policy center proves the majority of firearm related homicides have nothing to do with self defence. Not to mention that in most cases a firearm intended to be used for self defence will often injure the owner of the firearm. The study also showed that a firearm is far more likely to be stolen than to be used for self defence (McLaughlin)."
"Thats why we the most shootings in gun free zones. People are going to kill if they want to kill. Having gun controls not gonna stop someone from killing people. If we look at 9/11 there was about 3,000 people killed and we never had talk about banning air planes. There has been a few cases where people took a car and run over people and killed them, and its easier to get a car then a gun."
"Therefore this argument is clearly invalid. There are many other \u201csafer\u201d weapons that can act as a replacement for firearms. Tasers for example have proven to provide just as much protection as firearms with little to no deaths as a result. There will always be an alternative to firearms those who believe differently usually tend to use firearms for recreational use rather than for self defense. Many phones and tablet have fingerprint technology that only allows access to the owner of the cell phone. Recently pro gun control activists have been fighting for more security options on firearms. For example a simple passcode to arm the weapon or even enabling fingerprint technology to ensure only the owner of the weapon can fire it. Recently President Obama has been promoting smart gun technology. Smart gun technology uses methods such as fingerprint and even phone compatibility to recognize the owner of the weapon (Mearian). Smart guns are the future of gun control in America. It is possible that in less than a decade all firearms will have smart gun technology enabled. Gun control will continue to be the topic of many debates unless our government takes responsibility for the thousands of lives taken every year from these deadly weapons. Whether it is school shootings, mass murders, or a simple gunshot, American society is becoming more tolerant of gun homicides. As a country, we need to take control of this problem. As long as firearms are as accessible as they are today America will never be truly safe."
"The laws regarding gun control should be tightened and new laws should be implemented for the safety of our citizens and the image of our country. Recent events relating to mass shootings and terrorist attacks have brought this issue to the table, and there chance of it losing importance is nearly unforeseeable. A fraction of Americans may not understand why this topic is rising in importance. However, the prevalence of debate over gun control was brought to the public\u2019s attention dating back to the 1920\u2019s."
"It is becoming very common to hear about mass shootings involving multiple victims in the United States and most recently in Pennsylvania and California. The mass shooting in California comes as a surprise, as most Americans\u2019 hearts still mourn the death of the 11 individuals at the Pittsburgh synagogue, who lost their lives on an early Saturday morning. Arango and Medina (2018) found, \u201cCalifornia may have the toughest gun control laws in the nation, but that still did not prevent the latest mass killing\u2212shooting on Wednesday that left 12 people dead at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks\u201d."
"The possibly to have a gun today is as simple as wanted. Nobody care if the person that go to the store and buy a gun have any mental disorder like psychotic or delusional, in which one the person pulls the trigger without real consciousness of what she or he is doing."
"If students and staff showed up with guns on college campus, there would be more of a chance of gun violence than if there was not a presence of a gun at all. Students could feel pressured to go out and get a gun just so that they could protect themselves. Guns are not used for only protecting but they are used in other ways as well such as using them in harmful ways. According to Students for Gun-Free Schools (SGFS) there is a study in 2000 by Harvard that states, \u201cGuns are used to threaten and intimidate far more than they are used in self-defense\u201d (639). SGFS is pointing out that the use of guns is used to threaten or intimidate other people more than to use them for defending yourself, which means that students at school would most likely use guns to intimidate and threaten other students which would increase the likelihood of gun violence. Since having guns would create tension all over school campus it would create problems between students and professors. This could increase dangerous situations for both students and professors if one caused conflict for one another. Concealed carry on college campus would just create chaos at colleges and would be better off without guns since it would decrease gun violence and also not having a gun a necessity to have."
"The map below is from the National Conference of State Legislatures published in 2016 showing the different states that ban concealed weapons on campuses. It also shows which states allows concealed firearms to be carried on campuses and which states leave the decision up to the individual schools. Nineteen states have banned concealed firearms to be carried on campuses, eight states allow concealed weapons on campuses and twenty-four states leave the decision to allow guns on campuses up to the educational institution."
"Gateway drugs have been a huge issue for some time now. However America should also consider even hunting guns and a gateway firearm. Becoming comfortable shooting anything would give a person the false impression that shooting person with a handgun is no different. In any situation, prevention is always the best policy. In order to stop the problem at its roots, the government must also look into regulations for hunting guns. Having harsh consequences for not abiding my hunting gun laws will undeniably decrease the possibilities of citizens taking their chances with handguns. The United States of America is notorious for its history of shocking gun-related crimes."
"\u201d Universities are not allowed to establish any \u201crules, regulations or provisions\u201d that outright prohibit carrying of concealed handguns by license holders, except for in cases (d), (d-1) and (e). Any regulations or provisions must be reported to the \u201cstanding committee\u201d every even-numbered year for evaluation, stating the reasoning for not allowing concealed carry.[2]"
"In Parkland, Florida there was a school shooting that had occurred in 2018. 17 people had lost their lives because of the incompetence of the police not listening to warning signs from civilians. \u201cIn the case of the Parkland shooting suspect, the police received at least 45 calls about him, and a woman close to him even communicated to the F."
"There has been a lot of mass shootings in the past few years but is gun control really the answer to end all this? There has been a lot of talk about there being more strict gun control laws, but this is not the way to help end mass shooting. Guns actually save more lives each year then they do kill, according to the CDC. Guns save about 500,000-3,000,000 people each year. Compared to about 13,000 deaths excluding suicidals. Many states with the highest crime rate have the most strict gun laws."
"When the founding fathers sat down to discuss and draft the US Constitution they could not predict the military grade weapons we have today. A Rolling Stone article effectively explains why the Second Amendment does not reflect modern day weapons by stating, \u201cWhen the Second Amendment was written, the Founders didn\u2019t have to weigh the risks of one man killing 49 and injuring 53 all by himself.\u201d (Cohen) In other words the writings of the Second Amendment did not account for our current times so they shouldn\u2019t apply to them either. In 1791 when the 2nd Amendment was ratified the commonly used firearms were muskets and flintlock pistols. Muskets could fire at its fastest once every 15 seconds, modern day weapons like the AR-15 can fire 10 rounds per second. Because the US Constitution and the Second Amendment were written such a long time ago when conditions, technology, and language were different the government is allowed to interpret what was written in order to apply it to our society. When the Second Amendment was written it\u2019s intent was more to give men in militias rights to guns, because the United States had just won independence from Britain and thought it was important to give U.S citizens the security of being able to overthrow an unfair government by giving them the right to own weapons capable of rebellion. The Second Amendment was interpreted by the United States Government to giving all U.S citizens the right to bear arms. Times have changed and military grade weapons are now in the hands of normal everyday citizens and the 2nd Amendment that is giving people rights to own these guns is outdated and does not account for this kind of weaponry and therefore needs to be repealed to account for the destruction of modern day weapons."
"For this reason, the outlook for the political and regulatory environment in which Gunns is operating in is neutral with a leaning towards a more likely, but not certain, positive outcome. Correctly managing relations with all regulatory and political bodies is of the utmost importance for Gunns heading into the future."
"Across all suicide attempts not involving a firearm, less than 5 percent will result in death. But for gun suicides, those statistics are flipped: approximately 85 percent of gun suicide attempts end in death\u201d (Gun Violence in America pg 1). \u201cCWLA\u2019s National Blueprint points out that children and youth exposed to chronic trauma can experience inhibited brain development, producing a lasting impact on life outcomes\u201d(The Impact of Gun Violence on Children, Families, Communities pg 1). \u201cTragically, more than 35,000 people, including nearly 3,000 children, die from gun violence each year in the United States\u201d(Gun Violence Threatens the Health of Our Nation pg 1). \u201cAccording to a 2013 Kaiser Family Foundation health tracking poll, African Americans are far more likely to know a victim of gun violence or be personally worried about gun violence than white respondents. The poll found 42 percent of African Americans personally knew someone who has been the victim of gun violence, compared to only 15 percent of white respondents."
"This means that someone got drunk and chose to get behind the wheel of a vehicle, and killed themselves or others, 10,322 times. However, advocates of controlling drunk driving haven\u2019t suggested taking away vehicles. It is unethical, just like it is unethical to take away guns from people. It took someone to get behind the wheel of that car and drive it while intoxicated, just like it takes someone to pull a trigger. A gun, like a car, is an inanimate object, and only dangerous when put in the hands of someone irresponsible."
"This legislation, and others like it, are intended to prevent or stop public shootings: the old, \u201cgood guys with guns stop bad guys with guns\u201d reasoning.[3] While the idea of \u201cthrowing more guns at the gun violence problem\u201d seems preposterous, proponents believe those intending to carry out a mass shooting may be intimidated by the prospect of not knowing who is carrying[4] and that \u201cgun-free\u201d zones don\u2019t work.[5] Critics argue that background checks are not stringent enough to weed out the \u201cbad apples,\u201d[6] and ultimately, more guns equate to more homicide and violence.[7]"
"As the advantage, with the armed and well-trained teachers, they can protect their students safely if there is an emergency. Moreover, with its disadvantage, it will be dangerous for the students if the armed teachers have some mental problem and he may shoot the students when there\u2019s a conflict. However, there\u2019s still more disadvantages than advantages about it."
"This law should be repealed. The facts simply don\u2019t corroborate its supposed necessity. Even the demographic data shows that an estimated 1% of students attending UT possess LTCs, and an estimated 500 students over the age of 21 live on campus dormitories at that university.[1] I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t all have LTCs."
"Something many people do not understand is that the Second Amendment does not account for the firearm rights of the military so if it were to be repealed it would not take away the military\u2019s right to own firearms, which is a common concern of people with the idea of repealing the Second Amendment or gun control in general. A writer for the website Bearing Arms, Bob Owens, answered questions proposed by Massachusetts Representative Paul Heroux, and during his response explained why the Military\u2019s right to bear arms is unaffected by the repeal of the Second Amendment. Owens stated, \u201cAgain, the right to keep and bear arms of military utility is not dependent on any part of the Constitution or its Amendments.\u201d (Owens) Bob Owens\u2019 point is that there is no legal document that can take away the military\u2019s right to use guns and that their firearm rights are unspoken but valid. A common doubt when such a severe solution is proposed, like repealing the Second Amendment, is that it would take away the right to bear arms from the military but this is untrue as the Second Amendment does not account for the military. Meaning the Military, who actually has a valid reasoning behind their gun rights, which is defending the country, will be able to keep their rights to bear arms even with the repeal of the Second Amendment."
"The solution to America\u2019s gun problem is background checks and restricting gun sales. Removing guns out of their home or passing a prevention gun bill could save lives. Here\u2019s how the solution works. In order to purchase a gun from a federal firearms licensed dealer (FFL), a consumer must provide identification and pass a federal background check using the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2019 4473 form. Fill out the form. The first page of the document requires basic information, including the buyer\u2019s full name, address, sex, birthday, and ethnicity. A social security number is encouraged, but not required. The form also asks the buyer about criminal background, immigration status and mental health information that could result in a consumer being denied. Give the form back to the person who gave you the forms. The person can contact or tell you if you are denied or not."
"In order to achieve gun control and decrease the number of senseless deaths, it is necessary to implement stricter gun laws. The government must create a law to require individuals desiring to obtain a gun be trained to handle a firearm safely. The number of mass shootings in the United States appears to be climbing yearly and no one seems to bat an eye. There have been mass shootings in communities, concerts, bars and even schools, which are all places we think of as safe. We as Americans should not feel like prisoners in plain sight, always looking over our shoulders in fear of death by a gun. Immediately after mass shootings, the news prints a story about a mentally ill or criminally convicted person who should not have obtained a gun."
"Bottom line, individuals with malicious intent will try and succeed by any means necessary. Taking guns away from the American people will just force criminals to either purchase firearms illegally, or turn to other means of devastation; knives, bombs, vehicular attacks, there are some pretty innovative people in the world, I would hate to see what new ways of mass destruction they could come up with if the government involvement with gun control reaches its peak. Doleac, J. writes an article titled \u201cGun regulation is costly, and not the only option.\u201d She goes on to purpose summer jobs for teens reduce mortality by 18 to 20 percent, and Cognitive behavioral therapy for at-risk young men would lower violent crime arrests by up to 50 percent. Maybe going after the source itself, the hand behind the trigger, would help to lower crime rates entirely if more time and energy were spent on investing in our citizens mental health at a young age, identifying and putting out the fire behind the eyes of these sick individuals who use guns on innocent Americans to get their voices herd or to even quiet the voices in their heads. When guns are owned legally, Kate Masters writes that the primary motivation for gun ownership among Americans is for self -defense; fear of other people. A survey of U.S. gun ownership done by Harvard and Northeastern reveals that with the rise in the national violent crime rate, the weapon of choice that is purchased is a handgun, not an AR-15, the semi-automatic weapon the government is using to showcase the necessity of gun control, ultimately leading to the second attempt of repealing the 2nd amendment. I can say as a law-abiding citizen who chooses to embrace my right to bare arms, if I were in one of the horrifying scenarios of a mass shooting, I would try and save as many lives as I possibly could. I will leave you with the question of how many lives could I save if I jumped in front of bullets ripping through the air towards school children? And how many lives could I potentially save if I were to use my legally purchased firearm to disarm and neutralize any threat to my fellow American people?"
"Opponents of the law believe that allowing students to carry guns on campus wouldn\u2019t make campuses safer and, instead, it will lead to an increase in the number of suicides on campuses. Allowing guns in classrooms or on campuses will only increase risk as gun is not essential component for learning."
"The Supreme Court ruling, which reaffirmed the second amendment, protects gun ownership rights regardless of their membership to the state militia (La Valle 1). Previous court rulings do not prohibit gun control laws but easily challenge their constitutionality. Many legal systems recognize self-defense as a right, but permit citizens to use handguns for purposes prescribed by law. The case has only opened up floodgates of litigations in state and lower federal courts with more litigations certain until the parameters become clearer (La Valle 1). Legislators evade discussions about gun control, especially where Bill Clinton strong-armed leaders into voting for the laws that cost most legislators their jobs. Democrats are aware of the move from making gun control a major plank in their domestic policy."
"This is why other fatal objects such as lethal drugs and destructive weapons such as bombs have been strictly illegalized; if they aren\u2019t in the possession of a person, they can\u2019t be used by that person to kill. (Will add more here in final draft!) Firearms should have tighter laws regarding who can obtain them and how easy it is to do so, as well as what kinds of firearms will be legal for an average citizen to have. Guns should not be made completely illegal, because that will result in only criminals obtaining them. However, background checks should absolutely be required to purchase a gun or it\u2019s ammo/counterparts. Firearms that are semi-automatic, not used for hunting, etc., should not be permitted to be in circulation of the general public or sold to them by gun shops."
"As the final 3rd supporting evidence of the 2nd claim, I have found that criminals will continue to find different ways to obtain firearms, all while adapting to avoid detection by agencies like the F.B.I and A.T.F. According to Ryan Cleckner, a former special operations sniper, \u201c36% of Americans exercise their 2nd amendment and own guns\u201d (\u201cWhy More Gun Laws\u201d). This research proves that gun laws are ineffective because it shows how gun ownership and gun related crimes has not just increased slowly over the decade, but have sped up due to recent events in the last five years. Even though some politicians may say that \u201cThese new laws will stop gun violence once and for all\u201d, This not only violates the 2nd amendment, but it also takes away freedom from normal, law abiding citizens."
"The Supreme Court ruled in favor of McDonald, overruling the prior ruling in the slaughter-house cases, making the second amendment and the rest of the Bill of Rights, under the fourteenth amendment\u2019s Privileges or Immunity Clause, extendable to individuals within states. Thirty-three amici curiae briefs were filed; one was signed by 58 senators and 251 representatives, making this the most congressionally supported verdict of all time. The other 32 were filed by stated on their own."
"The rise in shootings on college campuses has opened a new front on the gun debate. After a student at Virginia Tech opened fire on Monday, April 16, 2007 killing thirty-two students and wounding many others (Beck), many students and families want to regulate gun availability on campuses by having a concealed carry permit. They argue that guns on campuses will make students safer, but because the Campus-Carry Movement is to some extent new, there has not been much evaluation of its impact on gun violence."
"Finally, the armed teachers issue is still having many opposite viewpoint and discussion toward it. However, for the most part, allowing teachers to carry guns is not a good idea. It\u2019s still a concern that American gun violence is not a war, so why is the president wanting to \u2018militarize school\u2019 with armed teachers. To prevent bloodthirsty man, gunshot killing simultaneously. If so, be praiseworthy. But teachers have the duty to teach and apply knowledge to students, not to shoot or kill anyone or any students. Forcing them to undertake both teaching and shooting is not a good idea and it is also hard to accomplish. Teaching quality will be reduced and their protection toward the students cannot go further. Imagine that the teacher that are teaching and keeping an eye on all the uncertainties in the same time, then, how can they focus on teaching the students? After a shooting in a Florida school on February 14, killing 17 students, parents and most Americans denounced the NRA. They argue that the law in the United States do not allow young people under the age of 21 to buy alcohol but rather allows people 18 and older to buy and own guns, which is ridiculous. And the debate that the US government have to raise the age to buy and own a gun from 21 years old or above. Touching the rights, the NRA opposes this claim. If the teacher is armed, where do they put their guns in class? There are two cases:"
"To think of society where these types of mentally unstable people have easy access to firearms to fulfill their shooting fantasies in real life makes me fear for the lives of others, as well as my own. There is a surplus of natural and accidental causes of death; America does not need another. What will the generations to come be like? Times change. So will society and people."
"Firearm ownership in the United States has become a controversial issue. The second amendment guarantees the right to bear arms, but in the light of recent frequent mass shootings this right has been challenged. Americans have the right to own firearms for protection and security of life and property, to provide food for the family and to ensure liberty. American citizens have the right to bear firearms."
"But there it is again, and it\u2019s louder this time. You\u2019re scared, your pulse is racing and you cannot think of what to do. You don\u2019t know whether to call 911 or just lay there and hope whatever it was will go away. But then you realize you have a 9-mm Smith and Wesson handgun in the nightstand. You quietly get it out, take off the trigger lock, and retrieve the bullets from on top of your dresser."
"One of the writers who wrote about the gun violence is Thomas Gaber with his best known work named \u201c America\u2019s Gun Violence Problem\u201d. He describes how American faced with many witness mass shooting in the past few years. He assert, \u201c Over the last few years, our country has witnessed mass shootings in schools and on college campuses, in workplaces, movie theaters, places of worship, nightclubs, and shopping malls\u201d. He also strongly support on the way to reform the guns laws(pp.1). Thomas believes because the number of ownership still increase so it is easy to understand that there will be many serious incidents will occurs are undeniable. American take over the world in privately guns ownership and the number estimated is 31% while American population just accounting for less than 5% of the world (pp.11). The number of home succide by guns in American is dramatic, the number of murdered my firearms is at least three times in other country(pp.14). Thomas claims, \u201cHigher gun availability in the USA is likely an important factor in the choice of guns over other means of killing. The cost of having many availably guns in America is to expensive so each of the citizens should take a action now for our better America."
"Praise and worship at your local church or synagogue, singing out loud at your favorite concert, dancing like no one is watching at a night club or simply attending school like most adolescents in this country. How about getting some fast food dinner at McDonalds after an exhausting day at work? All of these public places are scenes for horrendous acts of violence involving guns; mass shootings. Does the pen write the poem? Or is it the poet that uses the pen to express his or her words on paper? An enlightening list of \u201cThe deadliest mass shootings in modern US history\u201d can be found on a link from CNN (2018)."
"What would this mean for criminals and non-law abiding Americans? Time and time again, it is repeat felons and criminals that seem to thrive where others obey and succumb to laws and regulations. Roughly 97.8% of mass shootings continue to occur in gun-free zones\u201d (Crime Prevention Research Center,2018). This is great foresight into what our future would look like if it became criminal for American citizens to possess firearms. Kurtzleben, D. writes that \u201cChicago, being one of the cities where you can find the strictest of gun laws, had a staggering over 4,000 victims of gun related crimes last year alone.\u201d (Kurtzleben ,2017,para.3).She goes on to describe that state lines don\u2019t stop guns, and that bordering states with less strict gun laws like Wisconsin and Indiana, keep criminals well stocked with guns. The staggering comparison between Chicago\u2019s population of 2.716 million people had a gun homicide rate for 2016 of 25.1% per 100,000 residents, while New York\u2019s population of 8.623 million had only 2.3%. We can use this information as insight as to when non law abiding citizens want what they want, they will achieve it by any means necessary. Let\u2019s not even mention black market sales that would not cease to exist with or without government involvement of gun control."
"After the incident Oregon Community College, there were 994 shootings in President Barack Obama\u2019s second term (1004 days), almost every day in a public shooting. The numbers make people wonder why makes the founders believed that the right to private weapons is human rights, maybe it could be an interesting feature of the United States compared to most of the rest of the world. Especially with the gun issues in school, where suppose to be a safe place for students. There are a lot of disadvantages and advantages to gun rights as w ell as many opposite viewpoints toward this issue."
"But gun-rights supporters express outrage at the idea that guns are a problem in the first place. In the words of a popular slogan: \u201cGUNS DON\u2019T KILL PEOPLE-PEOPLE DO.\u201d Which is why the gun-rights movement is so insistent on tougher law enforcement. Put the bad guys in jail, the argument goes, and the rest of us can go about our business and yes, we\u2019ll keep our guns, thank you, since some of the bad guys are still on the loose."
"For example, society has been raising the bar for expectations of students, and it shows no signs of stopping. Is it possible that even elementary students will be stressed under the ubiquitous weight of \u201ccollege?\u201d Despite what they like to believe, parents, who may be responsible with their own guns, cannot always have complete control over teenagers with raging hormones. Due to their hormones, teenagers are naturally impulsive and a gun is an \u201ceasy way out.\u201d This is not only an issue in America, but all over the world as suicide rates of high schoolers have been steadily increasing. Even if a gun is never intended to be used, it still poses a possible danger. By having stricter gun policies, America would be not only be creating a safer environment for the public, but also show the world one solution to lessen the issue of teen suicide."
"Though regulation generally carries with it a negative tone, caused by free-market economic thinking that aims to keep government intervention to a minimum, the regulatory stance imposed by the Tasmanian government on Gunns is not entirely negative. According to the Department of Fisheries, Forestry and Agriculture (2011), the forestry industry accounts for 1% of total GDP, a substantial amount. As such, it can be seen that the relationship between Gunns and the state and federal governments is one of interdependence \u2013 each relies on the other (Piggott 2011). Mutually beneficial regulations and policies, thus, are a desirable occurrence."
"Currently in the United States there are 393 million registered guns, that\u2019s a ratio of 120.5 guns to every 100 people which is why the rate of deaths due to firearms is so high. There are many scenarios with guns that lead to deaths and injuries, some common ones include mass shootings, suicides, and children finding a gun in their home. In 2015 alone there were 2,824 child\u2019s deaths and 13,723 injuries from children finding a loaded gun in their household. Though these deaths and injuries are often unintentional, there are many intentional killings at the hands of a gunman."
"The investigation of gun violence has piqued my interest a little bit. I have seen gun violence be constantly talked about on the news especially now will all these recent shootings. It\u2019s a topic that needs to be talked about but there is no good solution that people can see eye-to-eye on. Aside from that this semester has not really helped me identify areas for further improvement because I already know what I need to focus and improve on which is maintaining my current GPA."
"On June 1, 2015, Governor Greg Abbott signed S.B. 11 into law. The law makes it legal to carry a concealed handgun on college campuses and dormitories and describes the conditions in which citizens can do so. The law took effect on August 1, 2016 for four-year universities and extended to community colleges a year later. The law does not allow open carry, and carriers are required to have an LTC (license to carry). Professors and lecturers are not allowed to ban handguns in their classrooms, but university policy may ban them in their offices."
"It\u2019s late at night, and you\u2019re home all alone. You double checked to make sure all of the doors were locked and made sure all of the windows were closed. It\u2019s been a quiet night, but for some odd reason you cannot sleep. During your restless night, you hear a bump in the kitchen. At first you dismiss it as the wind."
"Professors and administrators should not be allowed to carry a gun on campuses because they are not trained for how to respond to active shooting situations. \u201cA concealed carry class is a permitting class, not a training class. A concealed carry class gives you as much training for the realities of carrying a concealed weapon as your"
"The 2nd Amendment should be repealed because of the developments in firearm technology, we need a solution that takes away gun rights from all United States citizens, amendments can and have been repealed, firearms threaten the liberty of United States citizens, and the 2nd Amendment does not apply to the United States Military."
"We can look to other states that have legalized campus carry for more insight. The John-Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research concluded that most research is at odds with the claims that allowing civilians to bring guns onto campuses makes them safer. They point out that in states with the laxest standards for gun ownership, 60% of incarcerated offenders of gun crimes were legal gun owners. They also found that \u201c1) right-to-carry laws do not decrease mass shootings or the average number of people shot in those incidents; 2) the overwhelming majority of fatal mass shootings occur in places where guns are allowed; and 3) when rampage shootings do occur, very rarely are they stopped by gun-wielding civilians.\u201d They also point to the trend that mass shootings are increasing in frequency in the same time frame that restrictions are being lifted on public carry. They further point out that public carry on campuses is especially problematic as the student body makes up most of the population. College-age people tend to take more risks, abuse more alcohol, attempt suicide more often and are more likely to engage in violent behavior."
"The Supreme Court has upheld existing gun laws as constitutional with the effect being little change ever since the rulings. For many advocates of gun control policies, the focus remains on the patchwork of gun policies made in courts and states. These advocates neglect opportunities of convincing lawmakers to take touch votes (Wagner and Machnowski 1). Besides, the solidly pro-gun Republican majority has expressed little interest for conversations on the issue. Additional federal gun control proposals have increased following the trail of massacres in the United States. Many pundits believe the battle over gun control policy cannot be won in Congress but will take place away from the national spotlight through a patchwork of state-level decisions and precedents as well as legal cases throughout the country (Wagner and Machnowski 1)."
"Government regulation of all industries across the Australian economy has increased markedly in the wake of World War II (Carlin 2011). In the forestry industry alone, there are over 20 separate laws drafted in relation to forest practices (IRIS 2011, Gunns Limited 2011b). The political and regulatory environment is extremely important to evaluate and analyse, as it has major effects on the profitability and sustainability of Gunns."
"The gun control laws are a very controversial topic. To solve this issue there is no right or wrong answer. Not everyone will ever be happy with the rules and regulations of this country. Honestly, I am indifferent. First, I don\u2019t care and second I think it\u2019s too late. Guns have become and shaped our culture as Americans. There are too many loopholes and ways to get around things. Although it\u2019d be incredibly hard, there are things I would about the gun laws if I had the authority."
"There should be uniformity in these laws where similar conditions for gun possession should be indicated in all states. This will prevent cases where certain people are observed to move from their home states to other states where they qualify to own a gun. This will greatly help to reduce the number of crimes that are associated with immigrants who come in with guns from their countries. There is need to revise the current gun control and the associated regulations especially in the recent times when terrorism is on the rise. It is a fact that terrorists are taking advantage of areas where gun control laws are loose to purchase fire arms which they later use in other areas to kill innocent citizens. They end up using illegal means to have the guns transported to their target countries where they train their soldiers who have since proved to be a great danger in most parts of the world. They end up establishing ties with some people living in states which allow purchase of guns under certain conditions to purchase as many firearms as possible. This is a great threat to the efforts which are being made and the interventions included in the fight against terrorism in the world. Unless the current gun control laws and regulations are revised, terrorism will continue to threaten most parts of the world."
"Additionally, reporting rules already exist in the treatment process of a mentally ill individual, however, the option to report a patient as potentially dangerous is based on the specialist\u2019s discretion. Having the option whether to report a patient to the state or not to essentially broadens a therapist\u2019s method of treatment without loosening the sense confidentiality between them and their patient. In the end, enacting laws that makes it mandatory vs. permissive to report a patient create more hurdles between those in need of treatment and seeking help for mental illness."
"Perhaps most drastically, some have proposed or ordered laws expecting subjects to keep weapons in their homes. (Blocher, 2012) Traditionally, there has always been pressure for gun controls which was spawned by two situations: first, an enormous growth in the level of violent crime and, second, the assassinations of presidents and other politically prominent individuals (Singh, 2000). Many agree with the idea of eliminating mass murders, however, the question at hand still is, what laws can be created to decrease the mass shootings (Lewis, 2018)."
"How does one pick someone out of a crowd that looks like they are carrying a gun? I don\u2019t think it is possible to look at someone and tell if they are carrying a gun or not. That is ridiculous. Just because of the way someone looks doesn\u2019t mean that they are carrying a gun. What criteria should be used to determine if someone looks like when they are carrying a gun? Do they put on baggy pants with a do-rag before they put the gun in their pants or pocket? As of right now, there is not one, and never will be one."
"As a result, an ongoing nationwide debate over the best method of preventing gun violence has arisen from the blood of innocent victims whose lives have been taken by firearms. Out of the plethora of methods suggested to control the amount of casualties caused by guns, 2 of the most prominent include tighter gun control policies and treating mental illness. Contemporary society requires that as a population citizens understand the cause of gun violence across the nation and in effect adopt a social or legislative policy whether that is in the form of gun control or recognizing early signs of violence and being proactive about mental health issues."
"Guns do not kill people, people are killed by guns when they fall into the wrong hands. Guns do fall into the wrong hands and that is where they get their bad reputation. But, what happens when you put a vehicle into the wrong hands, say the hands of a drunk driver? According to MADD (Mothers against Drunk Driving) statistics, in 2012, 10,322 people were killed and approximately 345,000 were injured due to drunk driving (MADD, 2013)."
"The Governor can either sign your bill, refuse to sign it, or veto it. If the Governor doesn\u2019t sign your bill within a certain timeframe it automatically becomes a law. If the Governor vetoes the bill, it can still become law if both the House and Senate vote to override the veto requiring 2/3rds vote. For example, \u201cResearch published in JAMA Internal Medicine in early March found that strong firearms laws in a state, such as background checks for all private sales and restrictions on multiple purchases, were associated with lower rates of gun homicides\u201d(Gun Violence in the U.S. pg 1). \u201cReduce firearm access to youth and individuals who are at risk of harming themselves or others. This includes keeping guns out of the hands of those who have been violent toward their partners and families, and those with previous violent convictions, whether through expanding lethality assessment and background checks or supporting domestic violence bills, and gun violence restraining orders\u201d(Gun Violence Must Stop. Here\u2019s What We Can Do to Prevent More Deaths pg 1). Some people might think that bavkground chechks and bills won\u2019t work because nearly 80% of crime guns are already outside of retail distribution channels and outside of transactions made by the law abiding folks who would participate in universal background checks at gun shows .7%."
"Last year in California, Governor Jerry Brown signed into a law, which made it a third-degree misdemeanor to knowingly store a loaded firearm in a place where an unsupervised child could likely access it, regardless of whether or not the child actually does (Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, 2013). This bill is one of several that the governor passed to make sure guns are kept away from children. It is laws like this that should be passed to not remove weapons from civilians, but keep them out of the hands of children, and other individuals who are not capable of properly handling a weapon."
"There are many reasons why guns should be banned. Nowadays we live in a fast world full of stress in which one a simple gesture, look or opinion can put end at your life in a second, just for a bad interpretation or a madness people. Gun control is simply not an option. It is a real issue that we have to face and as soon as we do it the better results that we can have."
"Considering the firearm should be only kept within your household, said firearm should not be \u201cbeared\u201d outside of the home, as in public. The topic of self defense has been a go-to for many when defending their right to bear arms outside of their homes. However, based on many statistics, self-defense has rarely been the case for many assaults; even those that have taken place within the home where firearms are intended to be kept. Within the years between 2004 and 2011, 26,618,300 violent crimes were committed. Of this whopping number, only.79% of the victims protected themselves with a firearm or a threat of one. That is less than one percent, which is unbelievably low; it is too low to back the statement, \u201cI need a firearm for self defense. An even larger amount of property crimes occurred (burglary, break-ins, etc.) at 84,495,500 crimes; of these, only .12% made an attempt to protect themselves with the threat or use of a firearm. Gun related deaths would be substantially reduced if gun control was tighter."
"Opponents of this stance cite the second amendment of the US constitution, which recognizes the need for a well-regulated militia in any free state and protects against infringement of the right to keeping and bearing arms. Lose interpretations of the constitutional amendment have led to the conclusion that gun control is not unconstitutional. In contrast, strict interpretations hold that gun control prohibits the exercise of the second amendment right of bearing and keeping arms (Wagner and Machnowski 1)."
"Officer Jesus Villahermosa, is a S.W.A.T. officer in Washington State and is the founder of Crisis Reality Training. Officer Villahermosa has responded first-hand to gun-related violence in schools. In an essay published in the Chronicle of Higher Education, he concluded: \u201cI have been a deputy sheriff for more than 26 years and was the first certified master defensive-tactics instructor for law-enforcement personnel in the state of Washington. In addition, I have been a firearms instructor and for several decades have served on my county sheriff\u2019s SWAT team, where I am now point man on the entry team. Given my extensive experience dealing with violence in the workplace and at schools and colleges, I do not think professors and administrators, let alone students, should carry guns\u2026 Adding a weapon \u2026 into the mix can quickly turn a constructive meeting into one filled with fear and intimidation\u201d (Dickerson). In an article published by \u201cThe Chronicle of Higher Education\u201d about the effect of guns on campuses and the freedom of speech, Jennifer Sinor tells the story of feminists and media critic Anita Sarkeesian who was scheduled to speak at the Utah State University, but after the faculty received threats against the school if Sarkeesian was allowed to speak there would be a school shooting."
"Furthermore, specialists warn of the possibility that laws targeting those suffering from mental illness may inhibit ongoing treatment. Much of the reactionary gun related legislation, such as New York\u2019s SAFE Act, include stipulation that begin requiring mental health professionals to report patients to the state. Though seemingly preventative to gun violence at the hands of those suffering from mental health related issues, policies with this nature can unravel the trust necessary to effective treatment between a patient and their doctor. In fear that being reported to the state and being labeled as potentially dangerous might affect current or future employment, patients may refrain from disclosing feelings of anger, hostility, or resentment. Being unaware of such feelings in a patient ultimately makes it difficult or impossible for medical specialists to treat their patients as necessary."
"This has since created a negative perception about guns to an extent that the mention of the word gun creates a sense of violence and death in the mind of the audiences. Apart from all these negative perceptions about possession of guns in the society, there is sufficient evidence that this control and regulation is not right owing to the fact that guns are not only used to cause death but they have a role in fighting and dealing with criminals."
"Gun control laws have been a hot debate all around the world. Everyday the latest news constantly shows new crimes involving guns and murders that shouldn\u2019t be happening, from school shootings to break-ins. It may be hard to turn your back against a debate that can affect you more than you think it will. Some people tend to forget that most crime can decrease if the people handling the gun didn\u2019t have such horrible intentions, but that can\u2019t always be promised. Citizens that are for gun control want their U.S. rights and the ability to protect their family at home if they\u2019re ever put into a situation. Meanwhile, people that dont want a gun control law want to protect their loved ones by making it harder for criminals to buy them which would lower the amount of guns on the streets. With this in mind, instituting a gun control law has both its positive and negative depending on the situation and the people behind it."
"Because of recent shootings, federal gun control laws have been put in place to control gun violence, but has it worked? In this essay I will discuss the reasons why these gun control laws fail to do what they are intended to do: prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands. Even though social media may portray that gun control is the \u201csuperior solution\u201d to gun violence, it only leads to more conflict between the National Rifle Association and legislature. Gun laws are ineffective because of illegal gun trafficking and the criminal behavior following a gun restriction."
"This is reflected in the approval of the Bell Bay Pulp Mill, which Gunns has identified as the foundation of its future business (Gunns Limited 2010, Gunns Limited 2011a, Gunns Limited 2011b). The benefits to the Tasmanian economy through job creation, value added to GDP, and the collection of tax revenue (estimated at $597m) are high (Gunns Limited 2011a, Gunns Limited 2011b, Gunns Limited 2011c), whilst the benefits of the new mill for Gunns are obvious as a source of revenue and profit. The governmental support for this project is indicative of a stable political environment that welcomes positive business that can aid the wider economy, a positive implication for Gunns."
"US President Donald Trump said on October 1 that the government would need only a few weeks to officially approve the bump stock regulation. Before that on February 22,2108 trump has tweeted on twitter-he claims, \u201cI will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue \u2013 I hope!\u201d."
"Despite the past turbulence experienced within the economic environment, however, all of these issues are not likely to continue into the future, presenting the opportunity for Gunns to capitalise on the strength and stability of the Australian economy and guarantee future success. The GFC has mostly subsided, and world growth figures, especially in the burgeoning Asian region into which Gunns delivers the majority of its exports, have been positive. The potential of China to become a long-term source of revenue for Gunns, and to potentially overtake Japan as the largest customer of Gunns is a very realistic opportunity that Gunns can capitalise on (Gunns Limited 2011a, Plourde 2011)."
"VPC research has found a gun is far more likely to be used in a homicide or suicide than in a justifiable homicide. More guns are stolen each year that are used in self-defense.\u201d Guns can also be accidental, even if the owners are trained. According to the NETguncontrol \u201c, 505 deaths due to accidental or negligent discharge of a firearm\u201d \u201cSuicides are the second-leading cause of injury death, with 41,000 a year and half of that are used by guns.\u201d Gun prevention should be more enforced."
"The decision to attempt to cater more sufficiently to social stakeholders can only reap positive consequences if it is implemented correctly and the sociocultural environment is thus manipulated in a way that Gunns is seen in a more positive light. Gunns commissioned Pox Populous (2011) to conduct a report into the social viability of the planned Bell Bay Pulp Mill that will form the base of the entire Gunns operations. The report found that overall community sentiment was positive based on the opportunities for economic benefits in the form of job creation and value added to the local economy, but there were some concerns that related to custodianship of the environment and greater ethical and social responsibility. In response, Gunns has set up a means of independent monitoring and reporting of social and environmental performance through the multi-stakeholder"
"As I have pointed out, gun control legislation has only a marginal effect. I think that more headway in lowering handgun related crimes could be made through education. This exact point is made by Barry Goldwater: Gun education, in fact, can actually reduce lawlessness in a community, as was demonstrated in an experiment conducted in Highland Park Michigan. City police launched a program to instruct merchants in the use of handguns. The idea was to help them protect themselves and their businesses from robbers, and it was given wide publicity. The store-robbery rate dropped from an average of 1.5 a day to none in four months. (186)"
"Prior to the constitution the right to bear arms was only given to soldiers employed by the government (Lund). For this reason alone the founding fathers felt it was necessary to allow all citizens the right to bear arms. Today very few people who support the right to bear arms would argue that they need their firearm in case of an oppressed government taking over. A society changes over time and the rules of that society must adapt in order to achieve maximum success and happiness."
"Gun violence in Louisiana has spun out of control the last few years, passing other states and taking the lead in highest firearm deaths in the U.S. Louisiana hasn\u2019t had a \u201cgood year\u201d since 2011 with a low of 865 firearm deaths that year, compared to Louisiana\u2019s nearly 4.6 million residents. Louisiana has been in and out of being the state with the highest murder rate since about 2000. Gun violence is a problem all around the world but seems to stick with Louisiana pretty hard."
"Fair and effective gun policies require knowledge of implementation challenges, the affected parties, implementation challenges, and unintended consequences, revision of policies for better affect, costs of legislation to the society and gun owners, and other issues defining the acceptability of these policies. The questions do not supersede individual and second amendment rights even though both should be considered in decision-making (Haynes 1). Gun control attracts heated and passionate debates whenever it comes up. The glimpse of the wide range of opinions on the topic reveals supporting and opposing voices on the subject. Opponents of firearm regulation and advocates for stringent gun controls cite constitutional, criminal, and criminological justifications that rationally support their stances with very little common ground. It is the belief of many researchers that the absence of a common consensus worsens the problem. The taboo and complicated nature of gun control is filled with emotions that prevent solutions to the problem of civilians hurting and killing others with firearms. Nonetheless, the two extremes need to welcome areas of agreement and use them as starting points in drafting sensible approaches for minimizing the dreadful harms that are associated with guns. Overall, rigorous and transparent methods are required alongside a commitment to non-partisan and objective policy analysis."
"First, the teachers are going to carry guns on their body while teaching, and if there is a gun shooting that occurred in the classroom, the teacher promptly shot back, students may be more dangerous. During the \u2018fighting\u2019, in addition to the bullets of the perpetrators, students can get shot by the teacher\u2019s guns because the shooter may hide behind the students to shoot. If this happens, American schools will turn into a battleground, the most tragic scene on the planet."
"If soldiers are the only one with guns then the places where it can be taken should not be an issue. Guns would only be taken to the warfront. Besides that, guns don\u2019t really belong anywhere in everyday life. There is no use for a gun in school, church, the grocery store, or office buildings. Having guns would not make anyone feel any safer besides the holder of the gun. Personally, I would feel uncomfortable if I knew that people were walking around Pick N Save with handguns. There should very few guns allowed for civilians. One of which should only be loaded with glitter and legos. Just kidding, but the guns allowed should be small and not have very high fire power. Anymore than that and people are not intending on using the guns for \u201csafety.\u201d Guns can quickly turn into guns that are for killing. If the guns weren\u2019t as high power then maybe they would only injure people. That would make more sense for safety because then you have time to call the police and they can be arrested. Nowadays, some people are gun crazy and the moment they feel their safety threatened they want to shoot. If the guns that those people had were not as high powered then plenty of innocent lives would be saved. In conclusion, I am indifferent about gun control. I am not informed enough to have a specific stand on this policy. I do think that everyone state and federal should have a say on this law though. States know their specific problems and the government can give a general policy that states can expound on. I just hope that whatever the final decision is is in the best interest of the citizens of the United States."
"The demand for self-defense is on a high rise, especially in the nonmilitary accessible zone like the campus. People need to be taught about protecting themselves from potential harms and also from assaults of any form in the campus. The argument on allowing concealed weapons on campus by college students, professors, and other college employees has not been properly dealt with. We could judge with common sense that allowing concealed weapons on campus will only make the problem worse and not better."
"Taking people\u2019s guns away will not always result in less crime but often result in more crime. When the subject is gun control, people get angry quickly. Each side has its certainties its slogans and its arguments. But is anybody on either side listening to what the other side has to say? Sometimes you have to wonder. Each side is capable of presenting cogent arguments for its position."
"I have never been the victim or the perpetrator of a violent crime or gun related incident. I am a conservative politically and a Constitutionalist. I have read the Second Amendment and I firmly believe the right to self-defense should never be denied. Most importantly, I have tremendous empathy for those that have been the victims (both directly and indirectly) of gun violence. I believe the above-mentioned qualifiers make me uniquely neutral on the subject."
"Gun rights and changes to policies concerning gun control laws have become a major part of newspaper headlines over the last few decades, and now it is time for people to take action. People need to educate themselves before they form an opinion about the topic. Rather than accepting an opinion because it is their political party\u2019s view. Carrying concealed firearms on college and university campuses should not be permitted because it undermines the safety of the students and faculty. Families who are getting ready to send their children to college or those who already have a student in college should educate themselves on state\u2019s laws about guns on campuses. Students and faculty should not be afraid to come to school to learn or teach because of a potential active shooter. The safest policy to limit potential violence is to prohibit students and faculty from keeping firearms on campus and allow trained law enforcement officers to provide campus security."
"For an example, in May 2015, a toddle found a hand gun in a car and shot at least 23 people. That is scary. I would feel a lot safer if we took away all guns. In article two I agree with Clinton with supporting the same-sex marriage. People cannot tell a person who they can or cannot love. If two people are in love, they should get married without any law saying they cannot. I did not vote this year because I do not like the candidates that are running for president."
"Roughly 30,000 people are killed in the U.S. each year by guns\u2014whether by accident, suicide, or homicide\u2014according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(Funk & Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia). In comparison to other developed countries, firearms in the U.S. are very loosely regulated. In many European countries, for example, gun ownership requires a license from the police. In Japan possession of firearms by the general public is forbidden by law. In Canada, where registration of handguns has been required since the 1930s, a federal law requires the registration of all guns, including rifles and shotguns, with mandatory background checks and a mandatory gun safety course for gun owners(Funk & Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia)."
"Mass shootings are associated with states without laws restricting large-capacity magazines. 67 percent of homicide victims were killed using a firearm. Approximately 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides, and accidents. Guns are used around 60% in crime, How many times do people use guns as self-defense? Guns are barely used in self-defense so bans should be approved. According to defensive gun use \u201cA study published in 2013 by the Violence ytPolicy Center, using five years of nationwide statistics (2007-2011) compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation found that defensive gun uses occur an average of 67,740 times per year.\u201d \u201cThe use of guns in self-defense by private citizens is extremely rare."
"Libertarians seek a \u201cworld of liberty, a world in which all individuals are sovereign over their own lives\u201d. Contrasting to Chicago\u2019s strict gun laws prohibiting firearms, in a small town just outside Atlanta Georgia\u2019s city limits, a place named Kennesaw, mandated in 1982 that \u2018every head of household residing in the city limits is required to maintain a firearm.\u201d (Jimenez,2018,para.7) While this is in fact a law in this town, not all home owners do own a gun, and it is not enforced by the police. The law was enacted in 1982 to act as a crime deterrent, and with the violent crime rate below 2%, and a total of one murder in the last six years, id say the crime deterrent was a success. Criminals usually prey on the weak and venerable, but in a town where it is the law to possess a gun, statistics show that the possibility alone of a person with a gun steers criminal acts away. \u201cGovernment force must be limited to the rights of individuals to life, liberty and property.\u201d Libertarian stance on crime and justice, how would one defend these rights against wrong doers if they lost their inherent right to bare arms? They would be at the liberty of the non-law abiding citizen with the illegal gun, if there was success in repealing the 2nd amendment. Not to mention, it being our last line of defense if our government turns against its people with a well-armed militia of their own."
"\u201cThe art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which no account be neglected\u201d(Sun Tzu)\u201d. The earliest known United States shooting to happen on school property was the Pontiac\u2019s Rebellion school massacre on July 26, 1764, where four Lenape American Indian entered the schoolhouse near present-day Greencastle, Pennsylvania, shot and killed school master Enoch Brown, and killed nine or ten children."
"People that debate having a stricter gun control law think about the safety of their friends and family if there was less chances of buying a gun. Even though the citizens that debate this side believe the crime rate would decrease tremendously with stricter laws, it is not guaranteed. If a criminal wants a gun, they will find any way to obtain one, even if its done illegally. Imagine a family peacefully hanging out in the living room watching T.V. together and all of a sudden someone breaks in from the back window. The unfamiliar man holds them all at gunpoint. What do they do? The oldest son hears what\u2019s going on in the room nearby but doesn\u2019t have a gun or weapon to safely save his family without the predator seeing him."
"Another example of the positive relationship between the government and Gunns Limited is the termination of the rights to logging native wood in Tasmania, from which Gunns received a $23m payout. This allowed the government to fulfill its commitment to the wider Tasmanian community who wished for sounder environmental practices throughout Tasmania. However, this decision by the government does reveal a potential risk in the political environment that could adversely affect Gunns in the future \u2013 though Gunns has great bargaining power, the wider community has more sway over the government. The potential for social backlash causing government regulation to negatively affect Gunns is low due to the increased commitment Gunns is showing to wider society as discussed in the next section, but the chance still does exist that a problem could arise."
"We are now nearing 3 years into the policy being put into effect, it is difficult to assess whether the policy has had any beneficial or deleterious effects. Active shooter events on college campuses are a rare event, and gun crime does not appear to have decreased in the areas surrounding campuses.[8] There have been reports of accidental discharge of firearms by LTC carriers in dormitories at Tarleton State University[9] and Texas A&M.[10] No one was injured."
"If police do find guns on a person that looks a certain way, do you stop everyone that looks like that? I do not think so. If they did that, then they would have certain groups getting stopped all of the time. Imagine someone walking down the street with some of their friends and you get stopped four times in two miles of walking? How would that make you feel? It would not make me feel real good. I would be angry at the police because I was not doing anything wrong and I was getting punished for it. One way of preventing this from happening is to do one of Wilson\u2019s solution, perfect a metal detector that police officers could carry around with them."
"I know many people that carry guns that probably would be stopped because of the way they look. They look like your everyday, average American teenager. I doubt very seriously that a police officer, even with rigorous training, could pick someone out of a crowd that was carrying a gun. If police forces employed this tactic, how would they stop the constant harassment to one person?"
"\u201d This does not apply to private institutions, which can \u201c(e) after consulting with students staff, and faculty of the institution, may establish rules, regulations, or other provisions prohibiting license holders from carrying handguns on the campus of the institution, any grounds or building on which an activity sponsored by the institution is being conducted, or a passenger transportation vehicle owned by the institution."
"Whenever a gun is purchased from a place certified to sell weapons, there is a short process. Typically, a person would need a valid driver\u2019s license and a social security number. Based on this information, the store checks with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to see if this person has any restrictions on their record that prevents them from owning a firearm. One example of this would be that, in Louisiana, it is against the law for anyone convicted of certain crimes of violence to possess a firearm for a period of ten years from the date of completion of the sentence, probation, parole or suspension of sentence (NRA-ILA, 2013). If this were the case for someone trying to purchase a firearm, this would be flagged and the store would be required by law to not sell that individual a gun."
"From presidents such as Lincoln to hard working students at Virginia Tech, Guns have proven to have done more harm to ALL Americans. It is imperative that the government start to not only raise the qualifications for obtaining guns, but also further enforce these laws. The government must pay more attention to keeping track of registering all guns for the safety of all citizens, from congressmen and women to the civilians who work hard to make this country a better place."
"In conclusion of this topic, I don\u2019t think this will solve any problems because all in all there is no way to keep the school, parents, or the community happy. Everyone will have something to say then that will be led into another problem as well. Also, students can be put in risk of an injury in the event of an accident made by the teacher. Teachers may get mad a student and use that against them, and they might even threaten them. According to Trevor, who teaches 11th and 12th grade in Georgia says\u2026 \u201cthe idea of arming teachers in nothing short of ludicrous. He thinks this would place them in a position of seeing every student in school as a threat\u201d. Students may fear that now the teacher have power over the class and may flip out when ever she wants too and use her weapon in a way that will scare the class into being better students."
"McDonald\u2019s points seem valid, for one the law restricts handgun ownership in turn the right to own and bear arms. Some places require proof of ownership of firearms before registration, thus making point two impossible. Point tree has only one real flaw I can see there being grounds for arguing and that is the fee, if that wasn\u2019t there it would be fine; but this fee makes it economically infeasible for people to own a gun."
"There have been a number of cases of people who have ended up in jail after they are caught involving themselves in illegal businesses involving sale of guns. Despite the fact that these people are caught and sentenced, there is need to understand they reasons as to why these people found it easy to get started in this kind of business. One important thing to note is that these people are aware of the regulations that surround gun control which makes it hard for a big number of people to own a gun. Those in this illegal business take advantage of this to exploit their qualifications to own a gun and later selling the guns to those that are not qualified. The illegal sale of guns is a great danger to the society in that the government is not aware of who finally ends up owing a gun. This becomes a problem in case of a crime and there is need to establish the ownership of the firearm that was used. Even after the investigations are carried out, it becomes harder to arrest the victim when it turns out that the firearm is registered under names that are not available in the government databases. To avoid all this, gun control should be lifted to allow citizens to own registered guns so that it becomes easy to trace criminals in case of criminal activity that occurs in the society (Gold). When citizens are aware that they firearms are registered, most of them will avoid using or giving out their guns to be used in criminal activities as they know they will finally be arrested. This is a great deal to help minimize the number of criminal activities in the society."
"Ever since the United States fought its way to independence from Britain it\u2019s prided itself on how every United States citizen is free and has liberty. At the time when the U.S Constitution and the Second Amendment were written one of its main goals was to protect this liberty by giving them the right to bear arms so they can rebel against a possible tyranny. Not only is there no longer a huge threat of tyranny today but the current firearm conditions are putting United States\u2019 liberty at stake. One key part of liberty is that a person\u2019s actions and way of life is not oppressed, and because of the immense amount of people carrying guns and mass shootings people are forced to always be careful and aware of the possibility of someone with a firearm attacking them. Firearms have forced a fear where many people cannot go to places like a grocery store without constant worry, and this is not what liberty is defined as. According to the American Psychological Association \u201cNearly one in three adults (32%) feel they cannot go anywhere without worrying about being a victim of a mass shooting, while just about the same number (33%) say fear prevents them from going to certain places or events.\u201d (Bethune and Lewan) This means that many U.S adults struggle with anxiety and worry about getting attacked by a shooter and this fear oppresses and affects their decisions including going places and how to get there. Liberty is supposed to be a state where a person can do whatever they want and a fear of firearms is not liberty, so in order to protect the liberty of the United States we need to take away the very thing that is threatening that and to do that the Second Amendment must be repealed."
"According to the New York Times, the NRA was founded on November 16, 1871, a not-for-profit American gun advocacy organization based in Fairfax, Virginia. The main objective of this organization is to encourage people to use guns on a scientific basis (\u201cWorld Malayalee Council\u201d). Not just a non-profit organization, the NRA is invading the political arena to fight gun control laws in the United States ( The New York Times).In 1934, the NRA established a Legislative Branch composed of many analysts and former politicians to analyze, evaluate and evaluate upcoming bills, after the National Arms Act was adopted in 1934.In the 1970s, the NRA focused primarily on shooter shooters, hunters to undermine the Gun Control Act of 1968. In 1975, the NRA established the NRA Acting Institute for Legislators formed a powerful coalition with politicians to \u2018protect the American gun culture\u201d. The NRA still exists and supports gun ownership and is always looking for ways to counter gun control laws, many mass shootings will occur like the mass shooting Las Vegas (The New York Times)."
"Nevertheless background checks save lives. They are the foundation of any effective effort to reduce gun violence and are associated with lower rates of gun homicides, suicides and gun trafficking in states that require them for all handgun sales. But current federal law only requires licensed gun dealers to conduct background checks on gun sales. Background checks also keeps guns out of the hands of people with dangerous histories and they are the foundation of any comprehensive gun violence prevention strategy. If we don\u2019t act now, then we will die a lot faster. If we act now, then the solutions will be easier to solve."
"Rich Lowry in \u201cIgnorant Crusade-Gun Control Campaigns Stemming from the San Bernardino Shooting Aren\u2019t Based in Fact\u201d describes the irrational mindset of rampant gun control campaigns in America. Through the utilization of a ridiculing tone, Lowry conveys gun control supporters\u2019 lack of knowledge regarding the issue of gun violence in the country. Within the passage, he explains that gun control supporters \u201cknow little about\u201d firearms as a whole and have \u201cno compunction to learn\u201d, about the statistics and fallacies of their stance on the role of legislation regarding guns."
"Mass shootings have been racing across headlines in the news and devastating many families due to the loss of loved ones. Current assault-style rifles, like the all so popular AR-15, are available to all US Citizens through the 2nd Amendment and can fire hundreds of rounds in a minute. These types of firearms have allowed mass shooters to create a devastating amount of casualties. According to the magazine Mother Jones \u201cThe current analysis included a total of 102 mass shooters in the United States between 1982 and 2018 described in media reports.\u201d (Yelderman, Joseph, West, and Butler) Meaning in the 36 years between 1982 and 2018 there were over 100 firearm attacks that resulted in at least 4 deaths. United States citizens right to bear arms has resulted in terrible tragedies and therefore there is a huge need for gun control in the United States so that these deaths of innocent people do not occur at such a high rate, and repealing the Second Amendment is a solution that will prevent these events from happening."
"This case\u2019s ruling furthered that of the District of Columbia v. Heller ruling protecting people in federal areas within states to extended to all parts of the states by overruling the slaughter-house ruling and stating that the Bill of Rights IS encompassed under the fourteenth amendment\u2019s Privilege or Immunity Clause. The ruling established precedent for farther cases calling infractions of the Bill of Rights into question by extending it to all individuals, within a state not just a federal area."
"According to The Editors/ Marie Claire, Feb 23, 2018 the main idea of this subject is that teachers think it\u2019s the worst idea for them to be concealed with weapons. He interviews 30 teachers from all around the world about the idea of carrying guns and here\u2019s what a few of them had to say\u2026 \u201cArming teachers in the classroom as a means of protection is not an appropriate or productive way to prevent future shootings."
"In conclusion, \u201cJust Take Away Their Guns\u201d is mostly an informative essay on public perception of gun control and the minimal affect the government can do to tighten gun laws. Throughout this essay he gives us a cause and effect type summaries of separate fixes proponents of gun control have introduced which includes regulating guns, employing police department interference, and judicial law changes. Although each point has enough merit behind to reasonably consider the author employs enough logical reasoning to sway the reader to his opinion through the use of credible sources and information."
"Mental illness may not be a direct indicator of potential for gun violence; however, when a mentally ill individual obtains a gun this is not an ideal combination. There has been some debate, but most would agree that mentally ill individuals should not be permitted to purchase guns or have access to them. It is understandable that mental illness is such a vague term but when it comes to legally possessing a deadly weapon; an individual who is documented as unstable will prevent death or injury by firearm. Wolf and Rosen (2015) illustrated, \u201cThe problem with tying mental illness to the gun control debate is that people assume those with mental illnesses are more prone to violence than those without these issues\u201d. This quote means that an individual with a mental illness should not automatically be considered violent."
"Up to 42% of Republicans have at least one gun while only 16% of Democrats are armed. While 56% of Republicans think that more armed Americans will reduce crime levels, the opposite is true, only 15% of Democrats have this viewpoint, while 51% think criminals will increase if more Americans have weapons.73% of the Republican think individuals should carry guns while 26% of Democrats agree with it.75 % of Democrats and only 24 % of Republicans consider gun control regulations to be tighter (Baxter Oliphant). Both Republican and Democrat think guns control is a big modern problem in United States. Nearly two-thirds of Democrats agree there would be fewer mass shootings in the U.S. if it were stricter for people to legally obtain guns; only about a one-fourth of Republicans agree with it (Baxter Oliphant)."
"If the state itself, and the people that reside in it would help to push these laws, then maybe one-day gun violence will drop to almost nothing. Gun laws and permits are very lenient in Louisiana when it comes to owning and carrying a gun. In Louisiana, you do not have to a permit or license to purchase a firearm. Under certain circumstances, seven-teen-year-olds are allowed to open carry. A simple background check is done, but as far as a federal background check comes, they are not required."
"The statistics on the ownerships of these guns are mostly unreliable and unavailable, so it is impossible to know how many of these fire arms are legally owned and how many are illegally hold. When a person intents on doing harm and he/she wants to get a gun, they will either have one already, or will be able to easily get one."
"This incident opened my eyes because it showed me that gun violence is portrayed as a rare occasion, but it continues to happen silently every day. Kristof highlights several issues relating to gun violence in his article. Just like Kristof, I believe that regulations on purchasing guns should have more restrictions and should be regarded very seriously because of the threat that it brings when placed in the wrong hands."
"This is important to state because the reader can now understand the minimal effect gun control will provide. This statistic alone makes it difficult to comprehend the positive impact that tighter gun laws will provide. A general gun control is not enough to reach that two percent, because of this we have to side with the author on this point."
"Adding to the problem, allowing concealed carry will distract students and staff from their learning environment and they may not perform as well in class. If students had the right to have a gun, then other students may be on edge since the tension of a gun is in the room. Whether a student uses the gun or not students and staff would be distracted because they still feel unsafe in their environment. In an article found online, David Daniel, deputy chancellor of the University of Texas System says, \u201cOn some campuses, there was a very high level of angst, tension and it was a distraction from the core work of university\u2019s\u2026\u201d (qtd. in Clark). Students should not have to come in to college campus worrying about someone having a gun on the, instead, students should be allowed to walk into college campus knowing that they will be safe and have nothing to worry about. Students may not be able to perform the task at hand at full potential because they are distracted from the fact that there is a gun on college campus. What this means is that even though the gun is not used the thought of the gun will affect the ability to work on an assignment or not. Not only does it increase tension and distractions to students and teachers, but it also doesn\u2019t let students voice their opinion in classrooms without fearing to offend another student or teachers\u2019 point of view. Creating different views on a subject or topic could create fear to students and staff and could potentially also make the learning environment harder to adapt to. Andrew Wilson, a student at the University of Pennsylvania School of Law explains \u201cStudents must grapple with the stress of grades and careers\u2026the potential for offence in legal classrooms is high and adding guns in the mix is dangerous.\u201d (635). This basically implies that if students have bad grades or gets offended in a classroom the chance of someone pulling a gun out is higher than if guns weren\u2019t in the mix. The stress of students creates dangerous thoughts that could lead a student making bad decisions. With adding guns into schools it could create a dangerous environment to students and at the same time not allow students to fully experience their education. The potential of offence in schools could also create dangerous environments for students and professors. Guns on campus could detract from their learning environment and their education could be affected as well."
"For example, According to NRA, \u201cAccording to the National Rifle Association (NRA), guns are used for self-defense 2.5 million times a year (\u201cChris Cox\u2019s NRA Armed Citizen\u201d). The police cannot protect everyone all of the time. 61% of men and 56% of women surveyed by Pew Research said that stricter gun laws would \u2018make it more difficult for people to protect their homes and families\u201d (\u201cWhy Own a Gun? Protection Is Now Top Reason\u201d)."
"In 2005, Congress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which shields gun manufactures and sellers from civil claims brought by victims of gun violence. However, research overwhelming concludes than more guns equal more death. If we put a gun in the wrong hands is just a matter of time that some innocent people can be hurt or what it is worse the result ends in death."
"\u201cGun control entails laws whose aim is to ensure a limitation in firearms possession. Gun control or gun rights are a very public subject. I\u2019m not a weapons expert; I don\u2019t even own a gun. I have fired a few at a couple at ranges, but just for fun. I would not consider myself proficient with any weapon. I don\u2019t hunt. I do love the outdoors and have seen wildlife up close, but I\u2019ve never had the need to shoot an animal for food or sport."
"The leading causes of death in America is guns. African Americans are 2.5 times more likely to be killed by a gunshot. In order to do something about the gun shootings, volunteer to protest, or donate to charity for the victims of gun shootings. If you don\u2019t take action, then there will be more consequences and fatality. However, if you do take action, then we will feel a lot safer being outside or/and at home. Guns shootings affect almost everyone and I hope many people make a change to end guns."
"Gun violence has skyrocketed over the past years, which has caused Americans to panic due to the lack of gun control laws. Gun control laws have been a debate for years and still is an ongoing issue today. Having gun control laws which require additional security measures to obtain firearms will result in a decrease of violent crimes. The Supreme Court vetoed the ideal that the Second Amendment\u2019s purpose is to protect the state militias from the deactivation of weapons by the government, it was found that the Amendment allows people the privilege to maintain and remain battle ready detached from military administration, which uplifts above all other interests the right of law-abiding, accountable citizens to use arms in defense of their home (Blocher, 2012)."
"This left precedent for McDonald v. Chicago. A major reason this case is in fact such a landmark is not its conclusion to the question left open by the case of District of Columbia v. Heller, but its potential to overturn the slaughter-house cases\u2019 ruling which ruled that the fourteenth amendment\u2019s Privileges or Immunities Clause did not include the second amendment or the Bill of Rights in general. If this case does indeed overturn the slaughter-house rulings then this will leave a window for any other possible change to laws based on infractions of the Bill of Rights, this makes this case a seat sitter for those for McDonald, against him and others with their own agendas waiting for the right opportunity."
"This case calls the second amendment and well in a way the fourteenth amendment as well. McDonald feels Chicago\u2019s gun laws restricted and diminish his and others rights to own and bear arms as given by the second amendment. The fourteenth amendment is also being called into question for McDonald feels the second Amendment should be encompassed by the fourteenth amendment\u2019s Privileges or Immunity Clause."
"If concealed carry was legalized some students and staff would go out of their way just to get a gun so that they could protect themselves too because if they didn\u2019t have anything to protect themselves with their lives would already be in danger to defend themselves. According to \u201cCasebook\u201d there is a study that states, \u201cSince 1990, there have been more than twenty multiple-victim shooting incidents on college campus\u201d (633). What they are trying to explain is that the number of shootings on college campus are already at an all-time high and the increase of gun availability could increase the number of shootings even more."
"We have seen it a lot where shooters will post things online indicating their harmful intentions before they go out and do it so having a red flag law would helpful in reducing gun violence and possibly even a mass shooting. Gun violence is not only just about mass shootings, it\u2019s about regular shootings as well and people tend to forget that. All of us know a part of town that we probably should not go to since the crime rate is high and that it gets a bad reputation. In areas that have a significantly high crime rate involving guns such as Detroit or Florida we need to figure out why gun violence is so high in these areas so that we can take small steps in reducing it. We could possibly have more policing in these areas or maybe tackling on the problems that are in such areas in order to help the people."
"While exploring the connections between mental health issues in the community and mass shootings, experts often reference gun laws. In contrast to the argument for more restrictive gun policies, the case for tackling gun violence through promoting mental health claims that gun sale legislation can be ineffective and even counterproductive. A quintessential gun policy passed after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act of 2013 (\u201cSAFE Act\u201d) aimed to promote public safety by preventing criminals and the \u201cdangerous and mentally ill\u201d from accessing weapons through universal background checks. Without dismissing the fact that people with mental illness can be potentially dangerous, it is important to note that legislation that targets the mentally ill specifically does little to help those in need and inadvertently promotes the common misconception that people with mental health issues are violent, therefore increasing stigma, an already tremendous obstacle stopping many in need from seeking professional mental health treatment."
"It would also limit the types of guns you are able to purchase and those you are not. (semi-automatic guns, automatic guns, warfare guns, etc) and it would decrease the amount of stolen weapons that are used in crimes. If the weapon is stolen, it is a lot more difficult for the police to track the gun back to the person who used it. \u201cAccording to the United States (U.S.) Department of Justice (DOJ), about 1.4 million guns have been reported stolen during burglaries and property intrusion crimes from 2005 through 2010..\u201d(\u201cPros & Cons: Gun Control \u2013 The Pros & Cons\u201d) With this being said, 1.4 million guns will be hard to be tracked down if there\u2019s ever a case where they\u2019re being used for a crime of some sort."
"Pass laws that really have an effect: Not all of the gun laws are being equally created. The military rifles that are used almost al (mass) shootings may dominate the debate, but they apply for less than 5% of all deaths. Research in 2018, also found that strict fire arm laws in states, such as the background checks for all (private) sales and restrictions on numerous purchases, were identified with lower rates of gun deaths."
"The more guns American citizens put into this country the more people we take out in gun related deaths. The study also proves that the correlation between gun accessibility and homicide does not relate to non gun related homicides. Proving that the homicides were only committed because of the accessibility to guns not because of the people living in the area. The Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting, Columbine shooting, and Virginia Tech shooting where all a result of easy accessibility to weapons in one\u2019s household. The two seventeen year old shooters in the Columbine High school shooting acquired two 12-gauge shotguns and two 9mm firearms through their friends for a total of $500. The shooter of the Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting stole his weapon, a .22 caliber savage MK 11-F bolt action rifle, from his mother (Wilson). In every gun related homicide the attacker had easy access to a firearm. These deaths can easily be prevented by simply cutting down on firearm accessibility. On the other hand, those against gun control argue that the number of firearms in America is so large that applying gun control laws will only make matters worse. Currently there are approximately 270-310 million guns across American households (Wilson)."
"Furthermore, it is likely that the Australian dollar will depreciate for two reasons. Firstly, an expected interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia on the 1st of November 2011 will result in decreased demand for the Australian dollar due to decreased levels of return on foreign investment into Australia. Also, the planned imposition of the carbon tax will hurt the competitiveness of the mining companies whose business is currently propping up the inflated Australian dollar (Maher 2011). As a result, there will be a decreased Chinese demand for Australian exports, also decreasing the value of the Australian dollar. This depreciation will enhance the competitive position of Gunns, allowing greater profit margins and increased revenue from exports."
"Another idea, by Yuval Rosenburg/ The Fiscal Times, February 22, 2018 is will arming teachers in America as Donald Trump have proposed cost a lot. According to this source the answer is yes. That means is there was a law that was passed to allow teachers to carry guns. It will be roughly 718,000 teachers\u2019 nationwide that will have to be trained. In Yuval Rosenburg article \u201cproviding basic firearm training for teachers would cost about 71.8 million dollars. More robust training created for teachers in active shooter scenarios might run about 1,000 dollars per trainee, or 718 million totals\u201d. Therefore, getting teachers trained will cost more than expected. Not only to mention after training them you must buy guns as well. That\u2019s other expenses they would have to investigate as well. According to Yuval Rosenburg article \u201cbuying hundreds of thousands of Glock G17 pistols would add about 360 million to the line\u201d. That if the government doesn\u2019t get a discount for it. Then the total cost would go up to about 250 million, which includes the training and the guns. But if schools\u2019 systems choose not to get the basic training and just purchase the guns, that would bring the cost down to about 180 million according to Yuval\u2019s article."
"Statics shows that when \u201cgun control\u201d was tried in places like Chicago and Washington D.C., it had absolutely no effect on bringing down crime and murder rates. From 2013 to 2016, the child murder rate for the entire United States increased by a whole thirty-percent. Data also shows that firearm homicides among the other children were most likely persuaded by other crimes. In 2010, Louisiana had the worst murder by firearm rate in the nation. That\u2019s almost ten people dead for every hundred thousand people. That\u2019s more than two and a half times higher than the average. From 2001 to 2010, Louisiana held the record for more gun deaths per capita than any other state. It is found that a firearm takes the life of a Louisiana resident every ten hours. Among those people that die every ten hours, four of them are estimated to be women and children. It is also good to realize that some states that have strong gun laws still have high firearm murder rates. It is found that gun control revolves around limited gun laws depending on the state because low gun violence reflects off of strong gun laws."
"This would stop the unlawful, harassing, demoralizing searches that would happen every day. The police officers could just aim the detector at the individual and tell if they had a big hunk of metal in their pocket. If they detected enough metal on someone, then that gives them reasonable suspicion to stop someone. How can anyone make a stop on reasonable suspicion by the way someone looks? Again, no one has the ability to tell that a gun is present in a group of people. Overall, I believe that Wilson\u2019s essay presents both sides of the issue very well. He argues both sides of the point and provides some solutions to the problem. His solutions, in my opinion, are on the right track, but they have a lot of room for improvement. Something needs to be done about criminals getting guns, but it should not infringe on certain group\u2019s rights just so a few more people carrying guns may be caught."
"This shows that gun control would not be very effective if the government believes it will decrease death rates. Mainly because diseases are more likely to kill a person before a gun will. The article continues by reporting that, \u201cFirearms were the 12th leading cause of deaths for all deaths between 1999 and 2013, responsible for 1.3% of deaths\u2026\u201d (\u201cData & Statistics\u201d). The article explains that firearms are not the main reason why people are dying. Though they are the 12th leading causes of death they are only responsible for 1.3%. 1.3% of 100% is very small causing deaths relating to firearms very low. Finally, gun control should not be implemented because criminals will still find ways around the law."
"If we can focus on these places specifically with high amounts of gun violence and try to help them then it would be a huge step forward and a possible solution in reducing gun violence. Now I want to talk about the negatives in my points in order to find some common ground. Having a red flag law would be great in all but at the end of the day it is still not enough to stop mass shootings. Like for example with the Dayton mass shooting. \u201c\u2026We found no evidence that the subject communicated his violent intentions to others before the attack . . . The subject had no known history of mental health care and treatment . . . The subject left no clear evidence of a plan or manifesto detailing his intent and rationale or revealing any observable pre-attack behaviors\u2026"
"If concealed carry was legalized on college campus then it could create a dangerous and violent environment for students and staff, and we should take legalizing concealed carry on college campus more seriously and realize how much danger we could put our schools into. Students should realize how scary the situation could be if guns were presented to them inside of college campus and could put their lives at risk. The teachers and staff should also see that if concealed carry were involved it could also put their lives in danger at work as well. Since legalizing concealed carry could create so much chaos in schools it would be better to keep them away from schools. If 94% of American citizens already agreed it should not be allowed on college campuses, then why do they believe that it would be better with concealed carry on colleges now."
"The weakened financial performance recorded by Gunns in the past two years has been heavily predicated by the difficult economic conditions in which the business has been operating. The global financial crisis (GFC), coupled with an appreciating Australian dollar and the March Japanese earthquake, have all negatively impacted on the competitive position of Gunns, reflected in the $355.5m loss recorded in the 2011 financial year (Gunns Limited 2011a)."
"Apart from restrictions on machine guns and fully automatic weapons , a database containing a list of individuals prohibited from purchasing firearms, and a law mandating that federally licensed dealers conduct a \u201cBrady background check\u201d to determine if a customer\u2019s name is listed as a prohibited purchaser, there is no national law that fully prevents \u201cbad\u201d people from obtaining firearms. Moreover, because of the ambiguous definitions of who should be prohibited from acquiring firearms and issues regarding states sending records of clearly dangerous people, the background check database remains incomplete. Regardless, if the database were to be updated and contain no error, this would do very little to halt criminals from acquiring weapons because of the number of \u201cprivate sales\u201d that occur across the country. Because of this, experts claim that legislation needs to be passed to create more restrictions over the private sales of firearms."
"Crime happens everyday all around the United States. Have you ever wondered if there was a reliable way to cut down the amount of crime that is done. A lot of citizens say that guns play a big part in the amount of crime that takes place and some argue against them. Before anyone argues that point, they should know some information about the gun control law in the United States and even in their own states. \u201cGun control generally refers to laws or policies that regulate the manufacture, sale, transfer, possession, modification, or use of firearms\u201d(\u201cGun control april 21, 2013\u2033)."
"However, because of the high amount of gun related crimes and gun violence, ranging from mere bullet wounds to tragedies including massacres at the hands of killers armed with guns, groups of people argue that the second amendment is outdated and no longer reflects the circumstances of present day America."
"They do not fear if the rifles they use are tracked and collected by the police because the firearms are not registered under their names. It is through this regulation that some people who are not allowed to own the guns end up killing those with the guns to take the guns away to use them in the criminal activities. If everybody was allowed to own the guns, the number of those killed by criminals for the purpose of obtaining the guns would be low. The different requirements that come with gun laws are inappropriate in that the United States have different gun laws. This does not sound to be good in that people are allowed to own guns differently despite the fact that they live in the US. This is a form of regional segregation where some people who qualify to own a gun in some states do not qualify in other states. This creates a scenario where security details in some states are continuously improving while the same security is deteriorating in other states (Webster & Vernick)."
"By 2015 an estimated 13,286 people were killed by a firearm, this number excludes self inflicted deaths. The problem is that as gun technology and availability has increased United States gun laws and regulations haven\u2019t kept up. A common argument within the opposing side of gun control is that limiting the ownership of guns goes against the 2nd Amendment, but times have changed since the 2nd Amendment was written in 1791 and the reasons behind it no longer apply to the present times."
"If America doesn\u2019t adapt to its changing society, the country will never progress. School shootings, gang violence, and gun related murders all have a direct correlation with the accessibility to firearms in our country. A recent study conducted by the Harvard injury control research center proves that more gun accessibility results in more homicides (Miller). There is no sugar coating it."
"So as we now have seen the arguments of both sides, we can clearly state that the issue of gun-control is big and quite controversial. Most of the US citizens don\u2019t want to give up their guns and their main reason is the second amendment. But this is the thing that makes it hard for the pro side, because of the fact, that it is the right of every citizen to obtain a gun."
"In addition to the social stigma and treatment barriers they may cause, research has shown that background checks would not prevent major acts of gun violence as a large scale of mass murders have shown very little to no criminal past and/or have not been classified as potentially dangerous. For example, in the case of Adam Lanza, the man found guilty of murdering 20 children and 6 adults in Sandy Hook Elementary, was said to not be a risk to himself or others by the professionals who examined him. Moreover, the weapons and ammunition used in the killing spree were legally purchased by his mother.Through cases such as these it becomes apparent that although constricting gun purchases for the \u201cdangerous mentally ill\u201d may decrease accessibility to weapons, the probability of a potential suicide victim or mass shooter being unable to obtain a firearm would be marginally slim."
"In the United States, the topic of gun control and violence is very controversial. In the past, guns have caused several negative repercussions in the general public. The author, Nicholas Kristof, talks about this issue in detail in his article \u201cKristof: Lessons from the Virginia Shooting\u201d. Kristof argues for further protection of guns due to the growing rates of gun violence across the United States. One case that proves this point is the case on Bryce Williams, a famous broadcaster who was found guilty for murdering two of his former co-workers."
"Second, if the teachers do not carry a gun on his body but hide somewhere in the classroom, how do they react when the shooter appears suddenly, he can be one of the students in the classroom? School assaults happen very suddenly and in just a few minutes. It can happen in the classroom, in the library, in the dining room, in the middle of the school grounds, or in front of the school where the objective is the students. When the teachers are able to get the gun to intervene, the shooting may have ended, the students still have been harmed. A well-trained teacher can only shoot after the shooter has done. Thus, despite the shots that teachers shoot, but they could not protect the students, and could not stop the shooting. And so the safety of the school has not improved. Madman, psycho\u2026 when they get mad, they are not afraid of death, guns of teachers can not stop them. So the suggestion that arming and training or teachers to protect students of President Donald Trump is a waste of work, and lack of practical vision, just demagogues. Earlier on March 9, Florida Governor Rick Scott signed a law restricting the possession of firearms and allowing some staff in schools in the state to be armed. The new law allows for an increase in the minimum age allowed to purchase handguns from eighteen to at least twenty-one, prohibiting all homemade self-propelled weapons from being sold automatically and raising funds for mental health care. The new law also includes a clause on the school \u2018self-defense\u2019 program, whereby some employees working in schools will be equipped with guns to intervene and prevent in the emergency event that discharges guns."
"However, for many, these games become a reality and give them ideas. They do not understand that what happens in those games is meant to be only for the game. There are a growing number of cases where teenagers and adults alike have reenacted scenes from games such as Grand Theft Auto."
"This paper is an examination of the ideological divide in gun control debates and the most sensible approach to gun ownership in the United States. The continuing debate on gun control makes it essential to identify policies stemming from the US Federal law, beginning with the second amendment. The Supreme Court has used the constitution in making significant gun-policy decisions in cases such as the District of Columbia v. Heller or McDonald v. Chicago where the second amendment upheld the right of individuals to possess firearms for self-defense (La Valle 1)."
"Amidst the continuing GFC, the Australian dollar continued to appreciate as a result of the relative strong performance of the domestic economy as compared to other developed economies (Australian Government 2008). Demand for the Australian dollar was strong as Chinese demand for Australian exported minerals continued to grow. As such, the dollar increased to above parity with the US dollar, causing competitiveness issues for Gunns (Gunns Limited 2010, Gunns Limited 2011a). Though the Yen and Australian dollar remained relatively stable in terms of each other, most of the customers Gunns exports to deal in American dollars. Furthermore, the strong domestic currency increased the attractiveness of imports, softening domestic demand for Gunns products as the competitiveness of such products was adversely affected (Gunns Limited 2011a)."
"\u201cRoughly 30,000 people are killed in the U.S. each year by guns\u2014whether by accident, suicide, or homicide according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u201d (Funk and Wagnall\u2019s New World Encyclopedia, 2014). In the case of homicides, the blame cannot be placed on the gun itself. When a murder is committed, there is intent; the intent to kill. If a gun were not available, it is almost certain that a homicidal individual would find another way to commit the crime. The same goes for suicide. If an individual is truly suicidal, there are plenty of other ways to end one\u2019s life besides a gun. Guns are convenient, but that is where the problem lies, not guns themselves. Gun-related accidents are typically the result of someone handling a firearm without proper knowledge of the weapon. In fact, most of them are not accidents, but incidents where common sense and safety were not applied. Even in the cases of accidental shootings involving children, it is common sense to store a weapon where a child cannot gain access to it."
"Mass shootings happen too often and the gun laws remain the same. Lewis (2018) pointed out, \u201cproponents of gun control legislation should wish not only to continue efforts to reduce incidences of mass murder, but also to reduce the number of victims. For example, a ban on gun enhancers such as bump stocks, or a ban on the size of ammunition magazines might be effective in reducing victimization in mass murder incidences\u201d. Bump stocks were found on many of the weapons used in the Las Vegas mass shooting and was what allowed the shooter to injure and kill so many people, so quickly. Considering the quantity of mass shootings in the United States, a significant number of Americans hope that the government will step up and create quality gun laws to prevent a massacre that wipes out the entire population."
"Citizens in America are being killed everyday, and many people believe guns are the problem; because of this the government believes implying gun control will help solve this drawback. By doing this the government hopes to lessen crime rates, and suicides. On the other hand, citizens shouldn\u2019t have gun control because it would reduce their protection, many people aren\u2019t killed by guns, and criminals will still find a way to get guns. To begin, the government shouldn\u2019t enact gun control because it would reduce the citizen\u2019s safety."
"Advocates against guns being on campuses believe that guns will increase shootings in general. A study done by John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health reviews the evidence around the relationship between civilian gun carrying and violent crimes. As well as mass shootings and other factors that are unique to public safety on college campuses. The study also looked at the human brain. From adolescence to adulthood the brain goes through tremendous change and development in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Areas of the PFC are in charge of self-control, impulse control, and judgement. These skills are crucial for safe use of firearms. Risky decision making in adolescence and young adults comes from both the frontal and limbic balance in the brain. Changes between the connection of the PFC and limbic affect the emotional and behavioral regulation. The limbic areas play a key role in the systems that support emotions, reward systems, and drives. This may also help explain why adolescent behavior is biased toward motivation rather than inhibition (Webster). Because the PFC is one of the last parts of the brain to fully develop, it would be dangerous to put guns in the hands of someone who is still developing these skills. On top of the fact that the brain is still developing, the use of illegal drugs and alcohol that occur by some students increase risk of adding a deadly weapon to \u201cthe mix.\u201d This is likely to lead to occurrences of accidental shootings and self-injury."
"Not training teachers would even be a worse idea, that would lead into more problems, being that teachers might not know how to use it and then accidentally use it the wrong way. Even with the proper training, there\u2019s no way a teacher with a weapon can take down a shooter. In conclusion, in Yuval Rosenburg article the average cost a year estimates to about 12 billion a year. Which would not be the best solution to it. Not only to mention the cost of the training and buying the guns. Teachers may be required to renew their training. They may also have to be able to maintain the course knowledge and be tested regularly. All this encounters money and most schools now are already having difficulties with budgeting the cost of needs each school year. Rather than spending the money on something that would cause more problems, they should spend it on something to better the school system that would be beneficial to everyone."
"How can a law be effective if the law has loopholes and no ability to do its duty? The solution to this is to hold individuals accountable when the system fails. Adequate background checks are the key to this ongoing gun control issue. To be diligent in protecting the public from increasing gun violence, the government needs to step up and create a law that is not necessarily an invasion of privacy but a protection of human kind from these weapons of destruction. With that said, the overall gun violence will unfortunately continue to be a regularity as current gun laws are not eliminating the root of the problem."
"The trophy is the animal or part of the animal kept, and usually displayed, to represent the success of the hunt. The primary game sought is usually the oldest and most mature animal from a given population. This is typically a male with the largest body size or largest antlers or horns. However, hunting is activity that can be used as family bond time. Some family enjoy hunting wild turkey and deer."
"We could tell that all is not well; because someone who does not have the courage may find it difficult to report a fellow student to the appropriate authority. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures 16 states banned the carrying of a concealed weapons on a college campus and 23 states left the decision to ban or to allow concealed weapons on campuses to be made by each college or university individually (National Conference of State Legislatures). Sincerely speaking, violence may likely occur in these zones."
"The research proves that gun control is ineffective because it wastes money, and there is no concrete evidence to support that is is effective. The opposition may say that gun laws are effective because the put more people in jail, but this is only a temporary fix that comes at a cost. According to a article written by Eliza Mills, a assistant producer for marketplace.org, \u201cincarceration costs an average of more than $31,000 per inmate, per year, nationwide. In some states, it\u2019s as much as $60,000. Taxpayers foot the bill for feeding, housing and securing people in state and federal penitentiaries (\u201cHow Much Does\u201d)\u201d. This could cost the government hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to hold violators of these gun control laws. Gun laws are ineffective because of illegal gun trafficking and the criminal behavior following a gun restriction. This is because they do not have clear evidence, are expensive to enforce, and cause major disagreements between the public and the legislature. If legislature agreed that it was the person that killed and not the gun, could all of this controversy been avoided?"
"Having firearms around makes gun crime likely to occur. It was Jon Schuppe that report about a research carried out by John Hopkins Group of researchers showing that most fatal mass shootings occurs in places where guns are authorized and that the people with guns were not able to stop this very act of violence. This is actually common everywhere if not all the campus where concealed weapons have been authorized even if the news of violence has not submerged to the attention of the masses."
"African Americans were also more than twice as likely to be personally worried about gun violence, the research found\u201d(PTSD in Oakland: Gun Violence Victims, Families Suffer Continuos PTSD pg 1). However people might say, \u201cSafety isn\u2019t always safe. You can find one on every gun.\u201d(Andrea Gibson). \u201cNothing is wrong with shooting\u2026 As long as the right people get shot\u201d(Clint Eastwood). I say the critics are incorrect because \u201caccording to the Crime Prevention Research Center, so-called \u2018gun free zones\u2019 have been targets of more than 98% of all mass shootings \u2014 this is why they are often fittingly referred to as \u2018soft targets'(Six Facts That show Gun Control Is Not The Answer pg 1). \u201cIn 2005, out of a total of 541 firearm-related deaths in Kentucky, 375 were gun-shot suicides (69%), homicides accounted for 143, accidents claimed 11, nine died in police shootings, and three fatalities were unspecified. During 2006 and 2007, again, approximately 70 percent of gun-shot deaths were suicides. Most Americans are unaware that gun-shot suicide occurs much more often than all other shooting deaths combined. Suicide by gun fire is the fastest growing and most common means of suicide regardless of age, gender, race, or educational level\u201d(Guns: Dangerous Especially For Suicide, and Costly For America pg 1). Gun symbolizes fear and cowardness because they rise against anyone who degrades them. They basically live their lives in fear, and project that fear into violence in order to scare their victims."
"Furthermore, targeting the two percent is even harder with the argument of self defense. Here Wilson argues that assailants are less successful in crimes when victims are able to defend themselves. With the ability to properly protect oneself from robberies the likelihood that would be assailants will attack with a victim present is reduced. Wilson once again relays credible information to the reader, in regards to self defense from the National Crime Survey, by using facts as his selling point. Appealing logically to the reader with the evidence provided presents a strong opinion that is hard to refute. Assuming that their is pro gun control readers out there, arguing against his points, how do you counter this argument with convincing evidence from the author. What measures can we possibly take without negatively impacting the ability to protect oneself and ridding all illegal weapons without committing harassment? Lucky for us Wilson presents a counter of sorts."
"Americans believe that the guns are a sacred emblem of the United States\u2019 independence from Great Britain. However, Haynes asserts that mass shootings have unearthed debates on gun ownership, control and rights (1). Gun violence, which refers to the use of firearms in harming or killing individuals or groups of people has erupted debates on the ownership and issuance of unlicensed guns. Many argue that crime rates that are associated with gun violence can only decline where the US government controls the distributions of guns directly (Haynes 1)."
"There has been a sharp rise in students that considered suicide as the only option while going through stress and other psychological issues such as emotional trauma, anxiousness, mood swing and fear. In most cases students that are slow learners studying courses considered to be too tedious for them may see suicide as the only option to quit, especially if they are new on campus. Giving such innocent students access to a weapon will not only endanger them, but will also make them a threat to each other."
"The mere thought of children at high risk for death by a gun makes the reader think twice about the morality of certain individuals that live in this country. Kristof then proceeds to talks about broadcaster Bryce Williams, who is known for violently shooting two of his former co-workers, Alison Parker and Adam Ward, in Virginia in response to a massacre in a church in South Carolina."
"Policies removing restrictions on gun control laws have changed over the last few decades. The changes are based on assumptions and claims about civilian gun use in populated places. University and colleges have been able to prohibit people from carrying concealed carry on campuses. Now some states have laws that allow individuals who are legally authorized to carry guns to carry them on campuses. The majority of states leave the decision to allow concealed carry guns on campuses up to each school."
"The sociocultural environment has been of utmost importance to Gunns Limited, with operations interrupted and protested against as a result of 30 years of conflict between the company and wider society. Precedent has shown that companies can be shut down, or at least highly adversely affected because of social pressures (O\u2019Brien 2011)."
"In a national survey, 94% of Americans answered \u201cNO\u201d when asked, \u201cDo you think regular citizens should be allowed to bring their guns [onto] college campuses?\u201d (640). This just shows how much students and faculty disagree with concealed carry. However, some people on campus feel safer if they have a gun. There are two sides of this discussion, there are people who say that it should not be legalized to have guns on campus because it would increase danger and violence at school while the opposing side says it should be legal because they feel that it would make them safer and that they would be able to defend certain situations at campus."
"Gun control is the regulation that requires people to keep firearms and mostly the guns away from other people (Carter). According to many people, they take it that gun control is an effective manner to help reduce the number of deaths that are continuously being experienced due to wrong use of guns by some people. It is also a fact that many people think that guns are mostly used to carry out crimes that are mostly experienced in towns and in high populated areas."
"In conclude, after a lot of school shootings constantly happened in the US, it aroused debates about the \u201c Arming teacher\u201d solution that President Donald Trump suggested. There are a lot of disadvantages and advantages to this gun rights as well as many opposite viewpoints toward this issue. However, there are more disadvantages than advantages, more dangerous as well as reducing the teaching quality, and more other problems."
"\u201cPeople should not be forced to sacrifice their lives and property for the benefit of others,\u201d coming straight from the Libertarian platform of principles and beliefs. This is what happens when the \u201cmajority\u201d rules over all American people. The government is in place to serve the American people, not to serve as a hidden agenda for radicals trying to impose things such as One World Order, for example."
"There are many risks allowing concealed weapon on campuses and because of it students and college employees should not be allowed to carry concealed weapons. Students shouldn\u2019t get used to the presence of guns in their classrooms. It is no doubt that public safety is a job for professionally qualified police officers, not teachers or students with absence of expert training. Furthermore, colleges and universities have many individuals who are fighting with some mental health problems such as stress or depression. Therefore, such groups of people are under risk. College students with some mental problems are more likely to use a gun on themselves than to protect themselves. It is just not possible to feel safe when there are guns around you. Many studies have shown that when there is more weapon, there are more gun deaths and more risks for tragedy."
"\u201d Tests are easy to get around, and I would assume especially ones testing sanity. All you would have to do is say the right answer, say what they want to hear. If someone really wants a gun, they will get it and no amount of middle-men, fees, and tests will stop it."
"No one, however, described him, his behaviors or his communications as overtly aggressive or violent\u201d (Geragthy). This man that committed this mass shooting showed no possible signs of even being a mass shooter at all. He was a normal guy in the eyes of everyone he knew and from what police could find. The shooter got his guns legally and passed his background checks but still committed a heinous crime. This goes to show that even though having a red flag law can possibly help reduce gun violence, it does not stop it because as long as someone can remain undetectable in the eyes of the law and everyone else then an event such as the Dayton shooting can happen again which is extremely unsettling."
"According to gun-control.procon.org \u201cA majority of adults, including gun owners, support common-sense gun control such as background checks, bans on assault weapons, and bans on the high-capacity magazine\u201d/ \u201c97% of American voters and 97% of gun owners support universal background checks. 67% support a nationwide ban on assault weapons, and 83% support mandatory waiting periods for gun purchases.\u201d Gun control laws would reduce the societal costs associated with gun violence. High powerful guns are used in almost every mass murder."
"Consequentially, new laws have been made to target the two percent but are in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The problem that lies is in either quantity of police officers or the stigma of police harassment. The Fourth Amendment \u201cbans \u2018unreasonable searches and seizures\u2019\u201d(Wilson 126) which makes it hard for police officers to employ stop and frisk tactics without crossing the line. From the examples given there are only a certain set of rules that can legally allow a stop and frisk which explains he then explains most police officers do not. Because of these limiting factors Wilson provides this statement from Harvard University professor Mark Moore \u201cmost weapon arrests were made because a citizen complained, not because the police were out looking for guns.\u201d(Wilson 126). Wilson counters that these factors can be avoided by providing ample training and a list of parolees on their beat. Here is a fallacy because there is only so many times a police officer can perform a stop and frisk on a parolee without it resulting in harassment. Same can be said with ample training as many instances of legal stop and frisks were deemed to be harassment as well. In my opinion, there is a fine line in deeming what is constitutional and harassment that might be too small to reasonably target the two percent."
"In conclusion, the more guns and other weapons are made available to the campus environment, the higher the risk of assaults and violence on students, professors and to other college staff. We should always keep in mind that concealed weapons are dangerous to life. There is need to learn, because, the more we learn the better we will be able to protect ourselves from firearms and assaults on campus and the dangers of having them on campus."
"This topic is usually very derisive anytime the topic of gun control introduced with opponents of gun control heavily invested with the ability to protect themselves. Here the author uses another statistic from a household survey by a criminologist at Florida State University stating that \u201c\u2026every year, guns are used \u2013 that is, displayed or fired \u2013 for defensive purposes more than a million times\u2026\u201d(Wilson 126). From this statistic alone he, along with the reader, can logically conclude that guns are more good than bad. So how do we determine better gun control that pinpoints the two percent while allowing the public to aptly defend themselves?"
"The issue of gun control in America is nothing new to anyone. Everyone has their own opinion as to whether or not we should readily have access to weapons as American citizens. In the words of Ron Paul, a 79-year-old former House of Representatives member, \u201cRespecting the right of the people to keep and bear arms is the original and best homeland security policy. Restricting the right of people to arm themselves leaves them with no effective defense against violent criminals or a tyrannical government."
"Administrators and public officials met with Sarkeesian and made plans to increase security, however, once Sarkeesian learned Utah State allowed guns on campus and the faculty could not guarantee a gun-free audience, she canceled her appearance. \u201cIn that decision, we witnessed one of the first clear examples of how laws allowing concealed weapons on a college campuses can thwart academic freedom and First Amendment rights to free speech\u201d (Sinor). As of 2014, legislators in fourteen states have passed and introduced laws allowing concealed weapons on college campuses. Even after faculty members, public officials, and administrators have voiced their opinion that they do not want guns on campuses, they are not in charge of making the decision. Across the country, state legislators are regulating campus culture, and in doing so they are restricting university officials, threatening academic freedom, and interfering with the education of students (Sinor). Professors may even choose to change course content because of a perceived threat or they may retire early or quit their jobs at a college campus that permits guns."
"The number of gun deaths is alarming. Over the past decade, on average, more than 33,000 Americans have died from guns. Two third of them were suicides. About 1,300 victims were killed in domestic violence involving guns- 586 cases by accident, 11,000 homicides, and hundred killed by shooting. Mass shootings have become deadlier and seem to happen frequently. From 2000 to 2015 the numbers of shootings have increase more than doubled- there are four out of five incredible deadliest shootings had happened in past five years that shaken American History. Beside that 2017 is the year where most of the mass shootings that had big casualties take place compare to any years (Wall Street Journal).FBI shows that because the mass shootings increasing from the straight line from 2000 then from 2013 the shootings have increased dramatically we can call it as a \u201c rising trend\u201d, where the shooters follow the trend when there are more and more (FBI). The FBI have shown how the mass shootings growing big from 1982 until now in figure 1 and the figure has shown 2017 is the year of mass shootings."
"If Gun Control laws increased it will decrease the amount of crime in the The United States Such as School shootings, Massive Murder, and armed robbers and etc. Gun Control Laws will decrease crime. A high-capacity magazine should be less available for people, and gun laws should increase. According to Procon.org \u201cHigh-capacity magazines should be banned because they too often turn murder into mass murder.\u201d/ \u201cHigh-capacity magazines were used in at least 50% of the 62 mass shootings between 1982 and 2012.\u201d Background checks on gun owners should be necessary on getting High capacity magazines."
"\u201c\u2026an example of how gun violence beget gun violence.\u201d (Kristof). Kristof believes that Williams may have been mentally disturbed because he videotaped the killings and posted them onto a social media platform. However, that does not change the fact that policies on guns are very loose. Kristof introduces certain safety measures that should be taken in order to improve guns. He strongly feels as if the government does that address gun deaths as a serious issue. A couple suggestions the author mentions are passcodes and stern background checks for individuals purchasing guns."
"In both articles, there was a lot of disagreement between Trump and Clinton on different topics. In article one, they argued on guns. Trumps wants to run a strong defender of gun rights. On the other hand, Clinton wants to take guns away. She just does not want people to be shot by someone who should not have a gun in the first place. She wants to expand on background checks for gun buyers. In the second article, there were many topics where both candidates disagreed."
"Gunns Limited are a forestry enterprise based in Tasmania, with market capitalization of $204 million. Gunns undertook a pronounced change of strategic direction in 2010, attempting to revitalize itself and ensure future success after poor recent social and financial performance. This strategic direction was not allayed into financial success in the following year, 2011, with a loss reported of $355.5m."
"In order to pass a bill, introduce by coming up with a great idea find a Senator or Representative to sponsor it, draft the bill, gather signatures from other legislators and then introduce your bill by dropping it in the hopper. You\u2019ll need support from the Committee Chair if you want a hearing or at least get them interested in hearing more. If your bill receives a hearing, it\u2019s an opportunity to bring in members of the public to show their support. You\u2019ll need to make sure a majority of the committee supports your bill or it won\u2019t move forward meaning a lot of meetings, phone calls, and advocacy efforts. After a bill is passed out of committee, it goes to the Rules Committee, which decides which bills will receive a vote. You\u2019ll need to ask a member of the Rules Committee to conduct a \u201crules pull\u201d so your bill can be voted upon. Once your bill makes it to the floor, you\u2019ll need to make sure it gets a majority or it\u2019s dead. Repeat Steps 2-5 but with the opposite house. Your bill needs to pass out of the House or Senate with the exact same wording. If that doesn\u2019t happen because of amendments, it\u2019s sent to a Concurrence Committee, a group of legislators who will try to reconcile the two drafts. If your bill makes it through this process it goes to the governor\u2019s desk."
"-Education about fire-arms and gun safety is needed to prevent deaths; not more gun-control(Con): Almost all of the US gun owners truly believe that children should learn about gun safety. \u201cGuns don\u2019t kill people; people kill people\u201d. Citizens also need more gun education and screening on mental illnesses to prevent horrible actions."
"The scene is heartbreaking. These images create three emotions in rapid succession; sorrow, grief and then anger. It\u2019s a new found by product of this immediate gratification technology; Emotion manipulation. It\u2019s why we have become so dependent on the 24 hour news. It manipulates our emotions. It gives us highs and lows. What evokes more emotion than the tragic shooting of innocents. These shootings become a media circus. It sells. Reporters covering these events become celebrities. They move from local to national exposure. There are media experts and analysts that move in, they create excitement and insight into mindset and actions. They create biographies of the tragic victims and they sensationalize the perpetrator. According to the recent studies, there exists evidence shortage regarding the effect of most laws on gun control. However, a study conducted by RAND Corporation (2018) revealed that there exist numerous effects brought about by gun policies."
"The craziest people are the ones that you see everyday walking down hallways and streets. They could be the people that you drive by or stand in line behind. When people buy guns, what if they don\u2019t start out crazy and get there? Eventually some people break and there\u2019s noone who can predict the future and be able to say, \u201cYeah that person is going to go nuts in three years on the twenty-seventh of May and try to shoot up a bank."
"Lawmakers should require training on how to safely secure firearms in the homes of citizens. Lawmakers should also diminish gun access to youth and people who are capable of injuring others or even themselves. Weapon should be retained from individuals who have been vicious toward their peers, and those who have a history of violent tendicies."
"The wrong use of guns by some people does not mean that guns should not be possessed especially in areas where security details are compromised. In real sense, it is true that guns are not responsible for the many deaths that occur every year as there are other causes of deaths in the society. I think that possession of guns should not be controlled for a number of reasons, mostly for the purpose of improving safety within the society."
"For example Chicago, IL has some the most strict gun laws but the highest crime rate. Majority of the mass shooting happen in gun free zones. There is a quite a bit of school shooting each year, and there is no one armed at most schools which makes them a easy target for mass shootings. Is there shooting at gun stores?"
"\u201d(Ron Paul, 2014) According to the Second Amendment to the Constitution, we have the right to keep and bear arms. However, over the past few years, there has been an uproar in anti-gun protesting, due to massacres such as the Sandy Hooke Elementary shootings. They all basically have the same approach, \u201cguns kill people, so we should take them away.\u201d This statement is false in every single aspect possible. There are in fact law in place that restrict certain people from owning guns, but making them illegal to own is pointless."
"However, guns are necessary in a violent world. They provide protection for muggings, home invasions, terrorist incidents and mass shooting. Furthermore, if the people have the possibility to possess guns in the worst-case scenario, they can use them against the tyranny. Should it ever come to insurrection, then the people would have the means to rise in armed revolt against the authorities and overthrow them. Even if it never comes to that, the threat of armed rebellion will help preserve government from tyranny."
"However, many others express their disappointment at lawmakers and special interest groups who use mass shootings as vehicles for pushing personal political agendas (Boylan et al. 3934). For example, the NRA has failed to mount major lobbying pushes to make sure that lawmakers agree with the view that guns do not kill people. Where shootings occur, the NRA is often passive and only asks for prayers for the victims and their families while making sure that anything else is inappropriate. Lawmakers echo the views of the NRA that access to guns is irrelevant to discussions on gun violence and that bringing it up after a mass shooting is irrelevant and disrespectful. The only legislation with a chance of becoming a law is a bill banning the manufacture and sale of high capacity machine guns (Haynes 1). Bold Supreme Court rulings encourage judicial scrutiny of gun control legislations that fail to pass Congress or state legislature."
"Among the developed nations today, the United States is one of the rare countries where arms rights are inscribed in the constitution. Accompanying the possession and use of firearms, the once-great power of the world is also where gun violence occurs likely every single day, sometimes with catastrophic consequences, such as the latest shooting on February 14, 2018, happened at Marjory Stoneman Douglas (MSD) High School, a former student walked into school and shot 34 people and 14 of them died where others are injured."
"Although the issue surrounding it are complex, I believe the public policy on Gun Control is situational and in recent years has been \u201cweaponized\u201d to manipulate specific agendas.The latest mass shootings horrify all of us. Whether it\u2019s a school, a club or a public event, the hopeless circumstances surrounding the situation terrify us. They are our nightmare. This is happening, and I am powerless; I can neither flee nor fight. I have no control over the situation."
"No guns around us means less murders and that is a good reason to get rid of guns completely. No other developed country has such a high rate of gun violence like USA. At this moment there are many countries that have outright banned the sale, use and ownership of guns, in those countries the murders and accidental death rate is far lower than in the USA."
"Not only does the U.S Government have the right to interpret the amendments but they also can repeal them, and repealing an amendment is actually something that has occured in the past and therefore it is perfectly legal and possible. The 18th amendment was ratified on January 19th 1919, and banned manufacturing and distribution of alcohol. The 18th amendment was formed because of the Temperance Movement where many US Citizens pledges absolutism from alcohol because they believed it was behind every sin, and because of the ideals of the Progressive Movement in the 20th century. This resulted in terrible economic problems due to the loss of the liquor industry and profit from importation and exportation of these products. The 18th amendment was repealed with the ratification of the 21st amendment. According to The Interactive Constitution in addition to stating that the production, distribution, and possession of alcohol is prohibited, the 21st Amendment also states, \u201cThe eighteenth article of amendment to the Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed.\u201d (American Constitution Society) Therefore the United States Government is perfectly capable of repealing the Second Amendment and would only need to ratify a new amendment that states the repeal of the Second Amendment and explains the new terms of gun control and firearm rights of U.S citizens. If economic troubles were enough to make the U.S Government ratify the 21st amendment to repeal the previous one shouldn\u2019t the staggering amount of deaths due to gun violence have the same effect. Not to mention that deaths due to a lack of gun control are having a negative economic impact on the United States. In a Journal of Risk and Insurance Jean Lemaire states, \u201cThe aggregate cost of gun violence in the United States at about $100 billion annually, or about $360 for every American.\u201d (Lemaire) Meaning not only has an amendment been repealed in the past but, in addition to high death rates, the gun control issue is having a negative economic impact which happens to be one of the main reasons that the 18th Amendment was repealed."
"This is only one of the many horrifying events that question the government\u2019s regulations on guns in our country. As a result many ideas regarding regulating access to guns have been brought up. Although the question remains. What is the right thing to do? On June 21 1788 the constitution was ratified and the second amendment gave all citizens the right to bear arms. But why was this right so important to the founding fathers that it had to be the 2nd amendment?"
"Personally, I think there should not be a gun control law, but we should make it harder for criminals to get their hands on. Whenever there\u2019s a story on the news that involves an outbreak of shootings or a massacre, people always turn their heads on the gun when in reality, it\u2019s the person behind the gun that operates the entire weapon."
"In the last few years, there has been a tremendous amount of school shootings around the world. Like Sandy Hook Elementary were Adam Lanza fatally shot and killed 20 students and 6 staff members. Since then the students, teachers and concerned citizens have be wondering as to what needs to be done to end mass shootings in America. The question is, will arming teachers with concealed weapons be the right answer to solving this issue. In this paper I will be taking about the danger a gun will have on the students and teachers in class, the cost of training it will cost for teachers to be trained and the stress teacher will be under from the fear it will bring to them to protect there students."
