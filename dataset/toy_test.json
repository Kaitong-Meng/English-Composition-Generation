"(Reinhart, 2018).\u00a0 Numerous of people feel there is no need for gun control laws. They often think the laws will violate their constitutional right to bear arms. The Second Amendment ensures individuals ideal to own a gun not connected with military personnel, and to utilize that arm for customarily legalized purposes, such as protection in one\u2019s home. Legislatures are currently considering something very unique: pressing together enemy of firearm control laws that supplant private requesting by making it troublesome or illicit for private gatherings to keep weapons out of their homes, off their property, and generally out of their real or helpful possession."
"For example, Vermont has limited gun laws much like Louisiana, but their firearm murder rate is low. Representatives of Louisiana looks at the state as \u201cthe state that protects itself\u201d. State officials are looking out for the safety of their own residents by allowing citizens to legally conceal and carry a firearm. But the same amount of effort is not put in to clean the streets of illegal weapons. From the year 2005 to the year 2014, nine-thousand four-hundred and forty-eight people died to do to illegal firearm violence. In the year of 2014, that rate placed Louisiana as 13th highest in the nation. And Louisiana also places 6th highest in the rate of other violent crimes and we have the 3rd highest poverty rate. It is also proven that states with high levels of gun violence are often the poorest states in the country. Louisiana is considered in that range of states. Unintentional firearm deaths and suicides have greater numbers than people actually think."
"The only people who should be able to have guns are the people actively serving in the army at that moment in time. That\u2019s only for safety though. When the soldier comes home it should still be at their base. They should not be able to have it to whip around. This would only work in a perfect world where no civilians have any guns, excluding laser tag guns. A good alternative to bullets in guns would be legos and glitter. Those items would be perfect because legos are horrible to step on and the glitter would confuse the enemy. A war would be won immediately. In the rare event that all guns worked like that, then everyone could have a gun. If someone owns a gun illegally there should be extreme consequences. There is no good that can come from a gun. Guns were made and were evolved to kill and injure. People who own illegal guns should go to jail, simple as that. People go to jail for possession of marijuana, which is illegal, why not illegal guns? Guns are deadlier than drugs and have worse intentions. I would put someone in jail six months for every illegal gun they have and then confiscate them. For people to learn a lesson, the hard hand has to come down. There should be very limited places where a gun is allowed."
"New Orleans firearm murder rate is almost sixty people for every one-hundred thousand people. In the year 2011, New Orleans had the highest firearm death rate than any other city in the United States. New Orleans is also 4th in the nation for highest firearm deaths right now. In the year of 2017, one in every five people murdered was a child and that\u2019s not counting accidental shootings that took the lives of children. New Orleans has come a long way from what it used to be when it comes to murder and gun violence. But that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be made an even better place. Even though 2018 was a slightly good year for New Orleans with that year having the lowest amount of firearm deaths in nearly a century, the gun violence has not settled down. Someone loses their life almost every day in New Orleans, LA. People of all ages and professions could be a target of violence. It is so out of control, you never know who could be next. Even the rate for non-fatal shootings is sky high almost every year along with the murder rate. Fatalities of gun violence to children are mostly due to the availability of firearms in the state. Not to mention that we are almost best known for our weak gun laws."
"I don\u2019t think anyone should have gun. It\u2019s a little late for that though, a couple hundred years late. We need more things that save and help than kill people. Not everyone in the US can and does have Health Care while it\u2019s possible for every single one of us to have guns. The amount of guns in the United States is significantly higher than the amount of citizens."
"Gun-control advocates point out that federal regulations have forced car makers to incorporate such features as seat belts and airbags, thus making cars far safer than they were in the past. The reason this has not been done with firearms is that gun industry, backed by gun-rights groups like the NRA, successfully lobbied Congress to bar the Consumer Product Safety Commission from regulating firearms."
"Gun violence is a sensitive subject that has been constantly debated about over the past couple of decades. Having the ability to purchase something that can easily end someone\u2019s life without harsh restrictions can be confusing in some eyes. With the rise of the recent mass shootings people are pressuring law makers to have stricter gun control or just to outright ban them. There have been many suggestions in reducing gun violence that have been proposed such as red flag laws, banning assault rifles, and having better background checks."
"Allowing college students and other college employees to carry concealed weapons on campus has the potential to make the learning environment safer. It is necessary to notice that currently, some states have passed laws allowing concealed gun carry on campus. Proponents of this law argued that carrying concealed weapons is necessary measure of protection that gives students the opportunity to protect themselves. Lawmakers say that students want to feel safe and have the opportunity to protect themselves in dangerous and critical situations."
"The Washington Times reports that \u201c91.5% of 15,000 law enforcement officers believed that a gun bans would have little to no effect on gun violence\u201d (\u201cLaw Enforcement\u201d). Even though some may say that gun laws do nothing but benefit the community, it actually works against it. The second reason that gun laws are ineffective is because it gun related crimes have increased since gun control laws have been emplaced. This reason is supported because \u201cthrough the percentages of homicides caused by a firearm during a felony rose\u201d (\u201cRight\u201d). This shows that even with the new gun laws in place, the violence continues to grow. An increase in violence of \u201c5.6% in the past 5 years has led to to over 17% of the total annual deaths in the United States\u201d (\u201cRight\u201d)."
"\u201cGun Control Doesn\u2019t Work.\u201d Which brings us to another key argument of the gun-rights movement\u2013that no matter how many gun-control laws are passed, criminals will still get guns and use them against the public. Only law-abiding citizens will obey gun laws, and if those laws discourage gun ownership, then criminals will gain an edge over the rest of us. In the words of journalist J. Neil Schulman: \u201cThe decent people need to be better armed than the criminals, or the criminals will win.\u201d"
"The increasing number of shootings in universities and other institutions caused a debate with the issue of carrying concealed weapons on campuses. Mostly, the concealed weapon has been forbidden in schools, colleges and universities campuses. But some state laws allow students to carry their weapons on campus. Moreover, supporters of this idea are sure that it is a practicable solution to prevent mass shootings on college campuses. So, allowing college students and teachers to carry concealed weapons on campus is a big debate of US society that has its supporters and opponents."
"Post-GFC, the Japanese market in particular was showing signs of recovery, an important revelation due to the position of Japan as the largest export market for Gunns, accounting for 60% of volume of export sales (Gunns Limited 2011a). However, the March occurrence of a large-scale earthquake in Japan offset this positive development. The operations of two large Japanese customers were adversely affected, decreasing the potential for export revenue for Gunns (Denslow, Longid and Sam Cho 2011, Gunns Limited 2011a, RISI 2011). An estimated 7% of sales were lost to the Japanese earthquake effects (Clark 2011)."
"Gun-control advocates have claimed that terrorists or their supporters were buying weapons at U.S. gun shows and shipping them to terrorists overseas. The NRA said the convictions proved that existing laws work when they are enforced. \u201cPassing gun show restrictions will in no way deter such a committed criminal,\u201d the NRA declared. \u201cThat can only be done by aggressive law enforcement action, like we saw in this case.\u201d"
"Although many claim that because the current restrictions do little to prevent gun related crime adding more restrictions would not have any significant effect, studies conducted exhibit that even the process of obtaining a permit can have a positive effect on the drop in crime. In a study conducted on shall-issue states vs. may-issue states, data showed that,\u201d carry permitting laws were significantly associated with 6.5% higher total homicide rates, 8.6% higher firearm-related homicide rates, and 10.6% higher handgun-specific homicide rates compared with may-issue states. In this study, may-issue vs shall issue refers to whether an individual shall receive or will receive a permit to carry a handgun after clearing a background check."
"Previous to the strategic realignment in 2010, Gunns typically ignored social pressures in favour of chasing productivity and profitability gains (Forestry Tasmania 2011, Gunns Limited 2010). This resulted in extensive conflict and climaxed with Gunns decision to withdraw from the native forest industry and instead use certified plantation resources to supply the pulp mill. This decision resulted from extensive discussion with community and environmental groups, and predicated the signing of the Statement of Forest Principles by both parties in September 2010 (Gunns Limited 2011a). This significant increase in the stakeholder engagement of Gunns is a result of the positive consequences that arise from a strategic change that identifies weak points and transforms them into strengths that complement the other core competencies of the business (Astrom et. al 2010)"
"This is an obvious statement, basic cause-and-effect. There were 464,033 gun-related deaths between the years 2000 and 2013; only 2.2% of these deaths were unintentional. At 66% guns were the leading cause of death by homicide in 2015. A study by Lancet in March of 2016 found that firearm-related deaths could be reduced by a projected 57% if federal universal background checks were implemented. These same background checks for ammo could reduce these deaths by 80.7%, and gun identification requirements would deplete them by 82.5%. Many who oppose stricter gun control laws have similar concerns. A common statement is, \u201cguns don\u2019t kill people, people kill people.\u201d However, if you take the firearm away from a man who has intentions to enter a school and initiate a mass shooting, how will he shoot those people? This statement is ignorant; it is similar to saying \u201cmethaphetamines do not kill people, people kill people,\u201d yet if you were to take the fatal factor of the equation, there would be no ability of the person to kill."
"The people of the United States are living in terrible firearm conditions where they experience anxiety about going to places nearby out of fear of getting attacked by somebody with a gun, and the number of innocent people dying because of a firearm is increasing and has left families devastated. Though many may like to argue against gun control by saying it is vital to protecting people from home invasions or other life threatening events, the research shows that not only are guns statistically not not used as self defense but there also are many alternative weapons that have been proven more effective. Overall the United States is in desperate need for gun control that takes away the right to bear arms from all U.S Citizens. Repealing the Second Amendment is the solution the United States needs, and is justified because the Second Amendment no longer reflects gun conditions in the United States. Times have changed and our legal system needs to reflect that change."
"As a nation, America understands the need to address the situation of gun violence. He continues by stating that there are bills debated in Congress with the potential solutions to decreasing gun-related incidents across the nation but are being refuted. Additionally, the author provides valid examples including a bill vetoed by Gov. Jerry Brown in 2013 that would\u2019ve \u201cbanned semi-automatic rifles\u201d with \u201cdetachable magazines\u201d- which would lessen the ammo round in the affected guns. Prominently, in the past, congress has been faced with the simple decision of allowing effective legislation to pass but decides to refute it yet when another tragic shooting occurs, politicians suddenly work to erect solutions but ultimately no resolution is passed- and the cycle perpetually repeats itself. Overall, the article presents sufficient substance and valid examples to illustrate the ridiculous antics of Congress when it comes to resolving the issue of increasing gun violence in America. Both houses of Congress needs to stop alluding to gun legislation as a bi-partisan issue but rather as an epidemic that is affecting thousands of lives in the country in order to ensure the enactment of effective legislation."
"Overall, this method of preventing homicide and suicide through the use of firearms treats the social issue as a symptom of a broken mental health care system and is largely centered around potential perpetrators compared to the more traditional method of assessing the problem as an issue in current gun legislature. In contrast with the previous method of prevention, imposing stricter gun control policies aims to correct day-to-day gun related crimes as well as mass shootings. As basis of its argument, the case for reducing gun violence through analyzes existing data about gun laws put into place and their effect on crime through statistics. Researchers then use data to form conclusions about the expected outcomes of proposed gun control laws."
"It is also good if the law allows everybody of sound mind to possess a gun, should there be sufficient information or evidence that their safety is in doubt or that they fear being attacked for some reasons. It is true that gun laws have been established all over in the United State but the specific laws varies from one state to another. It is in these laws that specifications of the minimum age of possessing a gun are indicated and special conditions that determine whether a person qualifies to buy and possess a gun or not. A good example is in Colorado where one is allowed to purchase a gun so long as they have attained 18 years (Carter). In other places, the law requires that you have a hunting license for you to be around to buy and possess a gun. These regulations are not appropriate in the sense that they allow some people to possess guns due to some qualifications while others are locked out. It is for this reason that they have been an emergence of illegal gun businesses in the United States because some of the qualified persons ends up buying the guns and later selling them to those that are not permitted to buy them from registered dealers. It is for this reason that those people who illegally obtain these guns are free to get involved in crimes using the guns because that they will not be traced in an event of crime where they use the guns."
"Furthermore, the majority of students on campus during their first year of studies are between the age of 18 and 22. This age is recognized worldwide as a responsibility age. Most students at this time of their life tend to hang around with friends in parties, and also want to get high with alcohol. This could lead to self harm when taking excessively, especially by those with concealed weapons. It is like an officer that left his duty post to take alcohol and took more than he could handle, and was called to attend to ongoing attacks under such a state. He could pull the trigger but if he does; he might end up killing innocent Americans. If the police officer would do that, then a student could do worse."
"Advocates for allowing firearms on campuses believe it will decrease mass shootings. These people also blame mass shooting on \u201cgun-free zones\u201d and argue arming more individuals can stop mass shootings. However, eighty- four percent of high fatality mass shootings happened in areas where there was no law prohibiting firearms. While twelve percent of all mass shooting involving six or more people between 1966 and 2016 have occurred in true \u201cgun free zones\u201d, people who are untrained in using a firearm cannot be expected to protect themselves or people around them (Beck)."
"If concealed carry was legal to students on college, it could potentially increase the probability of suicides in college campuses. In a study found by SGFS says, \u201cOne study found that 24 percent of college students had thought about attempting suicide and 5 percent had actually attempted to kill themselves\u2019 (641). What this implies is that not only is it dangerous to other people, but it can also be dangerous to the person who is wielding the gun. Most students cannot handle some situations and they think the easy way out is to commit suicide, and if concealed carry was allowed then the option of suicide would be likely. Adding guns to the mix of suicidal thoughts would just make the process of suicide much easier than if they weren\u2019t present to the student. SGFS also states, \u201cSuicide attempts are successful more than 90 percent of the time when a firearm is used\u201d (641). As SGFS states the percentage of suicides in college could more likely happen and make suicide attempts more successful if the gun was presented to a student. The suicide rates are already high and adding guns to college campuses would just increase the chances even higher. If guns were legalized these suicide attempts could lead to actual suicides and therefore increase the probability of suicides."
"In the last decade, social awareness of the impact of business on the environment has strongly increased (Golds 2011, Panwar et. al 2006). This sociocultural trend has become an important concern for businesses looking to maximise productivity and competitiveness (Shrivastava and Scott 2007). The significance of this trend in social values is exemplified in the construction of purpose built bodies including the \u2018Australian Forestry Standard\u2019 and \u2018Private Forests Australia\u2019 which aim to secure a sustainable, environmentally sound future for the Australian forestry industry (Forestry Tasmania 2011)."
"Fundamentally, advocates of preventing gun violence through mental health treatment seek to avert tragedies by facilitating treatment and early identification of disorders in individuals that may result harmful to themselves or others. Like most issues, the first step to treatment is identifying the problem at hand, however \u201cidentification of mental illness can be both more subde and more complex, even for those with a psych/mental health background\u201d. As a solution, many professionals suggest allocating government funds to make mental health services more affordable/accessible and educating communities on mental illness. In addition, by training staff and coworkers in schools and workplaces to identify red flags indicating potential violence would ease problem management. Once identified, \u201che or she could overcome these issues with support and therapy\u201d, thus preventing prospective violence."
"A third writer, Dave Anderson / List land, states that teachers will be under a lot of stress from the responsibility having a gun could carry onto them and being fearful of the danger it may cause. Teachers already have a lot on there hands with it already be stressful enough and then adding a gun would make it more stressful for them. Teachers take care of there students like their own. Many students get really attached to there favorite teacher. They are like parents and mentors to their students. Also, teachers are the most stressed people in their community. For most of them adding guns too, is like asking them to be there legal guardian."
"Due to that traumatizing incident, I strongly believe that strengthening the process for purchasing guns is vital. Adam is an exemplar of why background checks and screenings for individuals who purchase guns are necessary. Nicholas Kristof shines light on several flaws of gun security in the United States in his article \u201cKristof: Lessons from the Virginia Shooting\u201d. I completely agree with the authors opinion and I believe that gun violence could be lessened if the screening of gun purchasers was mandatory. According to the author, more than 33,000 people in America get murdered by being shot every year (Kristof). In order to decrease the high rate of lives lost by guns, I think that guns should be remodeled and improved. Serious measures should be taken in order to protect innocent lives. While smartphones and cars are being improved daily, guns have yet to undergo a drastic advantageous change. I agree with Kristof\u2019s point of view on gun violence and control. Guns can be extremely dangerous weapons if mishandled and I believe that more laws and regulations should be made in order to save the lives of many innocent people."
"There are a lot of citizens that favor instituting a gun control law in hopes to lower the chances of a mass shooting. \u201cBetween 1982 and 2012, the US had roughly sixty-two mass shootings. That\u2019s an astonishing number\u2026 this research by Mother Jones shows that, of those sixty-two shootings, forty-nine were perpetrated using legal weapons\u201d (\u201c10 Arguments for Gun Control \u2013 Listverse\u201d)."
"With the Supreme Court\u2019s embrace of the second amendment rights and Republican control over the House of Representatives, new congressional action appears unlikely. Gun-related policy developments at the state level have occurred as a response to the lack of will by Congress. For example, the Ohio State Supreme Court handed gun advocates a victory in 2010 by ruling that Cleveland and other cities were barred from passing stricter laws on assaults weapon restrictions and hand-gun registration requirements apart from those of the state (Wagner and Machnowski 1). Even with the increased focus, state legislatures have only succeeded in passing prohibitions such as concealment in few states. Future federal gun control efforts will go through the NRA, which is famous for its muscular approach in influencing policy. The NRA has also spent billions of dollars on federal lobbying with its political action committee reporting millions of spending on mid-term election campaigns (Boylan et al. 3934). Gun advocates also hold key positions that hinder the passing of additional gun control measures in Congress."
"These gun laws are found as preemption laws because they are pushed to be changed every day. I agree with the right to bear arms unless that individual is not fit for a firearm. Eventually, the only way the state is going to be able to fix the illegal gun problem is to modify our current gun laws. In Louisiana, the only permit you need for a firearm is when you carry it publicly and conceal it. No permit is required to buy a firearm in our state unless it is fully automatic."
"\u201cMost everyone will agree that felons, addicts, morons, juveniles, alcoholics, the mentally incompetent and others in whose hands even an ice pick or baseball bat becomes a deadly weapon, should be denied guns.\u201d(Selib 202). But banning all hand guns is not the way to go about lowering the rate of crimes involving hand guns. As an example: . . . in the decade from 1960 to 1970, gun crimes in England increased some 750 percent \u2013 this in a country where there aren\u2019t supposed to be any pistols in private hands. What is demonstrated forcefully in England is that in a place where guns are outlawed, only outlaws have guns. (202)"
"Most of the children and teen deaths are done by another child or teen that has access to a firearm. Baton Rouge is widely known through the state for being state capital but also being murder capital. A gun is even allowed to be carried on a college campus in Louisiana as long as its legal and it has to be concealed with proof of a permit. Baton Rouges murder rate has gone up at least ten percent a year for the last five years. 2017 was by far the worst year yet for Baton Rouge because they almost caught up with Chicago\u2019s murder rate by firearms that year. And everyone knows that is not an easy task, noting that Chicago has record-breaking numbers almost every year when it comes to murder and violence. In 2017, East Baton Rouge Parish had a record high of one-hundred and six killings due to firearms that year. The record was broken in 2017, topping 2007\u2019s record of 96 firearm deaths. The year of 2017 actually went up seventy-percent from 2016\u2019s year having only sixty-two firearm deaths. Someone is killed almost every week in Baton Rouge, La due to firearm outrage and weak laws."
"The first reason is also supported because when guns are restricted, it simply makes it so anyone who owns a restricted gun is then punishable. The point is also proven because 13% of gun violence convicts end up getting hold of another fire arm through the illegal market, and go on to commit another crime. This research proves my point because it shows that it is not the guns that are doing the damage, it is the people. In addition, Andrea Noble, a crime and public safety reporter for."
"Gun control is a subject that is being debated and will continue to be debated for years to come. There are many different views of what causes crime. Some say crimes caused by guns and others say that it is the people behind the guns. In James Q. Wilson\u2019s essay entitled \u201cJust Take Away Their Guns\u201d, he tries to propose some solutions that would solve the gun control debate. Of course, every plan of action is going to have it\u2019s drawbacks, and Wilson\u2019s has some major ones."
"Guns have become a threat to society and therefore no one should be trusted using a gun. For instance, \u201cMost firearms deaths among kids and teens were intentional, with 53 percent of deaths classified as homicides, and 38 percent deemed suicides, according to the study. Only about 6 percent of deaths involving firearms were classified as unintentional\u201d (Huffington Post: Guns are now the third leading causes of death para 6 sent. 1-2). \u201cEvery day, 310 people are shot in the United States. Among those: 100 people are shot and killed, 210 survive gun injuries, 95 are injured in an attack, 61 die from suicide, 10 survive a suicide attempt, 1 is killed unintentionally, 90 are shot unintentionally, 1 is killed by legal intervention, 4 are shot by legal intervention, 1 died but the intent was unknown, 12 are shot but the intent was unknown\u201d(Key Gun Violence Statistics pg 1). \u201cMost people who attempt suicide do not die-unless they use a gun."
"The right of free speech, the right to defend oneself, the right to go freely about one\u2019s business without harassment, the right freely to associate, and the right to private property and due process, were all considered so obvious that many during the ratification process of the Constitution thought them unnecessary to enumerate CITE. However, scholars insisted that those rights, so obvious to all at the time as to be self-evident, should be explicitly listed in the Bill of Rights so that there could be no ambiguity CITE. President Obama is one to push for gun control. Although he is trying to protect Americans from guns, he is constantly being protected from a team of agents who are armed with firearms."
"Guns can be obtained relatively easily due to the lack of strict screening. Therefore, it can end up in anyone\u2019s possession. As a result, gun violence has been a growing problem in the United States. In middle school, I remember starting to hear about gun violence on the news. I also noticed that mass shootings were occurring more frequently, especially in school settings. Kristof mentions that our firearm homicide rates are 600 times higher than South Korea. He also speaks about gun limitation and reduction. I completely agree with the author and I think that gun limitation is very important. Personally, I think that he was very logical with how he approached the topic of gun control and safety. Kristof mentions many different solutions in order to decrease the amount of gun violence in the United States. He suggests limiting gun purchases to one a month in order to reduce trafficking. I think that through limiting the purchases of guns for one individual, many lives could potentially be saved. The author also states in his article that 92 Americans have their lives claimed by guns daily (Kristof). In my opinion, gun violence is absolutely unacceptable. No individual should live in fear of being shot in their own neighborhood."
"Many believe in the idea that more gun laws would infringe upon their right to bear arms granted by the Second Amendment. This is not true. The Second Amendment does not grant any person unlimited right to own firearms, as many who are less than fully educated on this topic believe it does. The right of any given person to carry a concealed firearm in public is, and never has been, protected by the Second Amendment. The exact wording of the Second Amendment is, \u201ca well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\u201d There is an and in this statement, between \u201ckeep\u201d and \u201cbear,\u201d and it was determined in court in 2008 that those rights are indeed separate. In 2008, the Supreme Court clarified that the right to keep a gun is a personal right, meaning the right to own a firearm and keep it in one\u2019s home for any necessary means of self-defense. To bear the arms would mean the ability to present the firearm if necessary to defend yourself."
"Because of that mass shooting hundred thousand of people gathered up in Washington D.C to protest about gun violence and bring their hope that the government will stricter about gun control, young children marched, holding hands with their parents. Grandmothers and grandfathers wept as they shouted \u201cEnough is enough!\u2019 Students and teachers carried signs that read \u2018Never Again.\u2019 (Tod Olson). There was an election on November, not in Florida but also every state in United States giving their hope that new congress will help for better in gun control and help to stop gun violence in United States."
"Secondly, many of victims\u2019 parents and teachers shared their thoughts about the disadvantages of armed teachers in school. The shooting in Florida has aroused the heated discussions around the United States on gun issues, gun laws, and how to keep communities safe, especially ally school. Students at Stoneman Douglas High School are catalysts for the protest movement. On February 21, US President Donald Trump said that armed teachers could prevent gunshots like the tragedy of 17 people died in Florida on 14.2. He said that armed teachers can finish the attack very quickly and they do not need to wait for the police. Aaron Feis, a football coach who used his body as a shield to protect a student during the shootings at Marjory Stone Douglas. The president said that if this coach can be armed and has the firearms when he ran to the gunman, the coach was brave enough to save a lot of lives, did not doubt about it, but if he had a gun, he would not have to run, just shoot, and so is done \u2018. US leaders are reviewing some of the laws that will increase the age of possession of certain weapons. On top of that, President Donald Trump emphasized about training and armed for about 20% of teachers or school officials \u2013 a longstanding proposal from the American Rifle Association (NRA) \u2013 despite admitting This proposal is controversial that an average attack takes about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, it took five to eight minutes for the police to arrive, and then the attack was over. If the schools have good teachers in arms, they can quickly end the attack. Some dozen states in the US have allowed guns to be brought to school campuses, but Florida is not. And after a young nineteen-year-old murderer killed seventeen people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February fourteenth, many of the students were reluctant to keep that painful torment, so they had made specific responses. Their pressing voices resounded everywhere, in television interviews, on social networks and parades on the street. After the incident, many politicians are still struggling to address the mental health and safety of students and teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas School, but some students in the school are frank and fiercely concerned about gun control rights problem. At other high schools across the country, many students participate in demonstrations of solidarity with Marjory Stoneman Douglas School. There are also many lockups to protest what they say Washington is doing nothing to protect students and teachers. However, the parents of the students who were killed in the shootings, do not think that equipping teachers with weapons is the solution. Mrs. Nicole Hockley, whose son was killed by the school shooting, told Trump that armed teachers did not end violence at school. She said that instead of equipping them with weapons, she wants the government to equip teachers with the knowledge how to prevent these behaviors from the beginning. According to her, it includes prevention and help for those with mental illness. \u2018The teacher has too much responsibility and does not have to take on the responsibility of shooting others,\u2019 said Mark Barden, who also had a son who died in the massacre at school. One teacher shared with Teach Plus that they are not well-trained policemen. They are not soldiers. They are the teachers who are responsible for caring for, teaching and instructing students. The majority of shootings in schools are caused by students. Please do not ask a teacher to open fire to kill a student. Nicole Hockley, the mother of a six-year-old boy who died at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, said that she personally does not do not support this. Instead of equipped weapons for teacher, they can equip teachers with the knowledge how to prevent these potentials from the beginning. The problem is not the gun, but the person behind the gun."
"First, the solution that allows teachers to be armed will give the whole school a reputation to \u2018stay away\u2019. If there is a lunatic or a psycho man out there, it is unlikely for him to go to the schools with teachers that are armed strongly. So it somehow helps to prevent more emergencies, massacre, or shootings. Moreover, if teachers are trained and allowed to have firearms, they will likely prepare more carefully if an emergency occurs."
"The second amendment provides Americas the right to bear arms.
